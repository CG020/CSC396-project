That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now.

4,RES,doctor,"I see, okay. Um, alright, well that's all the questions I had, and uh, sorry one more. Have you been up to date with your immunizations so far?"
4,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been having all my immunizations. Uh, I also feel like, so with a sore throat, I also have some um, pain on the sides, like on my, on my neck. Like I almost feel like some lumps on both sides."
4,RES,doctor,"Oh, I see, I see. Okay, okay. Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?"
4,RES,patient,"Um, just some lozenges."
4,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so just continue uh, just drinking water and taking lozenges just to um, provide some comfort for yourself, and we'll do the test, then we can chat a bit more after."
4,RES,patient,"Okay, sounds good, thank you so much."

5,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I just uh yeah just wanted to figure out what's going on with this cough."
5,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, so it seems like the symptoms have been going on for a few months now. It seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion. Um at this age, one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. Um she does have some other symptoms that um are associated with asthma, like it seems that she gets um, some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well."
5,RES,patient,"OK, yeah that that sounds good. Thank you."
5,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and no worries, and then we'll also do like a full physical examination."

8,MSK,patient,"No, I don't see that. I also actually it might be slightly. It looks a little bit awkward the way she's holding it, so I can't tell if it's misaligned."
8,MSK,doctor,"OK, and any skin changes over the elbow?"
8,MSK,patient,No.
8,MSK,doctor,"Alright Ann. If you were to press over various portions of the elbow, are there any areas that cause pain like the lateral side, medial side, or anterior posterior?"

8,MSK,patient,"No, that's fine."
8,MSK,doctor,"OK, so that that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?"
8,MSK,patient,"Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow."
8,MSK,doctor,"I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down."
8,MSK,patient,OK.
8,MSK,doctor,"An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction."
8,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds good, thank you."
9,MSK,doctor,What brings you in here today?
9,MSK,patient,"I've been having this pain in my knee and it's been going on now for a few weeks.

9,MSK,patient,No limp I can. I can walk OK.
9,MSK,doctor,OK and are you able to run?
9,MSK,patient,"Yeah I can. I can run, but when I do it it causes some pain. I'm able to still run but yeah it it hurts."
9,MSK,doctor,"OK and. So when you palpate your lower knee just under the patella, you said it's a sharp pain, right?"
9,MSK,patient,"Yeah exactly and then when I it's, and it feels kind of achey or when when, like after practice or something like that, but if you press on it it it's sharp."
9,MSK,doctor,"And, uh. Any any kind of like are you able to flex and extend your knee right now if you tried?"
9,MSK,patient,I can yeah.

9,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you notice any kind of swelling or redness or bruising in the area?"
9,MSK,patient,No.
9,MSK,doctor,"no OK, and your ankle and hips you don't have any pain or issues with movement, right?"
9,MSK,patient,"No, not at all. No, no problems with my ankle or hip."
9,MSK,doctor,OK alright yeah. So those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions?
9,MSK,patient,I was just wondering what I can do to make this go away.
9,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely this is something that is what we call Jumpers knee. It's fairly common, uh, amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there. But for now does that sound OK with you?"
9,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, thank you. So you said that you think it's like a patellar tendonitis or something like that?"
9,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, it's patellar tendonitis is commonly called the jumpers knee and it should resolve with the steps that we, especially since it seems like you're in the earlier stages. So it seems like it should be pretty responsive, but if it isn't, there are other steps we can discuss in the future."
9,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
10,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
10,RES,patient,"Hey, so I just for the last couple days I've just been feeling really short of breath really rundown. Just like super tired and you know, normally really active and I'm just, I'm just having a rough go."
10,RES,doctor,Is there is the shortness of breath knew for you?
10,RES,patient,"Yeah yeah, it's just like just like I can't. I don't know like I can't catch up. I kind of just feel I feel a bit weak like I've just been feeling really tired and then because of that I haven't really been eating a lot so. Yeah, I don't know."
10,RES,doctor,"So. You've just been feeling very tired, can you I guess, like tell me a little bit more about your difficulty with breathing. When does it happen?"
10,RES,patient,"I think just like overall, I'm finding it like it's hard to hard to get like super deep breaths it's not like I I can't. I don't get the feeling that I can't breathe. It's just that everything's a little bit more like laborious."
10,RES,doctor,OK. And you said that it started a few days ago. Have you had any other symptoms other than the difficulty breathing and the fatigue?

10,RES,doctor,Are you taking any medications for either problem?
10,RES,patient,I take avodart.
10,RES,doctor,OK.
10,RES,patient,"And for the the reflux I take a tums here and there I used to be on a medication, but it seemed like I kind of figured out the foods that were going to help, so I stopped."
10,RES,doctor,"Great, that's great. Any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental allergies?"
10,RES,patient,"Uh no, no"
10,RES,doctor,"No, and any medical conditions that run in the family? Specifically, anything related to the lungs?"
10,RES,patient,"No, not that I can think of."
10,RES,doctor,And do you you mentioned that your grandkids have came to visit. Do you live alone?
10,RES,patient,Uh no. I live with my wife.
10,RES,doctor,And are you currently working or are you staying at home?
10,RES,patient,"Uh, I'm working from home. I I, I've gone out a few times to see clients. I work as a financial advisor. I've gone to see a couple clients that are really old and have a hard time doing stuff over the phone or over the computer, but I'm like 95% from home."
10,RES,doctor,Have you gone to see any clients in the past three or four days or in the past week?
10,RES,patient,"No, no, it's probably been a couple weeks since I saw anyone ."
10,RES,doctor,Sure OK. And do you smoke? Or did you ever smoke at the past?
10,RES,patient,"No, I I maybe did for maybe like three years in my 20s. It wasn’t heavily yes."
10,RES,doctor,Any marijuana or recreational drugs?
10,RES,patient,No.
10,RES,doctor,Any alcohol?
10,RES,patient,I usually have a whiskey or two on the weekends.
10,RES,doctor,"OK alright. Uh so it sounds like you have some sort of an infection with the fevers and fatigue and muscle aches, and then the difficulty breathing, of course, and then your sensation, that sensation that you are having a very cool sort of a sore throat and cough that you might be getting. We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet."
10,RES,patient,Thats what I was worried about.
10,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. We’ll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate as much as possible and your results should come out in 24 to 48 hours and then the public health nurse should tell you what to do if your results are positive."
10,RES,patient,"OK, OK no, that sounds fair,"
10,RES,doctor,"All right. Well, let's do a physical exam and then go from there."
10,RES,patient,OK. Thank you.
10,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
11,RES,doctor,So what brings you in?
11,RES,patient,"OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?"
11,RES,patient,I was diagnosed when I was eight.
11,RES,doctor,You're 10 now.
11,RES,patient,That's right.
11,RES,doctor,"So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use, kind of as needed?"
11,RES,patient,Yeah.
11,RES,doctor,OK and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what?
11,RES,patient,"Uhm? No, I don't have that one."
11,RES,doctor,OK. You just have the one that you take is needed. Do you take any other medications?
11,RES,patient,Uh no I don't take anything else.
11,RES,doctor,Just the one is it a it's a puffer?
11,RES,patient,Yes.
11,RES,doctor,"OK, and you're using it more than normal, so how often were you normally using it?"
11,RES,patient,Um I was only using it like I don't know. Maybe once every two weeks or so. Not very often. But now I'm using it like almost everyday like five six times a week.
11,RES,doctor,"OK, any are you? Does it usually turned out that you need it like during certain times like say when you're exercising or when it's cold?"
11,RES,patient,"Um I find I use it more, both like when it when it's right after I like, run around after gym during recess. Um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, any other triggers that you can think of?"
11,RES,patient,"No, no other triggers."
11,RES,doctor,Normally get more in certain seasons?
11,RES,patient,"I. I guess no, no big changes there. I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like. Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like pollen and stuff like that."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, so you have allergies too?"
11,RES,patient,"I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, I see I see. Yeah, that would make sense. No. OK, uh, so you say you've had more coughing lately, is that right? You said the last two weeks."
11,RES,patient,Last two weeks.
11,RES,doctor,Last two weeks. Is your cough and a dry cough?
11,RES,patient,Yeah.

11,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I've been wheezing a lot, actually."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, uh and that's uh. Do you use your bronchodilator every time that you're wheezing?"
11,RES,patient,"When it gets really bad, like when I get so easy that I find it hard to breathe."
11,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're getting Wheezy even more times than then you're having to use your bronchodilator."
11,RES,patient,"Yes, that's right."
11,RES,doctor,OK. Are you having any symptoms at night time?
11,RES,patient,"Yeah, how they don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms, but I been having it maybe like every other day or like you know, every two days or so."
11,RES,doctor,"OK. And when you have these so when you have these episodes, you're copping your wheezy. Do you feel like you're having a hard time breathing?"
11,RES,patient,"Yep, that's right."
11,RES,doctor,Do you feel it gets tight in your chest?
11,RES,patient,Yes.
11,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, have you had any any colds lately? Or any infections? ."
11,RES,patient,"Um no, no, nothing like that."

11,RES,doctor,"We just ask those questions because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure that that's not, you know what's happening right now. We probably will do a covid swab just because of the times that we're living in right now, but I just want to ask you a few more questions before I go talk to the doctor. So do you have besides your asthma, do you have any health problems?"
11,RES,patient,"Oh no, no no."
11,RES,doctor,"OK. And you said, besides the bronchodilator, you're not taking any medications."
11,RES,patient,No.
11,RES,doctor,And you think you might have allergies in the spring? Do you have allergies to anything else that you know?

11,RES,doctor,Anyone in your family have any other breathing problems?
11,RES,patient,No.
11,RES,doctor,Anyone else in the family have any allergies?
11,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."

11,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, I think that's all my questions that I had for you today. What do you like to do for fun?"
11,RES,patient,Oh I'm I like playing games online with my friends and and before covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together.
11,RES,doctor,"It sounds really cool. Hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you don't have any, you don't have to use your your medications every time you play sports 'cause that's no fun. And"
11,RES,patient,No.
11,RES,doctor,"You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said and yeah weâ€™ll come back and see you shortly, hopefully maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma."
11,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."

But she didn't hit herself or anything like that."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Alright, um, and in terms of the type of pain she's having right now, did she say if it was a dull, achy kind of pain, or is it sharp?"
12,MSK,patient,She says it's aching a lot.
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and has it been constant since she um, started experiencing this? Or does it come and go?"
12,MSK,patient,"It's, it's been pretty constant since then and yeah, she just kind of keep, keeping, she's kind of keep, just keeping it like, her arms extended um, and then yeah, just holding on to it."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, and then, is the pain just in the elbow, or does it radiate down into her hands or up to her shoulders?"

12,MSK,doctor,Have you done any travel recently?
12,MSK,patient,Nope.
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Alright, and those are all the questions I had for history taking. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um, I'm just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms. Do you see any, um, redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left?"
12,MSK,patient,"No, I don't see that. No, I don't see any changes."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay, how about um, any muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes, like bruises?"
12,MSK,patient,"Um, no, I don't see anything like that."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay. How about, um, when you palpate her elbows, does, is she in pain?"
12,MSK,patient,"Um, she doesn't really let me, but if I try to, I think that does cause her some pain."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay, how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles?"
12,MSK,patient,"Um, no, not as much."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay, how about her biceps and triceps?"
12,MSK,patient,"Um, no, not really."
12,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. Um, alright, and those are all the questions that I kind of had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?"
12,MSK,patient,"No, I just wanted to find out if she broke something, or like, yeah, I didn't know what was going on."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Yeah, it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you're giving me, it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation. Um, and that's usually caused in young children when they're like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight, um, which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit. Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes. Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again. Um, if she's still experiencing pain, we can continue keeping it on a splint, um, but otherwise, I don't think we need any imaging for this at this um, at this time. So did you have any questions or any concerns about that?"
12,MSK,patient,"No, I think that's, um, that's a good plan."
12,MSK,doctor,"Okay, great. Um, thank you."
12,MSK,patient,Thank you.
13,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
13,MSK,patient,"I'm I'm here because my right knee is very painful. It looks kind of swollen and it's it's also a little bit warm so I'm just worried, I'm worried about it and I was wondering if you could look at it."
13,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly, um. So where are you feeling the the pain exactly?"
13,MSK,patient,"So it's where, so right in the middle of my knee. So just below the bone that, the big knee bone."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, so like underneath the kneecap, like below that?"
13,MSK,patient,Yeah just just a little bit below.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, so slightly below the Patella. Sounds like somewhere in the region of the tibial through tuberosity."
13,MSK,patient,Right.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when did this pain start?"
13,MSK,patient,It started about two weeks ago.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, two weeks ago when the pain started, was there any trauma or could you remember any movement that that caused the pain?"
13,MSK,patient,"Nothing like that, but I recently found out that I had some osteoarthritis on my left knee, so I was trying to put more pressure on my right knee one whenever I was doing like gardening work um and I think something something may have happened when I was doing that, something maybe, maybe I put too much strain on it."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see an. Alright, like are you doing a lot of kneeling on on or during the gardening work?"
13,MSK,patient,I am.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um, and. How long has the pain been going on for, has it been constant over these two weeks?"
13,MSK,patient,"Yes, it has been."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how would you describe the pain, is it sharp, burning, achy?"
13,MSK,patient,"I would say mostly achy, but it can be sharp."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you feel the pain radiate anywhere else?"
13,MSK,patient,"No, just it's pretty local."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you tried anything to make the pain better?"
13,MSK,patient,"I tried some topical like what are those like ice and fire gels. Those seem to help temporarily, but the pain comes back."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK. And. Have you tried, has anything made the pain worse?"
13,MSK,patient,"I guess like when I kneel down on it, it gets painful or If I touch it or palpate it, I guess painful if I'm I'm flexing my knee too much that hurts as well. Kind of keeping it straight and not touching it makes it feel better."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and. What would you say the severity of the pain is with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and one being the least pain?"
13,MSK,patient,I give it about a 6.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you had a pain like this in your right knee before?"
13,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like this and I have osteoarthritis in my left knee but it feels different."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and um. OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?"

13,MSK,doctor,"like IV drugs, no, OK. And in the family or is there a history of any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?"
13,MSK,patient,No.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK. So next I just wanted to do the physical exam portion and ask you to have a look at the knee first and let me know if the if you're having any swelling, redness or warmth to the knee compared to the other side."
13,MSK,patient,Sure.
13,MSK,doctor,"Sorry so you are having, having swelling, warmth and redness to the right knee?"
13,MSK,patient,Yes.
13,MSK,doctor,OK and are you having pain to like palpation is there a specific spot you can press on that causes a sharp pain?
13,MSK,patient,"Um so just below that kneecap area there is some swelling there and when I press down on that swollen area, it causes a bit of pain."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK. And are you able to fully bend, bend and straighten the knee?"
13,MSK,patient,"I can do that, but when I bend my knee it really hurts."
13,MSK,doctor,OK. And are you able to walk normally or do you have a limp?
13,MSK,patient,"Um I can walk normally, it just hurts."
13,MSK,doctor,OK. So that was a everything that I wanted to ask today on the history and and physical. Was there anything? That you maybe I forgot about you wanted to add?
13,MSK,patient,"No, I don't think so."
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, so right now it's sounding like this could possibly be a knee Bursitis. Or Prepatellar, or sorry, infra patellar bursitis or a prepatellar bursistis which are the kind of the more common types. One thing to make sure that we rule out would be a septic Bursitis. Although you're not having any fevers or chills so that makes it a little bit less likely."
13,MSK,patient,Mmmm
13,MSK,doctor,"But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection. And as well if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease and any, such as a meniscal injury, or like a ligamental injury from all of the like kneeling and and repetitive movements. But right now I think it's mostly sounding like a knee bursitis."
13,MSK,patient,OK.
13,MSK,doctor,"OK, and treatment for that will be activity modification as well as using things like as um NSAIDS and icing to help with um the inflammation."
13,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds good, thank you."
14,RES,doctor,How are you doing today?
14,RES,patient,"I'm doing OK, I just had this cough that's really started to bug me."
14,RES,doctor,"OK, thanks for coming into the emergency Department today. We will really try to get this sorted out for you. How long is this cough been going on for?"

14,RES,patient,"Yeah, maybe when I was younger, I don't know when I had the flu or something like that."
14,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, so I'll ask you few more questions about your cough. So it started 5 days ago, has it gotten any worse or better since then?"
14,RES,patient,"It's been getting worse for sure. It's like going all all throughout the day, and it's been even interrupting sleep."
14,RES,doctor,"Oh, geez. That's too bad. Do you find that it, does it feel really dry or are you bringing up like gunky stuff?"

14,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, well I think that just about covers the things that I wanted to ask you today so. Based on the symptoms you're experiencing. It sounds like it could be some kind of infective process, like maybe some kind of viral infection that we're concerned about, particularly this year. I'd really like to get a swab done on you. It's not necessarily covid, but it potentially could be. So what we're going to have to ask you to do is to self isolate you and your family for 14 days and hopefully will get the results back shortly and you'll know whether your COVID test is positive or not."
14,RES,patient,OK.
14,RES,doctor,Does that sound like a good plan to you?
14,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good."

15,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've been coughing for a few months now and so that's the problem."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, and how many months have you been coughing for?"
15,RES,patient,"Just over two, I would say, and it's been I've been bringing up this yellow, greenish sputum. It's kind of gross."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, and how, how much of the sputum would you say you're bringing up in an average day? Like a teaspoon? Tablespoon?"
15,RES,patient,": Oh I see OK. I don't know, maybe a few teaspoons throughout the day."
15,RES,doctor,OK.
15,RES,patient,"At first I thought I I I had a, a chest infection, but even after antibiotics from my GP, or or my family doctor, It never cleared up."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, and so when did you go on the antibiotics?"
15,RES,patient,"Ah so this is about, uh, about a month ago."
15,RES,doctor,Mhmm.
15,RES,patient,"And yeah, so I went to see my family doctor about the cough then and dad was prescribed some antibiotics. I think azithromycin and it, it still didn't, it didn't do anything."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. And do you find that your cough has been getting worse since then?"
15,RES,patient,"Uh, I would say the cough has been about the same."
15,RES,doctor,"OK. But how about the sputum that you're bringing up, has that increased?"
15,RES,patient,"Uh, it's about the same, but it definitely I would say there's a pink tinge in the sputum now. Every once in awhile I've noticed more than than before."
15,RES,doctor,OK. And did this all start after the chest infection or did you have something like this occur before?
15,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, this all started after."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. Was there anything that happened around that time? Any new environment that you were exposed to?"
15,RES,patient,"Ah, well, I did go to India a few months ago."
15,RES,doctor,"OK, and how many months was that? Was that also like two months ago?"
15,RES,patient,"Yeah, about that, probably closer to three or four, but yeah, right around the time that that I think this, uhm cough started or just before I got back."

15,RES,patient,"Uh, it's pretty, it's pretty bad all day actually and it's been impacting my sleep because I've been coughing at night too."
15,RES,doctor,"I see. And, um, in terms of things that make it worse, anything you do around the house or at work that makes the coughing worse?"
15,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, I guess if I'm just moving around a little bit more it might bring it on a little bit more, but it's pretty bad all day."

16,RES,doctor,"Well um, I'll do a physical exam, look inside your throat, look inside your mouth, sorry, and listen to your chest, and uh, ensure that nothing else is going on, that you don't have anything like, say, strep throat or mono or you don't have uh, pneumonia, uh, bacterial pneumonia, for instance. Oftentimes um, symptoms that you have are caused by viruses and don't need to be treated with antibiotics, uh, but I'll do a physical exam, and maybe have a look at your labs as well, and then decide accordingly."
16,RES,patient,"Okay, sounds good, thank you."

So we are, you're a lot of your symptoms do overlap with those of Covid, so we are going to take a swab today and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but you should isolate for 14 days. And that includes from family family members if possible. Uhm, and basically just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they get worse, or you're having like neurological symptoms, you should seek help from the ER, but otherwise keep yourself hydrated, eat well. If you have a humidifier in the basement, use it, and for your fevers you can take antipyretics like Tylenol. And just it's it's just a lot of supportive care. How does that sound and obviously like if your symptoms aren't going away after like a few weeks, call us back and it could be something like bacterial, in which case we can give you some antibiotics."

19,RES,patient,No.
19,RES,doctor,"No. OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for her today, so definitely since there is a risk that she might be having another ear infection, we will need to do like a full physical examination. I'll have to look into her ear to see if I see any inflammation or perforation and then based on that we'll discuss some management. She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right? So we may even do some conservative management and get her to take some maybe pain medications and then go from there. Or ear drops."
19,RES,patient,OK.
19,RES,doctor,"Uh, but yeah, so we'll do the examination and then go from there. She said she has, besides the fever and that your pain she's not really having any other symptoms so? I don't think she needs to get tested for Covid right now, but that's something we can consider as well if she develops other symptoms."
19,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds great. Thank you."

20,RES,doctor,"So, uh, yeah, it's sounding like, like it could be tuberculosis based on the kind of timeline of your symptoms and so and cough and hemoptysis and so we'll do a test for that, like an acid fast test of the sputum. Get a chest X Ray. And if it is tuberculosis, it will require a prolonged course of antibiotics, so that I'll be over several months. Umm, and so I we'll get the infectious disease team involved to help kind of guide our management with the appropriate antibiotic choice, if it does come back to be tuberculosis."

Uh and then we'll also get like your, some of your blood work and chest X-ray just to see if there's any like pneumonia. And lastly we'll just get like a Covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with Covid symptoms. Um and yeah so we'll, so that's what we'll do um and I'll let the emergency department know that you're on your way. I think you'll need to get all those tests there, and then they'll decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics um from there, OK?"

Try to stay away from your mom as well. And based on the results, you'll get more guidance from public health nurses, and you should just continue to sort of rest and drink lots of water. Maybe take Tylenol or Advil if that's making you feel better and hopefully your symptoms will get better. If not, if you feel like your symptoms are persisting for days or week or so, or you're having worsening symptoms, definitely come back or give us a call."

27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, I see. Um, alright, and um, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any other medical conditions?"
27,MSK,patient,"No. Yeah, otherwise I'm healthy. I've never been to the doctor much."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright. Um, and are you on any medications?"
27,MSK,patient,No.
27,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. And um, are you up-to-date with your immunizations?"
27,MSK,patient,Yes.
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and do you have any allergies?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh, no."
27,MSK,doctor,Any family history of musculoskeletal diseases?
27,MSK,patient,"No, not that I know of."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Uh, and any family history of autoimmune conditions?"
27,MSK,patient,"Um, no."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, do you smoke at all?"
27,MSK,doctor,"No. Um, do you consume marijuana?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh, no."
27,MSK,doctor,"Uh, do you drink alcohol?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh no, just, just with friends sometimes on the weekends, but not really."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, and then, where do you live right now and who do you live with?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh, I live just outside of town with my parents in a house."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay. And um, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
27,MSK,patient,"Um, no, I've been at home."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, any sick contacts?"
27,MSK,patient,No.
27,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. So now we're just going to move on to um, the physical exam part of this. So can you take a look at both your shoulders and let me know if you see any redness or swelling?"
27,MSK,patient,"Um, I don't think I see any redness or swelling, but um, my right shoulder and my arm just seems a little bit lower than my left one."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, okay, any um, warmth on, on that shoulder?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, not that I can feel."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?"
27,MSK,patient,"Um, deformity, I, I do feel like kind of uh, like my shoulder's dropped and like there's just kind of this uh, little, like divots, where like the shoulder should be."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, okay. And can you palpate that area for me? Just um, the bones in that area, so like right where your arm would connect to your shoulder and then kind of on your shoulder blade. Does that hurt when you press down?"
27,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it hurts a lot."
27,MSK,doctor,"Okay, so some tenderness and pain in the acromion process and scapula. Um, and if you press down on your biceps, triceps, does that hurt?"
27,MSK,patient,"Not as much, no."
27,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. And then can I get you to um, can you lift your shoulder up at all? Like to where, to the point where your fingers are touch, like reaching the ceiling?"
27,MSK,patient,"No, I, I can't. I can't move it at all."
27,MSK,doctor,"Alright, so um, it sounds like you have a shoulder dislocation. Um, so we are going to do an x-ray of your shoulder joint first to make sure that it's, it's just a dislocation and there aren't any broken bones or fractures. And then um, we can resolve this by doing something called a closed reduction, um, to try to put the joint back in its place."
27,MSK,patient,Okay.
27,MSK,doctor,"Um, and if that closed reduction doesn't work, then uh, you may need surgery for like a, um, a weak shoulder joint, or if like ligaments um, aren't like, strong enough and it's it continues to happen."
27,MSK,patient,Okay.
27,MSK,doctor,"Um, otherwise, we can keep it immobilized for a few days to a few weeks, um, depending on how bad the dislocation is. Um, and then once that's removed, you can do some rehab as well to restore some range of motion. Does that sound like a good plan? Do you have any questions or concerns in the meantime?"
27,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, I think that's, uh, that's great."
27,MSK,doctor,Okay.
28,MSK,doctor,What brings you here today?
28,MSK,patient,"Hi, I've been having this back pain for the past month, so I'd just like something for it an and you know image it if possible just to figure out what it is."
28,MSK,doctor,"You've been having it for the last month, is this the first time you're having this back pain?"
28,MSK,patient,Yeah yes.
28,MSK,doctor,OK and where exactly are you having the back pain?
28,MSK,patient,It's in my lower back.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what kind of pain are you experiencing, is it like a sharp stabbing pain or is that a dull aching pain?"
28,MSK,patient,It's kind of dull and achy but sometimes I feel like I have little spasms in my back.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how often are you getting these spasms?"
28,MSK,patient,Um I'd say like two to three times a week.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. And it is this back pain constant, or does it come come and go?"
28,MSK,patient,"It's pretty constant, but it gets worse with certain things."
28,MSK,doctor,"So one month ago when it started before then, did you injure yourself at all or, were you doing anything that brought on the pain or did the pain come on gradually?"
28,MSK,patient,"So I work in this factory where I move a lot of boxes and I think I may have like lifted a really heavy box or lifted it in an improper position because that's when, that night is when my back started hurting."

28,MSK,patient,For the past 30 years.

28,MSK,patient,I'd say it's pretty. It's been pretty similar to the start.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. And does the back pain move anywhere, like for example does it shoot down your legs at all?"
28,MSK,patient,No OK. Have you tried anything that has helped you?
28,MSK,patient,"I've tried some topical analgesics, and you know those fire and ice gels and I think sometimes that helps, but it's always temporary."
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. And what kind of things make your pain worse like, bending down as opposed to stretching backwards?"
28,MSK,patient,"Yeah, bending down like it when I flex my back that hurts more than if I straighten it out."

28,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so I'm just gonna ask a few questions, maybe get you to do some movements and see what hurts the most."
28,MSK,patient,OK.
28,MSK,doctor,"So when you press your hand down, down your spine. Is it hurt at all in the lower back with palpation?"
28,MSK,patient,"Um it kinda hurts right in the middle, uh, just above the buttocks area an where like my tailbone almost is"
28,MSK,doctor,"I see. And, uh, any kind of pain with lying down and then raising your legs straight up without bending the knees."
28,MSK,patient,"I can try that. Um that hurts a little bit, yeah."
28,MSK,doctor,And does it hurt in the lower back or near the front of your hips?
28,MSK,patient,That hurts in my lower back.
28,MSK,doctor,"And any kind of redness or swelling that you've noticed at all? I know it's in the back, so it might be more difficult to see."
28,MSK,patient,"Um no, I don't see anything like that."
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. And are you, has your gait, changed at all, or is it, are you able to walk without a limp or anything?"
28,MSK,patient,I'm able to walk without a limp.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so and then, uh, bending down you said hurts more than standing up or extending your back, right?"
28,MSK,patient,Yes.
28,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me?"
28,MSK,patient,"No, just like how can I treat this?"
28,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging. But first we would just like to try some of the conservative management. Is that OK with you?"
28,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
28,MSK,doctor,"You're welcome, alright take care."
29,RES,doctor,"To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?"
29,RES,patient,Really I just don't I I don't feel quite right like I've had this pain in my chest for five days now and I've been just feeling kind of out of breath.
29,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, um where are you feeling this pain?"
29,RES,patient,"Um, it's it's kind of um. On the left side of my chest and it's just like a tiny. It's like a lingering sharp pain. I don't really feel it anywhere else. It's just kind of there all the time right now. I I've never had anything like this before."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're not feeling the pain radiate any to any other locations. You're just feeling it sort of in the one spot on the left side?"
29,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and since this pain started 5 days ago, has it gotten any better, any worse, or stayed the same?"
29,RES,patient,"Like when I when it started I was just I was just like sitting on my couch. Um and now it's harder if I'm, it's worse if I'm walking around, like if I walk just down the street to get the mail. But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?"
29,RES,patient,"It's I don't the the pain is, but I I'm not I can't catch my breath when I'm doing that."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and how far could you usually walk, or um?"
29,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, usually walk before I go for long walks like every day, like probably like 5 kilometers or something."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so prior to this happening you were feeling well?"
29,RES,patient,"Yeah, totally. I've not ever had any problems with my heart or lungs or anything. I thought it was maybe just like a chest infection. But I I don't know anymore."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so you've had that, the difficulties breathing and the pain. And have you had any other symptoms?"
29,RES,patient,"Mmm I think it's just those those, the two things that I said."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?"
29,RES,patient,No. Nothing like that.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any nausea or vomiting?"
29,RES,patient,No.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, how is your energy been? Have you experienced any like significant fatigue?"
29,RES,patient,"Um. Not. Well, I mean, I've been doing less stuff because it's harder to breathe like I'm getting kind of like I can't catch my breath. So I guess maybe maybe a little bit like fatigue."
29,RES,doctor,"I see OK, but feeling fine energy-wise prior to the two 5 days ago?"
29,RES,patient,"Yeah, totally."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, uh and, have you been having any night sweats?"
29,RES,patient,"Uh, no, no I haven't."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any unusual headaches?"
29,RES,patient,No.
29,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you felt as though your heart is racing or beating out of your chest at all?"
29,RES,patient,"No, no, it's just that like sharp that sharp pain."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any episodes of lightheadedness or feeling like you, you might might faint?"
29,RES,patient,"No, no, just the difficulty breathing that scares to me, but it hasn't been like that."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had a cough?"
29,RES,patient,"No, no, that's the thing, that it seems weird, right?"
29,RES,doctor,"OK, um sometimes things can be associated with a cough so we'll absolutely look into what the causes of your symptoms are today. But you haven't brought up any any blood or any sputum?"
29,RES,patient,No no.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any wheezing with your with your breath?"
29,RES,patient,I don't know. I don't think so.
29,RES,doctor,"Alright, and how about any abdominal pain?"
29,RES,patient,"No, I mean the pain is like, yeah, it's in my chest. Yeah, that's not in my it's not in my belly at all."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any urinary problems?"
29,RES,patient,"No, I mean so I had. I had a I had a hysterectomy. Weeks ago, maybe like maybe like a month ago now, um? So after that it was, you know, feeling a little. Like I was kind of not drinking as much and that so I wasn't peeing as much then, but I think it's normal now."
29,RES,doctor,OK um. And how have you recovered since the hysterectomy? Were you like bedbound for quite awhile afterwards or were you up an active?
29,RES,patient,"Really, it was not really long that I may be a few days, I wasn't. I wasn't walking as much, but I thought it was like back to my normal self."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you recovered from that surgery quickly. And what was the surgery for?"
29,RES,patient,"Uh, I uh. I mean I, I'm done having kids and I, uh, I had. I was just having really heavy periods still so, uh, and you know a lot of pain there, so hat's why I had hysterectomy."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and have you had any bowel problems?"
29,RES,patient,No no.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any skin changes or or rashes?"
29,RES,patient,No.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any joint pains or or leg pains or muscle pains?"
29,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
29,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, so in regards to past health, any previous medical diagnosis?"
29,RES,patient,"Uh, no. Just like I had the hysterectomy but I I don't like take any medications I don't have like high blood pressure or anything."
29,RES,doctor,OK so no prescription medications or over the counter medications you take regularly like supplements or?
29,RES,patient,"No, just just to those like the Advil and the Tylenol I was taking for the pain."
29,RES,doctor,OK. And any other surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
29,RES,patient,"Uh, like I have my wisdom teeth out when I was like a teenager. That's it though."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, then, how about any allergies?"
29,RES,patient,None.
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and are your immunizations up to date?"
29,RES,patient,"I think so, um. Yeah, yeah I don't. Yeah, I don't think, I didn't get anything that was supposed to."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, well, that's good. And, uh, has anybody in your family experienced anything like this before?"
29,RES,patient,"My mom had a heart attack when she was like in her 70s. Uh. Other than that, I don't. I don't know. I don't think so."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, any, um, cancers in the family or or bleeding disorders or coagulations disorders?"
29,RES,patient,"Um, no, I don't think so."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, so I haven't heard of anybody in the family having like a blood clot, or or a thrombosis anywhere?"
29,RES,patient,"I think my mom's like cousin, but not no one like not like my parents or anything."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, um, so the next few questions I just wanted to ask about your personal and kind of lifestyle habits a little bit. But first, could you tell me about your living situation?"
29,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah I live. Um, like I said like I'm done having kids but I have 2 two kids. They're teenagers. I live um, with them and my husband and, uh. We live not far from here."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and what do you do for work?"
29,RES,patient,"Um, Im an accountant."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
29,RES,patient,Um maybe a glass of wine on like the weekends but? Not other than no.
29,RES,doctor,OK and do you smoke cigarettes?
29,RES,patient,"I do, I'm trying to stop. I smoke maybe like. I don't know like 5 per day or something at this point."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, but it sounds like you've been working on cutting down which is great. Um and have you used any other recreational drugs?"
29,RES,patient,"Um, no, no. I mean, when I was like younger I sometimes like would use marijuana, but I haven't really recently."
29,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been any been on any like long trips recently?"
29,RES,patient,No I wish.
29,RES,doctor,"Fair enough, vacation would be great. Um, OK so. But that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on on history, were going to run some investigations. I am concerned that you might have a pulmonary embolism, and so we're going to do some lab work and imaging to investigate that."
29,RES,patient,OK I yeah. Is that scary? Is that bad?
29,RES,doctor,"It can vary from being mild to severe, and so that's what we want to get. Some of the imaging and lab work to see well to first confirm if that's what you actually have, and if so, offer the right treatment."
29,RES,patient,OK thanks doctor.
29,RES,doctor,Welcome will get that started.
30,RES,doctor,"I heard that you've been having, uh, some difficulty breathing and you've been coughing. Can you tell a little, tell me a little bit more about that."
30,RES,patient,"Yeah, so uh a couple of days ago. I just started to not feel so well and I've been having this cough and trouble breathing."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, um, have you ever had anything like this before?"
30,RES,patient,"I do have a, uh, cough regularly, but I mean, I, I think that's related to maybe smoking. It's something that was going on for a few years. This coughs a little bit different."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, in what way is this different?"
30,RES,patient,"It's been happening more often throughout the day and. And bringing up more more mucus, it seems like."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, and then you said it start started a couple days ago, is that correct?"
30,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think like Monday, so, uh, yeah I guess like 3 days ago then."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, and since you noticed it has it gotten worse over those three days."
30,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say uh today's the worst day I've continually felt um sick."
30,RES,doctor,OK. And how frequently are you coughing?
30,RES,patient,Uh I would say maybe a couple of times per hour. I'm I'm filling up a some tissues with sputum.
30,RES,doctor,And what does that? What does that sputum look like?
30,RES,patient,It's like a dark greenish yellow colour.
30,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, um and. Is there anything that you've changed recently in your life or any kind of things that have provoked your cough that you know of?"
30,RES,patient,"Ugh, no, I can't think of anything. I've been kind of sticking to my regular routines."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that makes, uh, makes it worse, say any position or anything that you do in your day to day routine you find makes you cough more?"
30,RES,patient,Um And not really I can't. I can't think of anything.
30,RES,doctor,"OK. And, have you taken any any medicine or anything to try to help with us?"
30,RES,patient,"Um. No, I I've I I do have a little bit of pain so I was. I did take some Tylenol and some Advil over the last few days, but that's about it."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, Ok. Did you find that they helped at all?"
30,RES,patient,"A little bit yeah, but it would just kind of take the edge off of the pain for a little bit and it came back."
30,RES,doctor,And what kind of pain is it that you're experiencing?
30,RES,patient,"Um, it's kind of a a sharp pain over on the like the right side of my chest like maybe belly area."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, OK um the right side of your chest and belly area. Yeah OK, so is that pain, is it, did it start around the same time as the cough?"
30,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think it, it might have started a little bit after."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, and is this a pain that you've ever had before?"
30,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like this happen before."
30,RES,doctor,OK. Is the pain primarily there when you cough or is it present at all times?
30,RES,patient,"I would say more so when I cough or if I'm like taking a big breath. Um yeah, kind of after after I have a coughing episode I take a deep breath and I really will feel the pain then."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, and and um, you said that it's a sharp pain?"
30,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, more of a sharp pain."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and is it any worse when you're doing activity, like when you're up and walking around?"
30,RES,patient,"No, don't notice it with any any activity."
30,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, um an since uh, since this coughing and this this right sided pain that you're talking about began, have you noticed any fevers?"
30,RES,patient,"I think, yeah, I've been hot the last few days and I I checked my temperature earlier today and it was like 38.6 so that was one of the reasons why I wanted to come in actually."
30,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, well I'm glad that I'm really glad that you came in because yeah, we really want to get this looked into. Have you been around anyone that's been sick recently?"
30,RES,patient,"No, but I I do some volunteer work at one of the homeless shelters at a few times a week, so I am around a lot of people."
30,RES,doctor,OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
30,RES,patient,"No, I've been at home. And and doing the volunteer work."
30,RES,doctor,"OK um. OK, and can you just give me an idea of any? Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly or anything you take medication for?"
30,RES,patient,"Um yeah, I have type 2 diabetes. And I I take Metformin. Um I think an SGLT 2 inhibitor and then I use insulin for that as well. And I have some, it has affected my kidneys as well. The diabetes I mean."
30,RES,doctor,"OK, do you have a history of high blood pressure?"
30,RES,patient,I do yes.
30,RES,doctor,"OK, do you take medication for that?"
30,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I do. It starts with an ""a"" I think, amlodipine."
30,RES,doctor,OK OK and do you have any history of heart problems?
30,RES,patient,"No, not that I know. No, I haven't really had any chest pain. On the left side anyway."
30,RES,doctor,"Um, So you said that you have had a cough for a really long time, a dryer cough then you're having sputum now. But is that something you've seen the doctor for?"
30,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I think I was called like bronchitis in the past or something. Something like that. One of the doctors, my family doctor told me it was because I was a smoker."
30,RES,doctor,"OK. So just to make sure I have your list of medications, you take amlodipine, insulin"
30,RES,patient,"Um, and then yeah, amlodipine, uh, yeah, I think that that that's everything. Oh a multivitamin too."
30,RES,doctor,OK cool. I just wanted to ask you a few questions questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you live here in town?
30,RES,patient,"I do. Yeah, I live with my wife and at a house nearby."

31,MSK,doctor,What brings you in here today?
31,MSK,patient,"So my back has been killing me it's been hurting for the past two months, but recently it's gotten worse. I'd say over the past week or two weeks it's gotten really bad and no over the counter medication is helping with the pain. It's I'm finding it hard to walk. I can't feel anything in the groin area and I'm having so many bladder accidents."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, and so this pain started two months ago, but it's progressed to like these other symptoms as well?"

31,MSK,doctor,"OK and did anything happened prior to the pain, any injuries at all that you experienced?"
31,MSK,patient,"Two months ago I was in a motor vehicle accident um an I think my back started hurting then but they did some imaging it's and turned out like one of the discs there was a slip in a disc or something, but at that point the pain was just achey and I don't really have any in any of these other issues. But over the past two weeks it's gotten sharp and I'm having all these other symptoms."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, um and. So you're having the set like what's called, some numbness in your groin. Is that unilateral, like on one side or both sides?"

31,MSK,patient,Um I would say it's like an 8 or 9.
31,MSK,doctor,"Eight or nine OK, and does it get worse with any, any motions at all?"
31,MSK,patient,"I think it's worse with um, I don't know like, it's worse with anything, anytime, anytime I tried to move it, it hurts."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you just improved with rest complete rest."
31,MSK,patient,Yeah.
31,MSK,doctor,"OK. Does it travel in, does the pain travel anywhere else, does it shoot down your legs at all?"
31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so it does shoot down my legs and I'm having a hard time walking because of that."
31,MSK,doctor,Is it both legs or just one?
31,MSK,patient,"It's mostly on my right, but the left one isn't the same as it used to be either."
31,MSK,doctor,OK
31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I'm having a hard time like getting up from a chair and things like that."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, and anything that you've tried that has helped relieve some of your symptoms."
31,MSK,patient,I've tried like over the counter counter and ibuprofen. I've tried some topical analgesics and nothing seems to be working.
31,MSK,doctor,OK. And. Have you experienced any trauma? So you mentioned you had a car accident rate two months ago?
31,MSK,patient,"Yes, that was. Yeah, that was two months ago."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK and then. Were you in the hospital, admitted to the hospital for for a while, or how, what happened in your treatment?"
31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I was. I was taken to the ER. They did like a full work up on me. The only thing on my back that they found was a slipped disc and then they said that should that shouldn't cause me too much pain. But if I was having any of these symptoms that I'm having now I should go back, or see a doctor at least. And and otherwise I was fine like I didn't lose a lot of blood or I didn't need any surgical interventions at that point."
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. And have you been having any other symptoms or any any pain in any other joints or muscles?"

31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things."

31,MSK,doctor,"OK, do you drink alcohol?"
31,MSK,patient,No.
31,MSK,doctor,And any recreational drugs like marijuana?
31,MSK,patient,No.
31,MSK,doctor,OK. I'm just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination.
31,MSK,patient,Sure.
31,MSK,doctor,"Are you able to bend down or extend your back at all, or is it too painful?"
31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I can't do that. It's too painful."
31,MSK,doctor,"Do you notice any kind of redness, swelling in and around your back?"
31,MSK,patient,Um not that I can tell.
31,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about if you press down on the your lower back, does it hurt?"
31,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that hurts."
31,MSK,doctor,OK. And are you experiencing the numbness right now and in your groin area?
31,MSK,patient,I am.
31,MSK,doctor,"Are you able to raise your legs when in a lying position with straight legs, knees not bending at all, they are able to raise without any pain?"
31,MSK,patient,"No, I can't do that. It's yeah, it's too painful."
31,MSK,doctor,"I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?"
31,MSK,patient,"No, just like how can I fix this?"
31,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
31,MSK,patient,"No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help."
31,MSK,doctor,You're welcome and will get back to you shortly.
32,MSK,doctor,How can I help you?
32,MSK,patient,"Hi, I just was brought in here today. I had a fall just waking up coming down the stairs. I fell off the last few stairs and just fell onto the right side and on, right onto my head and now, uh I couldn't even I could barely stand up and put any weight on my hip. It's the right hip."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, Uhm, so what caused you to fall in the 1st place? Did you just lose balance, were you dizzy?"
32,MSK,patient,"I think I just I missed, I wasn't dizzy or anything. I just missed one of the steps and just slipped, slipped down the stairs."
32,MSK,doctor,OK.
32,MSK,patient,But it was just the last few stairs I didn't have like I didn't hit my head or anything like that.
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when was this?"
32,MSK,patient,This was a so I guess now two hours ago.
32,MSK,doctor,"Two hours ago, OK. Has a pain been constant since?"
32,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it's, it's really excruciating."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, does anything make it better or worse?"
32,MSK,patient,"No, it's I'm just in extreme pain. Like I I I can't even put any weight on it."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you can't, OK so you can't weight bear, and you can't walk on on that leg I guess."
32,MSK,patient,Mhmm.
32,MSK,doctor,OK. Is it a sharp kind of pain or is it dull and achy?
32,MSK,patient,"It's uh, it's pretty sharp, like if I'm not putting any weight on it right now, it's like really achy. But if I put any weight on, it's really sharp."
32,MSK,doctor,OK. And where is this pain exactly? Is it just in your right hip or is it radiating up into your upper anterior lower back or down to your leg?
32,MSK,patient,"It's in the right hip, mostly just on the side, but the pain is kind of like, all over the right side of my groin and I feel like there's some swelling there as well."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK. And one to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever. How bad is your pain?"
32,MSK,patient,"I would say 10, like I've never experienced pain like this."

32,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, not that I can tell, no."
32,MSK,doctor,Dizziness or fainting spells?
32,MSK,patient,"Uhm, after the fall out like this, I I don't know if it's due to the pain, but even in the ambulance, coming out of the ambulance I was feeling a little bit dizzy, but I don't know if that's just 'cause of the pain."

32,MSK,doctor,"OK. And have you been in touch with any, anyone sick recently?"
32,MSK,patient,"Uh. No, I've I've been like at home with my husband. We haven't really left."
32,MSK,doctor,OK. And have you done any travel recently?
32,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, I've just stayed at home."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. So if you can, I'm going to get you to take a look at both your hips as well as your legs. Do you notice any redness or swelling in the area?"
32,MSK,patient,I do notice some swelling. It's a little bit red. I can't really see too much red.
32,MSK,doctor,OK. OK. Any muscle atrophy? Any deformities or skin changes like bruises?
32,MSK,patient,"Uh, maybe some bruising, but I, I don't notice anything else."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright. And then when you place the back of your hand on both hips, do you notice any temperature changes? Is one side warmer than the other?"
32,MSK,patient,"It's a little bit warmer, the right side than the left."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does one like appear to be shorter? Or does does it appear to be misaligned? Or in any sort of like strange positions like outward turning of your leg, one compared to the other?"
32,MSK,patient,"I think it's a bit, but look at it a bit, like outward turning. And then yeah, I would say it's more outward turns."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, and if are you sitting down right now?"
32,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, are you able to stand up from a sitting position?"
32,MSK,patient,"I can try, but it's very painful."
32,MSK,doctor,OK.
32,MSK,patient,"Yes, should I go ahead and try?"
32,MSK,doctor,Yes please.
32,MSK,patient,"Yeah. So I yeah I can barely stand up. I can't, it's kind of just, I'm just supporting myself with my left like."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK and so I, I guess you can't do any of the like hip flexion or hip extension, hip abduction or addduction, correct?"
32,MSK,patient,"No, I can barely move it."
32,MSK,doctor,OK alright those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?
32,MSK,patient,"No, I think I I just don't know if I need surgery or something."
32,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so it sounds like you have a hip fracture from your fall. Uhm, so, the way to treat this is a combination of surgeries and rehab and medication. So we will definitely look into the surgical option first, which is done using some internal repair with screws. Or, you can do a total hip replacement or a partial hip replacement. The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area. Uhm, and for management of pain, you can take ibuprofen or any over the counter pain medications for now. Does that sound OK?"
32,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
32,MSK,doctor,"OK, great, no problem."
33,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?
33,MSK,patient,"I've just been having uh, this pain in my um right, right elbow, and it's just been getting worse over the last few days. I started having it around three days ago. Um, and it's just been getting worse with any kind of gripping motion or, yeah, so it's, it's been getting worse."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, so you said it started three days ago. Um, has it been persistent since, or has it been like on and off?"
33,MSK,patient,"It's been pretty persistent, um, but it's mainly when I'm uh, doing some activities or lifting anything. Um, and yes, I've just been trying to rest it mostly."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, okay, that's good. And um, you said it's worse with activity and better with rest. Have you tried anything else for it?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, I've tried some Advil, it, it seemed to help a little bit, but uh, it just comes back."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's sharp, burning, throbbing, achy?"
33,MSK,patient,"It's more um, like if I don't extend my wrist, it's kind of like achy, but then if I extend my wrist, I feel like a sharp pain at um, on the um, just on the outside of my elbow."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright. Um alright, and then um, in terms of severity, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is the pain?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, probably like a 6 or 7."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Alright, um, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?"
33,MSK,patient,"No, I, I, I've never experienced any kind of pain there at least."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, how about um, in terms of like timeline, is it getting worse?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, just over the past three days, I feel like it's, I have tried not to use it that much. Uh, like when I was at work, I have to use like tools a lot um, and I noticed that when I was using a screwdriver, like it, it hurt a lot. So it hasn't been getting worse, but if I try to do anything at work, it definitely hurts a lot more."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um, alright. And then have you noticed any numbness or tingling?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, no, no, nothing like that."
33,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. How about um, pain elsewhere on your body?"
33,MSK,patient,"Sorry, what was that?"
33,MSK,doctor,Pain elsewhere on your body?
33,MSK,patient,"Oh no, no pain elsewhere."

33,MSK,patient,"Okay. Um, so like, with movement?"

33,MSK,doctor,"Nothing. How about when you um, press down on your like, forearm extensor muscle group?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, just, yeah, so just on the outside of my forearm, close to where the elbow pain is, if I go down a little bit and press down, it does definitely feel sore."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and then how about with your forearm uh, flexor, flexors."
33,MSK,patient,"So on the inside, um, not so much, no."
33,MSK,doctor,"No, okay. And now I'm gonna get you to walk through some movements with me. Um, can you uh, get a piece of paper and, actually can you get a pencil and grip it as tight as you can. Um, do you find that you feel weak when you do that?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, not weak, but it does definitely like um, when I picked up the pencil and moved my wrist up, it did, it did uh, cause some, some pain."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright. So would you mind extending or like straightening out your elbow all the way and then also straightening out your wrists. Um, does that hurt?"
33,MSK,patient,"Uh, straightening out, no, it doesn't hurt."
33,MSK,doctor,"Even with uh, like the wrist um, straightened out?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, yeah if I, if I completely straighten out my wrist uh, then like I just feel a bit of uh, soreness, but not as much pain as when I, um, am lifting something with my wrist or just raising my wrist upwards."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Okay, how about when you flex your wrist all the way?"
33,MSK,patient,"Um, that hurts a little bit, but not nearly as much as when I extend it."
33,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Okay, um, those are all the questions I had for you today, and did you have any questions of your own for myself?"
33,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah, I was just wondering what this, this might be."
33,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so um, it sounds like you have something called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis. Um, and it's usually related to some overuse, um, injury, so whether at work, or if you play a lot of tennis or some sort of sport, that um, overuses a certain muscle group, um, particularly like the forearm extensors. Um, and so basically for this, um, we suggest a few things. We'll start with like some conservative management, like activity modification. So at work, if you're doing repetitive movements, maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks, you can try some like ibuprofen, we'll refer you to some um, physiotherapy to help build those muscles around that, that area. And if those still do, don't work, um, we can try some um, other things like operative um, operative management, but we'll, we'll come back to that in about 6 to 12 months, um, once we uh, we try all of the other stuff. Does that sound okay?"
33,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
33,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, no worries."
34,RES,doctor,"Hi there, I was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but I was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today."
34,RES,patient,I am just calling about my daughter. She's been sick over the last few days. She has fever and a cough.
34,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. When did the fever and cough start?"
34,RES,patient,So they started around three to four days ago. And around the same time she was also having like a runny nose.
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and has the fever and cough been present the whole time?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah I would say they started around the same time and ah, they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh no, every time I've measured it, she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days. Hasn't really changed."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same?"
34,RES,patient,"I would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like, especially today, but the cough, coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago."
34,RES,doctor,OK. Has she been sick like this before?
34,RES,patient,"She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was"
34,RES,doctor,"OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days?"
34,RES,patient,"Not anything that I know of. Her fevers been getting worse, but I don't really know why that is."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, has she been having any other symptoms?"
34,RES,patient,"Um, other than like, yeah, she had that runny nose when it first started, and then she's also been having some diarrhea."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the diarrhea start?"
34,RES,patient,"I think I would say it started around two days ago. She's, like every time I change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day, and they they seem pretty liquid. So I"
34,RES,doctor,"OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour?"
34,RES,patient,"Consistency, I'd say it's pretty watery, like diarrhea and colour I didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour."
34,RES,doctor,OK. So you didn't think there was any blood in the stool?
34,RES,patient,"No, no, no, I didn't see any blood."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, as for the fever, what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it?"
34,RES,patient,"So I used, we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees Fahrenheit."
34,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear?"
34,RES,patient,"No, no, she doesn't seem to have any irritation there."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, how about any vomiting or regurgitation?"
34,RES,patient,"No, she's been keeping food down. No issues there."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and notice any discharge from either eye?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
34,RES,doctor,How about any discharge from ears?
34,RES,patient,"Not that I've noticed, no."
34,RES,doctor,Notice any rashes?
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I didn't not know like new rashes, no."
34,RES,doctor,OK and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour?
34,RES,patient,"Oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days. She's been crying a lot more, just very irritable."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, would you say inconsolable at times?"
34,RES,patient,"Sometimes like yesterday like she, I couldn't get her to stop crying."
34,RES,doctor,"OK and uh, I know you said no vomiting, but has she been coughing up any sputum?"
34,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say, uh, this green slimy content. Yeah, it's like green and slimy."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, um, how much would you say, uhm, like a cup, or more?"
34,RES,patient,"I would say probably like at least, at least a couple spoonfuls at a time, she would cough up."

34,RES,patient,"No, I didn't notice any blood at all."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and with the cough, have you noticed any difficulties breathing?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, I don't know if it's difficulty breathing, but I have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal, like taking a lot more breaths."
34,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. Uh, is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no. I haven't noticed that."

34,RES,patient,"Uh, no, like she's not wheezing or anything."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing."
34,RES,patient,"Uh so like, uhm, like what do you mean by that?"
34,RES,doctor,Like just so when she's breathing in and out. Is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs.
34,RES,patient,"Uh no, I I don't think I've noticed that, no."
34,RES,doctor,"OK. And, and, have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
34,RES,doctor,"OK, and any urinary problems?"
34,RES,patient,"Uh, no, she's peeing fine."
34,RES,doctor,OK. And how has she been sleeping the last few days?

34,RES,patient,"Uh no, not that I've noticed."
34,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all?"

34,RES,doctor,"OK. And uh, is she drinking yeah, a lot more fluids or or a lot less? How is she tolerating oral intake?"

34,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. And, uh, how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours?"
34,RES,patient,"Um? Yeah, it's difficult to say. I think I like yesterday changed four to five times. They were all diarrhea, so not really sure, but maybe around 5."

35,RES,patient,"Uh no, I think you asked me all those other questions, I'm just wondering what do you like, what do you think I have?"
35,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly, uh, so it could possibly be something related to the heart. I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And and sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done."
35,RES,patient,"Ok, ok well thank you very much."
35,RES,doctor,Now you're very welcome. We'll get the investigations started now.
35,RES,patient,"Sure, sounds good."
36,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
36,RES,patient,"So I've just I had some sinus problems in the past. I've had some sinus infections and I just feel like I have one right now and I know that like I know that you know, a lot of the time I I've done all the things that I've been told to do in the past like I've been doing, like Saline rinses and just doesn't feel like it's helping very much right now. When I rinse, I'm getting like this greenie gross kind of mucus coming out. And it's just like giving me this like headache. It just feels crappy."

36,RES,patient,"So my thermometer said that's high, I don't, I don't really know, but yeah."
36,RES,doctor,"OK and how about like, facial pain or pressure or feeling like it's full?"
36,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I have that. It's like yeah, all on the front part of my face."
36,RES,doctor,"OK. And then you mentioned some nasal obstruction, some discharge and you said no loss of smell, right?"

36,RES,patient,"No, this is pretty well, pretty well the only thing. I had some problems with my knee like I had some problems with the ACL, so like I see like an orthopaedic person for that, but otherwise, otherwise I'm healthy."
36,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?"
36,RES,patient,"No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse."
36,RES,doctor,OK.
36,RES,patient,"For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore."
36,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?"
36,RES,patient,"Uh, so I had an ACL repair surgery."
36,RES,doctor,"Oh right, yeah, OK."
36,RES,patient,"And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. How about immunizations? Are you up to date?"
36,RES,patient,I think so. I never really didn't get any.
36,RES,doctor,OK. Any allergies?
36,RES,patient,"Uh, like a little bit to cats but nothing else."
36,RES,doctor,OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?
36,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of."
36,RES,doctor,"OK. How about smoking, do you smoke?"
36,RES,patient,"No, no."
36,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?"
36,RES,patient,I drink a few beers on the weekend.
36,RES,doctor,OK.
36,RES,patient,You know five or six per weekend.
36,RES,doctor,"OK. And then, five or six for weekend. OK and any recreational drugs?"
36,RES,patient,"I will occasionally take like a cannabis, like a capsule like the oil in the capsule."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, and what is that for?"
36,RES,patient,"Just like recreational. Also like I mean my knee, my knee pain. Sometimes it helps."
36,RES,doctor,"Mhmm, OK."
36,RES,patient,But essentially that that might be like once like per month or something.
36,RES,doctor,"OK. OK. Alright, and, any sick contacts recently?"
36,RES,patient,"No, no. I've been working from home."
36,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and any travel recently?"
36,RES,patient,No.
36,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And where do you live?"
36,RES,patient,I live here in town with my wife and our teenage son.
36,RES,doctor,OK. Is anyone at home sick?
36,RES,patient,"No, they're fine."
36,RES,doctor,"They're fine. OK, and what about.. Sorry?"
36,RES,patient,They're both working from home like doing school from home too. So we rarely don't go anywhere like my wife goes to get groceries and that's about it.
36,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold anything like that at home?"
36,RES,patient,"No, no, it's a pretty new house."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, any pets at home?"
36,RES,patient,We have a dog. It's a labradoodle.
36,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah."
36,RES,patient,"And that's it, yeah."
36,RES,doctor,How long have you had him?
36,RES,patient,"Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
36,RES,patient,"I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you."
36,RES,doctor,"Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?"
36,RES,patient,"So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?"
36,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you."
36,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah no problem."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, what brings you in today?"
37,RES,patient,"Hi, I just came in uh, I just had this sudden, just this morning after I woke up, this sudden shortness of breath and like each time I take a deep breath I'm getting this chest pain."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, and this just started this morning, you said?"
37,RES,patient,Yeah.
37,RES,doctor,Were you absolutely fine last night?
37,RES,patient,"Yeah, I didn't have any trouble last night."
37,RES,doctor,"I see, I see, okay. Um, any other, does the chest pain only occur when you're taking a deep breath in?"
37,RES,patient,"Yeah, mainly it's during that time."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, have you had any other symptoms such as a headache or cough, or runny nose, congestion, sore throat?"
37,RES,patient,"Um, no. No, nothing like that."
37,RES,doctor,And changes in your bowel movement? Any pain in your belly?
37,RES,patient,No.
37,RES,doctor,Any urinary symptoms?
37,RES,patient,No.
37,RES,doctor,"Any um, any pain in your legs?"
37,RES,patient,"Um, I did notice last, last night and for the last few days that my right calf like, just feels um, painful and it seems a bit more swollen."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, was there anything that you were doing a couple of days ago? Any, say, any flights or periods um, where you might be sitting still or lying still for awhile? Any surgeries, anything like that?"
37,RES,patient,"I was, I was just discharged from the hospital um, last week after a hip surgery."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, okay. Were you moving around at home after the hip surgery?"
37,RES,patient,"Um not, not really. Like I was, I was told I should move around a bit, but it's been quite hard."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, alright, and do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
37,RES,patient,"Yes, I have uh, high blood pressure, and um, I also have this thing like, like varicose veins."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, do you take any medications?"
37,RES,patient,"I, I take this medication called um, lisinopril."
37,RES,doctor,And any new medications that were started after your hospital stay?
37,RES,patient,"Um, no, they gave me like some pain medications I seem to, uh, um I got hydromorphone medication. I've been trying to stay away from it though, just taking Tylenol instead."
37,RES,doctor,Is your pain controlled well with Tylenol?
37,RES,patient,"Yeah, I tried to suck it up. I just don't wanna go on those other medications. I've heard like, you can get addicted to them."
37,RES,doctor,"Yeah, that's fair, that's a fair point. But it's also, I guess it's important that you move around at home. Um, so maybe try to, maybe we can increase your Tylenol dose, or maybe um, see if there's another pain med that you can be started on if you're not interested in opioids, just to make sure that you're moving around 'cause that's very important. At the hospital, did you receive an injection in your, in your tummy."
37,RES,patient,"An injection in my tummy, um."
37,RES,doctor,"Every day, once a day?"
37,RES,patient,"I think so, yeah I did."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Um, alright. And do you have any allergies?"
37,RES,patient,"Uh, no allergies."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and who do you live with?"
37,RES,patient,"I live alone. Yeah, right now I live alone in an apartment."
37,RES,doctor,Were you discharged with any support?
37,RES,patient,"Yeah, I do have a nurse coming in, like every, everyday, but I don't, they, they didn't come like yesterday."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Um, and do you smoke, or did you ever smoke in the past?"
37,RES,patient,"I used to smoke in, probably in my 20s and 30s, but then I stopped when I had kids and stuff."
37,RES,doctor,Do you drink alcohol?
37,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, probably uh, a glass, once or twice um, every couple days."
37,RES,doctor,"Um, and sorry. just going back, how much did you smoke in your 20s and 30s and for how many years?"
37,RES,patient,"Probably smoked for, probably, 15, 15 years, probably like, like half a pack a day."
37,RES,doctor,"Alright um, and do you consume any marijuana or any recreational drugs?"
37,RES,patient,No.
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, alright. Well given your symptoms, um, with the, with the swelling and the pain in the right calf and the difficulties breathing, it's very likely that you have um, and your recent hospitalization and hip injury, um it sounds like you might have something called, or pulmonary embolism, basically, which is a blood clot inside your lungs, and so we'll do a scan of your lungs to see what's going on. We'll also do an ultrasound of your leg, and then um, we might have to treat, uh, this with blood thinners. And we definitely have to hospitalize you, and we'll be measuring your vitals and seeing if you need any oxygen to help you out."
37,RES,patient,"Okay, I'll be, I'll be here for a while then?"
37,RES,doctor,"Well, we'll keep you for a bit, at least the next couple of days until your, your breathing gets better. And you've, you've been started on anti, on blood thinners."
37,RES,patient,Okay.
37,RES,doctor,"And we can be sure that you're, you're doing okay, we'll also continuously monitor your vital signs um, to make sure that you're doing well, and then we'll make sure that you're discharged. We will also get you some physiotherapy here while in the hospital to help you um, mobilize better when you get home. Um, and we'll also do a COVID swab just in case. Did you have any exposures to anyone in the past couple of days before you came, at home, after you came home?"
37,RES,patient,"No, I've been just at home, just the nurse."
37,RES,doctor,"I see, I see. Okay, well, we'll do a COVID swab just in case and go from there. Do you have any questions?"
37,RES,patient,"No um, yeah, that, that sounds good."
37,RES,doctor,"Okay, great."

38,GAS,patient,It's mostly up here on the right side.
38,GAS,doctor,"The right side, OK and can you describe what kind of pain is it? Is it like a dull pain or sharp pain, an aching pain?"
38,GAS,patient,"Oh I guess it's a, it's an aching pain I'd say. It kind of just, um, it would initially just come and go, but now it's just it's staying. It's not going away."
38,GAS,doctor,"OK, and so it's in the right area and does it travel anywhere elsewhere besides on from the right side?"
38,GAS,patient,No.
38,GAS,doctor,"OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, one being the least amount of pain you felt in your life, and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it right now?"
38,GAS,patient,"It's about to a 10, an 8 maybe."
38,GAS,doctor,"An 8, OK and so just to clarify, when did it start?"
38,GAS,patient,About 8 hours ago.
38,GAS,doctor,"8 hours ago, OK. And were you doing anything before? Like, did you have a meal or how were you sleeping before it woke you up, what was going on before you had the pain?"
38,GAS,patient,I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in particular at the time.
38,GAS,doctor,OK. And has it been getting worse since it first started?
38,GAS,patient,"Oh yeah, definitely it would come and go, but now for the past I'd say five to six hours, it's been constant, just there all the time."
38,GAS,doctor,OK. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past?
38,GAS,patient,"Yeah, uh I I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't I don't know what's going on now."
38,GAS,doctor,"OK, and does it, does anything make it better or worse or anything that you've tried?"
38,GAS,patient,"Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse, um, but I don't I don't think there's anything that's making it better."

40,RES,patient,"Uh, no, that was kind of it. What should I do for him?"
40,RES,doctor,"Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night."
40,RES,patient,OK.
40,RES,doctor,"But umm, that's about it."
40,RES,patient,OK.
40,RES,doctor,"We'll, so, we'll so we'll just observe for now."

43,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Uhm so, we are going to do a Covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of Covid, so we just want to rule that out first, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm, in the meantime you should isolate for two weeks and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's been going around this time of year. Either way, kind of management plan is the same, so make sure you're hydrated, eat well, sleep well, and if your symptoms become worse, severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms, like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"

44,RES,patient,"No, I I I just wanted to figure out what this was."
44,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, so it sounds or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of Covid. Umm, you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?"
44,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
44,RES,doctor,Yeah no problem.
45,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
45,RES,patient,"Hi, um my son has just been sick over the past uh couple of days. He's just had this cough and uh stuffy nose and uhm, yeah. He's also had this uh rash that just started."

45,RES,patient,"Yeah, so the cough started about a week ago and um his stuffy nose, he's sort of had a stuffy nose since around the same time and then um, those symptoms um so it continued and got a little bit better over the past few days and then he started um having this rash on his face that then kind of went down to his neck."
45,RES,doctor,"OK, and is the rash still uh there right now?"

That reminds me, yeah, he was out playing with other children, were any other kids experiencing similar symptoms?"
45,RES,patient,Um I'm not sure I I guess I need to talk to their their parents now.

We may want to have blood work done, maybe some other tests based on what we find out from there and then we can kind of let you know after that, what the next steps will be. So I'm just going to take this and go over it with the physician that I'm working with and will get back to you shortly. Thanks for chatting with me."
46,GAS,patient,Thanks doc.
47,RES,doctor,What can I do for you today?
47,RES,patient,"Hi, yes, I just brought my son to the ER. We've noticed in the last two days he's been just making these grunting noises and just seems a little bit like just not himself, just more quiet. Not really crying."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did you, you said last few days, when when exactly did you first notice the grunting? How long?"
47,RES,patient,It was two days ago.
47,RES,doctor,"OK, two days ago. Was it when, did you hear this sound when your baby is trying to breathe?"
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, today I was trying to pay more attention. It seems like that like this really trying to breathe more. And also I like he's like the chest I see moving a lot more."
47,RES,doctor,"OK. And so you've been hearing this grunting sound, and he's been trying to breathe. And you see that his chest is moving more than usual and he's crying. Has he been sleeping well or no?"
47,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, so last night it was really hard to get him to sleep. He did sleep, I would say like around like 4 hours last night, but it was really difficult."
47,RES,doctor,And what about feeding? Does he take a formula or is he breastfed?
47,RES,patient,"So he's, uh, he takes formula and today it like yesterday he was feeding. Today it's been really hard to get him to feed. Maybe he fed for like one or two times, but not much."
47,RES,doctor,It happens when you try to feed him?
47,RES,patient,"Uhm, Kind of just uh after awhile, just pushes it away, not really, uhm, yeah, uhm not really too excited about feeding."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, and what about diapers? How many wet diapers has he had over the past, or yesterday and today?"
47,RES,patient,Probably around the same like usually has like five to six weight diapers and it's around the same.
47,RES,doctor,OK. OK. Uhm and did you try anything? I know that he's six months old. Did you try feeding him anything new or anything different?
47,RES,patient,"Uh, no, it's just been the bottle feeds."
47,RES,doctor,Nothing new right? No solid foods yet?
47,RES,patient,No.
47,RES,doctor,"OK. And uh in terms of his activities, you mentioned that he's not as he's not moving and, as active as he usually is?"
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, today I also thought I felt that it was a bit warm, warmer than usual, but I didn't have a thermometer at home."
47,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm have you noticed, has he been drooling at all?"
47,RES,patient,Drooling?
47,RES,doctor,Mhmm.
47,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed that."
47,RES,doctor,OK. What about coughing?
47,RES,patient,"Uhm, I haven't heard any, any coughing, no."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, Sorry, is he is able to sit up on his own?"
47,RES,patient,"Uhm, up against like a sofa or chair, but not really on his own."
47,RES,doctor,Have you ever been has been left alone over the past two days at some point? Do you feel like you might have taken something in his mouth accidentally?
47,RES,patient,Uhm no I I tried checking his mouth like I was there with him like all all the time.
47,RES,doctor,"No, OK nothing like that? OK, how has his immunizations been so far? Has he as he received them?"
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, he's received all his immunizations, up to date."
47,RES,doctor,"Uhm, did he have, it has he was vaccinated anytime recently? Because sometimes you said he's warm and sometimes, sometimes just getting vaccinated can cause a reaction."
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, no. He was vaccinated like I think more than two or three weeks ago."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. And you said no diarrhea or anything like that, right?"
47,RES,patient,No.
47,RES,doctor,"OK, any, is he does he have any nausea or not nausea but is he vomiting? Is he bringing anything up?"
47,RES,patient,"No, not really. Like he was just pushing away the bottle. But like he didn't bring anything up."
47,RES,doctor,OK. Has he been limp and lethargic?
47,RES,patient,"Uhm no, I don't think so."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, has you said that he hasn't had his formula much? But what about drinking? Like has he had anything to drink? Any milk or anything like that, or no?"
47,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."
47,RES,doctor,"No, she hasn't had much to eat and or drink over the past or today?"
47,RES,patient,Yeah mostly.
47,RES,doctor,So he might be a little bit dehydrated.
47,RES,patient,Yeah.
47,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, OK, well uhm, I, I, OK, so that's all I wanted to do know in terms of his current status, I would obviously want to examine him very carefully and see what's going on. Uhm, how has uh, how is he like just going back, how was your pregnancy?"
47,RES,patient,"Pregnancy was uh, OK, no complications, but he was premature by two weeks, so I think he was born at 35 and four days."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, and were there any complications at that time, including complications related to the lung, something like respiratory distress syndrome?"
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, so when he was born there was they needed to do, I forgot what it was, but they told me that initially he wasn't breathing, but then right afterwards after like within 5 minutes, he was fine."
47,RES,doctor,"Hmm, uhm, OK, uhm, was he kept in the hospital in the NICU after being born?"
47,RES,patient,"Yeah, just because of that scare, they kept him for three more days, but like he was growing while there were no more episodes of the breathing issue, so they let him go after."
47,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, has, how has he been since then over the past six months?"
47,RES,patient,"Since then, he's been fine. No, we didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, and during our routine visits he's been growing well, no normal issues."
47,RES,doctor,Any issues because development?
47,RES,patient,"No, he's been pretty, like he's been meeting his milestones according to like the family doctor."
47,RES,doctor,"Has he had any surgeries or any, or no hospitalizations you said, and no, uhm no diagnosis, right? He hasn't been diagnosed with any condition?"
47,RES,patient,No.
47,RES,doctor,Alright. Can you tell me about allergies? Is he allergic to anything that you're aware of?
47,RES,patient,"No, not that I know."
47,RES,doctor,"OK, is there uh, can you tell me about his family history? Anything that you might have or uhm his dad or anyone else in the family?"
47,RES,patient,"Uh, no, him, his dad and I are pretty healthy, yeah. No medical conditions."
47,RES,doctor,Anything like cystic fibrosis in the family?
47,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of."
47,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, well we'll examine the child and look at his vitals, listen to his lungs, look, look inside his mouth and that's this sounds serious, so we'll keep you, we'll keep you updated and we'll let you know what needs to be done. He might need, potentially need antibiotics. He might need potentially, to be intubated, but we will have all these discussions after the baby's been seen and we'll draw some labs and go from there."
47,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
47,RES,doctor,Alright.
47,RES,patient,Thank you.
48,RES,patient,I've just been having this this cough over the last few days and I also notice that I'm getting like these headaches and chills as well at night. So I was just a bit concerned.
48,RES,doctor,"OK, so the cough started a few days ago. Have you been bringing up any phlegm?"
48,RES,patient,"No, not really. It's been pretty much like a dry cough. I did feel like a tickle in my throat before it started, but no, I'm not producing any phlegm."
48,RES,doctor,"OK, um is the cough any worse at any particular time of day, like when you first get up or or at night when going to bed?"

48,RES,patient,"Just like Tylenol cold. And then I think there was another over the counter medication that I took, but nothing really helping."
48,RES,doctor,"OK and uh, the cough has been been getting worse. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
48,RES,patient,"Um, I did just just last night, actually. I thought that I had some shortness of breath as well. I don't know if that's being caused by all the coughing, but yeah, I got pretty scared, so that's why I'm here today."

And so it could be COVID, or this could be another viral infection or possibly pneumonia going on. But it does sound like you have an infection and so we'll check some sputum cultures. And and we'll also do a PCR nasal swab testing for COVID. So we'll go ahead and order those tests and we'll see what their their results say."
48,RES,patient,"Alright, sounds good."

49,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, I don't see anything like that."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, and if you touch the joints around the wrist on both sides, is the right wrist, does it feel hot?"
49,MSK,patient,"No, actually. Yes it does."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, and but there's no swelling there."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you noticing any muscle atrophy or or any deformity at the wrist?"
49,MSK,patient,"Uh, I guess there's like a slight bruise."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are there any like raised bumps if you put your finger over it over the bony edges?"
49,MSK,patient,Uhm no bumps but just a general kind of swelling in the area that makes it look raised.
49,MSK,doctor,"Alright, and and if you palpate or press on some areas of the wrist are there any areas that you're feeling pain like at the distal radial head, the distal ulna, uh or any areas of the wrist?"
49,MSK,patient,Uhm there's some pain at the distal radius for sure.
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh, alright and is this on the back of the hand or the that the palm side."
49,MSK,patient,It's on the palm side.
49,MSK,doctor,"OK. Do you feel any pain if you push in the what's called the anatomical stuff box, so it's at the base of the thumb um on yeah, the base of the thumb on the back of your hand?"
49,MSK,patient,"Base of the thumb, um no, I don't feel any pain there."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK. And. OK, so no pain at the the dorsal anatomical snuffbox and in terms of range of motion are you able to flex and extend your wrist?"
49,MSK,patient,I am.
49,MSK,doctor,"OK and then how about move it like side to side, kind of deviating it?"
49,MSK,patient,"Uhm I can do all of these things, it just hurts a lot."
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, are you able to make a fist?"
49,MSK,patient,Yes.
49,MSK,doctor,"Alright, and do you have any problems at the elbow or are you able to flex and extend the elbow OK?"
49,MSK,patient,I can flex and extend OK.
49,MSK,doctor,"OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to check today. Did you have any questions or concerns?"
49,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, just do I need any sort of surgery for this, and do I need an X Ray? How do I go about trying to treat this?"
49,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so I think I it, X-Ray would be the first step here because from what you're describing, and particularly with the mechanism of the injury and where you're feeling pain can be a common cause of a distal radial radial fracture which is one of the forearm bones. And so yeah, we will need an X-Ray to look to see if there is a distal radial fracture. And it's not sounding like this right now, but another thing that will look for on on the X Ray of the hands too is a scaphoid fracture to make sure that that's OK, but you didn't have any pain in the area of the scaphoid, which is reassuring, but we still want to image and make sure, although that most likely thing would be the distal radial fracture an if that's the case, then there will be like we will have to go into a cast for a period of time. And depending on how much joint involvement there is, there might be the possibility of surgery, but cannot comment too much on on that just yet. We will need to get the imaging first."
49,MSK,patient,"OK, OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
50,MSK,doctor,What can I do for you?
50,MSK,patient,"Hi there, yeah I've had this pain in my knee that's been going on for a few weeks now and it hasn't gone away and and so I thought I would get checked out. It's been really impacting my running. I just haven't been able to run as often as I would like to and so that's why I wanted to get this looked at."
50,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. You said it started a couple of weeks ago. Was that two weeks ago, three weeks ago? Or more than that?"
50,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I would say maybe it's been going on for the past four weeks, for the past month."
50,MSK,doctor,Past month. OK. And is it a constant type of pain or does it come and go?
50,MSK,patient,"It comes and goes, yeah, and it depends on what I'm doing."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uhm, alright and what kind of makes it worse or better?"
50,MSK,patient,"So if I'm out while running, what will bug it, but I think like that the main things that hurt are if I'm walking down stairs or if if I'm squatting. I like to lift weights as well, and yeah, I could barely even do body weight now 'cause if I I'm squatting down it causes a lot of pain, it's a sharp pain."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your pain, would you say it's achy, throbbing, dull, sharp, burning?"
50,MSK,patient,"Uh, it's a sharp pain."
50,MSK,doctor,"Sharp pain, OK. And one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had. How bad is this pain?"
50,MSK,patient,It's about a 7.
50,MSK,doctor,7. And have you ever had pain like this in the past?
50,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, I haven't."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you feel like your pains getting worse over the past four weeks?"
50,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah it has gotten, has gotten a bit worse."

50,MSK,patient,"It's on the anterior aspect. Like on the front of it, but I I could, it feels like the pain is right behind my like right underneath the kneecap."
50,MSK,doctor,"Right underneath the knee, OK."

50,MSK,patient,No.
50,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Alright, and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
50,MSK,patient,"I do have, ah, asthma, so I I do take a, an inhaler. I have a daily, a daily one that I'll use and then, just a, like rescue one. So like the blue one that I'll use sometimes, but I haven't needed that one for for awhile. I've been pretty good. I don't even need it when I'm going or runs anymore."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK that's good. And are you on any medications?"
50,MSK,patient,"Yeah, just the just the inhalers and then I took uh, birth control as well. I've been taking that since I was 16 so, yeah, so for like 6 years? 7 years?"

50,MSK,doctor,"OK, And, and do you smoke?"
50,MSK,patient,"No, I I try to stay away from that with all the running and stuff that I'm doing. I'm uh, I want to make sure that I'm able to to improve."
50,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. And how about marijuana? Do you consume that in any form?"
50,MSK,patient,"No, I don't."
50,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, and how about recreational drugs?"

50,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and travel anywhere?"
50,MSK,patient,"No, we've been at, been at home."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, uhm, alright, so I think those are all the questions that I have for you. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview, if that's OK with you. So I'm going to get you to take a look at both your knees and let me know if you see more redness or swelling in your left knee compared to your right."
50,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, I'm not noticing any swelling."
50,MSK,doctor,Do you see any redness?
50,MSK,patient,"No, no redness."
50,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes in your left knee compared to your right knee?"
50,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
50,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. I'm gonna get you to press down and palpate on your quadriceps on both knee. Sorry, on both thighs. Do you feel any pain there?"
50,MSK,patient,"Uh, no pain there."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about when you press down on your knee caps?"
50,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I do get some pain when I push on the on the kneecap, uhm, on my left knee."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about just below that where your shins start?"
50,MSK,patient,No pain there.
50,MSK,doctor,"No pain there, and then how about on the lateral aspects of your knee?"
50,MSK,patient,"Ah, no pain there."
50,MSK,doctor,And then the medial aspects of your knee?
50,MSK,patient,No pain there.
50,MSK,doctor,"No pain there. OK, good. When you are palpating, was there a difference in temperature between the left and right knee? Was the left knee a little bit more warm than the right knee?"
50,MSK,patient,"No, the temperature feels the same."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, good. So now I'm going to uhm, are you sitting down?"
50,MSK,patient,I am yes.
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, so from a sitting position I'm going to get you to stand up uhm, and you let me know if that is painful."
50,MSK,patient,"It is, yeah."
50,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, OK. Uhm, and then how about when you bend your knees?"
50,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, no pain with just bending."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about when you, uh, when you flex your hips so you can do one leg at a time, does that hurt?"
50,MSK,patient,"Oh no, that doesn't hurt."
50,MSK,doctor,OK. And how about squatting down?
50,MSK,patient,"That does hurt. Yeah, squatting hurts."
50,MSK,doctor,Squatting hurts OK. OK and then how about when you point your toes towards the ceiling?
50,MSK,patient,No pain.
50,MSK,doctor,OK. How about when you point your toes towards the ground?
50,MSK,patient,No pain.
50,MSK,doctor,"No pain. So no pain on dorsiflexion or planter flexion, OK. Do you hear any like popping or crackling sounds in your knees when you climb stairs or when you're standing up after sitting down for a long time?"
50,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah, sometimes I will hear, uhm, some, some like yeah, crackling sounds."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright and yeah, you mentioned that you do a lot of running. Do you do any other sorts of exercises?"
50,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I'll do some weight lifting and like cycling as well. I mean, all kinds of different stuff. We just, like staying as active as I can."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright yeah, given your young age and the fact that you do a lot of running and a lot of physical activity like cycling and lifting weights, what you have is most likely something called a Patellofemoral syndrome and that is basically a nerve. Uh kind of pain and then in the in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good. So, in the meantime, while you while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method and so that stands for resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance. But of those non surgical treatments work we'll also refer you to like am arthroscopy or some sort of surgery that may be able to fix the issue more permanently. Does that sound OK?"
50,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, thank you."
50,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, no worries."
51,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
51,MSK,patient,"So I've just been having this pain in my knee since I um just fell, uh, just three days ago slipping on the stairs. Since then I've been having a lot of pain."
51,MSK,doctor,I see uh so did this pain start right after like falling on the stairs?
51,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I've been having the pain since then."

51,MSK,patient,Probably around 6.
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um. And. Did your knee hurt before this at all, or did you have any trauma to the leg before?"
51,MSK,patient,"No, no before 3 days ago before my slip I was fine."

51,MSK,patient,In my calf I'm getting a lot of pain as well. In my right calf.
51,MSK,doctor,"OK, has there been anything that's made the pain worse?"
51,MSK,patient,"Yeah, if I am If I'm walking or if I'm moving that leg and putting weight on it, it's definitely worse, so it's definitely like better if I just stay seated and stay resting."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. Is there anything she said resting that helps, is there anything else that's helped?"
51,MSK,patient,"I did take some Advil which did help for a few hours, but then it just kind of went back to the same."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uhm. And. Yeah, have you had any other, uh, like associated symptoms with the right knee and calf pain?"
51,MSK,patient,"Yes, I also think there's some swelling in my right calf as well. Since yesterday."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, there's some swelling there."

51,MSK,patient,"Uhm, I think I I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you feel, is there any pain to palpation? Like if you touch your calf or something like that is there pain?"
51,MSK,patient,Yeah if I touch my right calf it's painful and then if I press down on it's really painful and then just on the outside of my right knee if I touch or press down it really hurts as well.
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. And if you move your foot so it yeah, if you dorsiflex your ankle. Or bending your your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? Doing the Homan test."
51,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah I'll try that. And yeah, I think it definitely hurts. When I when I move my or point my toes towards my nose."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that that maybe I missed?"
51,MSK,patient,"No, I think that's all."
51,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah alright so with the. I fall 2 days ago. Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK."
51,MSK,patient,OK sounds good. Thank you so much.
52,RES,doctor,Could you start by telling me what brought you in?
52,RES,patient,"So like I don't really feel sick. I just I lost. I can't. I for the past two days I can't smell anything. I can't taste any of my food. It's super weird I like live with my boyfriend and he was like here take a bite of this onion and I like bit into it and I literally didn't taste anything. Otherwise, like I feel totally fine. I just heard that this happens sometimes like with COVID and. I'm just kind of worried that I have COVID."
52,RES,doctor,"OK, for sure I will we will, um definitely look into that today and you are right, it is a symptom that can occur with with covid.

55,RES,doctor,"Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms."
55,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good."
55,RES,doctor,"So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing."
55,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home."
55,RES,doctor,"Perfect. Actually, don't go into the store. Have someone else get it for you, but."
55,RES,patient,OK will do. Thank you.

56,MSK,patient,No.
56,MSK,doctor,OK and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation?
56,MSK,patient,At just the medial part of it like the I guess where the ligament would be.
56,MSK,doctor,"OK, so just let me OK, and, any pain over the patella?"
56,MSK,patient,No.
56,MSK,doctor,Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?

56,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is there any joint yeah, the joint laxity or pain too, like a valgus stress of the knee?"
56,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so when I press when I do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect."
56,MSK,doctor,OK. Uhm and does it feel is as though there's some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress?
56,MSK,patient,"A little bit, yes."

56,MSK,patient,"No, no."
56,MSK,doctor,OK and reflexes are normal.
56,MSK,patient,Mmmm
56,MSK,doctor,OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?
56,MSK,patient,"Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?"
56,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles."
56,MSK,patient,OK.
56,MSK,doctor,"But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving."
56,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds good, thank you."
57,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?
57,MSK,patient,"I've just come in today because I've been having some issues with my hips as well as my knees. Just over the last probably a month or two, I've been just getting, this stiffness and pain especially, uh, throughout the day as the day goes along, and I also experience some stiffness when I wake up in the morning, uh, in my hips and knees, so I just wanted to come and check out what that might be."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, and you said it started in the past month?"
57,MSK,patient,"Yeah, maybe up to two months actually. Yeah, I would say two months."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is the pain and stiffness always there or does it come and go?"
57,MSK,patient,"It's, it comes and goes. It's worse in the, so it's stiff, more stiff in the morning first, but like as the day goes on, probably near the afternoon it gets worse. So I've had to stop some of my activities like gardening and being outdoors and things like that."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK. And you said it's, it gets worse with activity. Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uhm, it probably, yeah, if I'm just exerting myself too much. Uh, in terms of better, I I think I've taken some Advil that does help with the pain."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. And then if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's achy, throbbing, dull, or sharp?"
57,MSK,patient,"It's kind of like this uh, achy pain, kind of deep within the joints themselves."
57,MSK,doctor,OK.
57,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it just gets worse. I, as I walk more and do more activities."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does the pain radiate also or does it, or is it pretty localized to your hips and knees?"
57,MSK,patient,It's mainly in those areas.
57,MSK,doctor,"OK. And severity wise, one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is this pain?"
57,MSK,patient,Probably like a 7.
57,MSK,doctor,"Seven, OK. And have you ever experienced this type of pain before?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,And do you think your pain is getting worse?
57,MSK,patient,"Uhm, I think so. Like over the last two months, I feel like my pain, there's more stiffness, there's more pain throughout the day."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. And yeah, so do you, are you experiencing any sort of numbness or tingling in the areas?"
57,MSK,patient,"No, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Any muscle weakness?"
57,MSK,patient,Nope.
57,MSK,doctor,"No. Are you still able to walk and do the things that you used to enjoy doing? I know you said gardening was hard for you. How about like other activities of like daily living like, uhm, cooking, using the washroom, things like that?"
57,MSK,patient,"Yeah, those things I don't really have too much trouble with."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, that's good at least. And any dizziness or fainting spells?"
57,MSK,patient,No.

57,MSK,doctor,"Uhm how about coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath?"
57,MSK,patient,Nope.
57,MSK,doctor,"Uhm, chest pain, heart palpitations or fainting?"
57,MSK,patient,No.
57,MSK,doctor,Changes in your bowel movements?
57,MSK,patient,Nope.
57,MSK,doctor,"Uh, changes in your urinating?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, no."
57,MSK,doctor,OK. And then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any past medical conditions?
57,MSK,patient,"Uhm, so I do have a prior history of hypertension as well as high cholesterol, diabetes, type 2 diabetes and also a bit more on the overweight side."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, uhm, are you taking any medications for all of this?"
57,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so blood pressure, I'm taking this medication called Telmisartan. And then for blood pressure, I'm taking uh, metformin. Sorry, not blood pressure, for diabetes I'm taking metformin."

57,MSK,patient,Yeah.
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, so we'll take a look at, if you can, if you have a mirror, we'll take a look at both hips first. Do you notice any redness or swelling on those hips?"
57,MSK,patient,"No, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?"
57,MSK,patient,No.
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. And then how about on your knees? Do you see any redness or swelling there?"
57,MSK,patient,"Not really, no."
57,MSK,doctor,"No. Any atrophy, deformity, or skin changes there?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, no."
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. I'm gonna get you to palpate your hipbones. Does that hurt?"
57,MSK,patient,"No, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about when you do that to your knees?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, the knee I can feel a little bit of I would say it's more of a discomfort then tenderness."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, so some discomfort on the patella palpation. Uhm, alright and then when you palpate those areas, do you feel like there is a grading sensation? How, does it feel warm?"
57,MSK,patient,No.
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. And then I'm gonna get you to, can you flex your hips all the way so bend so from a sitting position stand up first? Does it hurt when you extend your hips like that?"
57,MSK,patient,"Not right now. I think, I'm pretty sure my hips are pretty well rested right now, but there is still a little bit of stiffness."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, so some stiffness on hip extension. How about when you bend your hips all the way?"
57,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that's a I can't really go down that far. But yeah, even bending, as much as I can, there is some discomfort there."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, so some discomfort and some pain on hip flexion as well as limited range of motion."
57,MSK,patient,Mhmm.
57,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, and when you do both of those, do you hear any like what's called a crepitus or like a grating sensation where you feel like bone maybe hitting bone?"
57,MSK,patient,"No, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Alright, and I'm going to get you to, uh, extend your knee, so straighten it out. Yeah, does that hurt?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uhm, yeah, a little stiffness in my knees. I feel like I feel more of the grating sound in my knees."
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. And then how about when you bend your knees all the way backwards? You can do one at a time."
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah I, yeah I definitely feel some discomfort there as well."
57,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, OK. Alright, and how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?"
57,MSK,patient,"No, that's fine. I can do that."
57,MSK,doctor,And then how about when you point your toes to the ground?
57,MSK,patient,Yeah no issues.
57,MSK,doctor,"OK, so no pain or limited range of motion with plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. OK, so those were all the test that I want to do with you today. Did you have any questions or concerns?"
57,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, not really."
57,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, uhm, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens, uhm, when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years, and so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes like the grading sensation and causes the pain. Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. Uhm, and another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint. And if these things don't work in the future, we can also discuss things like steroid injections or joint replacement. Does that sound like a good plan?"
57,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, no worries."
58,MSK,doctor,What brings you here today?
58,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I'm so I'm here with my mom because I am having this pain in my right hip and groin area. Um I was playing with my friends too. Maybe yeah, yesterday and I fell down. I didn't fall down hard, but I had a small fall and since then my hip has been hurting and it's painful for me to bear any weight on my right leg."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, and did you have this pain at all before your fall or is this something that just started after the fall?"
58,MSK,patient,It just started after.
58,MSK,doctor,OK and when did you have the fall?
58,MSK,patient,Yesterday.
58,MSK,doctor,OK and can you describe what you were doing and from how high did you fall and if like on what surface you fell on?
58,MSK,patient,"Sure um we were playing soccer on like a field and I and I just fell on the grass, like it was a flat surface."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, and so did you say it was the right hip that's giving you pain?"
58,MSK,patient,"Yes, that's right."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, did you fall on the right hip?"
58,MSK,patient,I did.
58,MSK,doctor,"OK an after you fell were you able to um weight bear like get up, get back up on your feet or was it difficult?"
58,MSK,patient,It was difficult an I'm still limping.
58,MSK,doctor,"OK and you're still limping on. Have you noticed, so any pain anywhere else, or is it just your hip?"
58,MSK,patient,Um just my hip.
58,MSK,doctor,OK and where exactly is your pain on the hip?
58,MSK,patient,It's like on the side of my hip as well as like in the groin area.
58,MSK,doctor,"OK I see, and what kind of pain are you experiencing, is it a sharp pain or is it a dull aching pain?"
58,MSK,patient,It's pretty sharp.
58,MSK,doctor,"It's sharp OK. And do you experience any other symptoms, like any dizziness or fainting spells?"
58,MSK,patient,No.
58,MSK,doctor,"And are you able to move your hip at all, like are you able to flex it, or extend it, rotate it?"
58,MSK,patient,"I can move it, but it comes with a lot of pain."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you find that your hip is at all rotated outwards?"
58,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it looks um. Yeah, it looks like it is."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, have you taken any medications for your pain?"
58,MSK,patient,I just took some ibuprofen.
58,MSK,doctor,"OK. And. Other than that, have you recently been sick at all?"
58,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, and on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've found in your life, how much would you rate this?"
58,MSK,patient,How would say like an 8.
58,MSK,doctor,"An eight, and as the pain travel anywhere, to other parts of your body?"
58,MSK,patient,"No, just stays in that area."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK, any numbness or tingling?"

58,MSK,doctor,"OK, any pain in any other joints?"
58,MSK,patient,No.

58,MSK,patient,"Uhm I'm about 4'8""."
58,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, alright, so yeah those were just some of the questions I had today we'll do a full physical examination and have you come in. Alright, sorry and like well will continue with the full examination today and what currently it seems like it can definitely be from the fall. You may have injured yourself and we just want to make sure there's no fractures like a hip fracture."
58,MSK,patient,OK.
58,MSK,doctor,"One thing that's also something that we have to investigate is something called slipped capital femoral epiphysis. So this is, this is a common hip issue in adolescents, especially from boys aged 10 to 16. And usually it's the left hip that's affected, but it it can be the right. And as adolescents are in a phase where they were growing, there is, if they have some predisposed disposition too slipping of the capital femoral if epiphysis, which is right between your hips, you can get some slipping. It can be after a fall or it can happen just as the child is growing, and it can also it is also associated with the increasing weight that a child may have. So what we can do is just get first an X-Ray of both the hips."
58,MSK,patient,OK.
58,MSK,doctor,"And see like what we can find on the X-Ray and then will also do a full examination. And it, if it does turn out that there is a fracture or there's a slipped capital femoral epiphysis we will need to send out a referral to pediatric orthopedic surgery."
58,MSK,patient,OK.
58,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so yeah, first we'll just get the image Ng done and see what's going on in there and then we'll get back to you shortly."
58,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds great. Thank you so much."

59,RES,patient,"I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner."
59,RES,doctor,OK is this daily?
59,RES,patient,"Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week."
59,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?"

59,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?"
59,RES,doctor,"So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?"
59,RES,patient,"OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up."
59,RES,doctor,"Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics."
59,RES,patient,"OK, alright that sounds good, thank you."
60,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
60,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've had a sore throat that's been really bugging me the past four days and I've had a cough as well."
60,RES,doctor,"Mhmm. Uhm, when did the cough start?"
60,RES,patient,"Yeah, so the the the cough started last week actually, and then and then I I got this sore throat afterwards."
60,RES,doctor,"Mhmm. OK, and is it a dry cough or wet cough?"
60,RES,patient,It's dry.
60,RES,doctor,OK. And has it gotten better or worse or stayed the same since last week?
60,RES,patient,"Uh, it's it's gotten a little bit, little bit better."
60,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. And the sore throat started four days ago, are you having any difficulties swallowing at all?"
60,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's really sore."
60,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, and I guess going back to the cough, does it make it difficult for you to fall asleep at night or does it wake you up in the middle of the night?"
60,RES,patient,"No I, it hasn't done that."
60,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. Other uh, and and I guess this sore throat has just gotten worse over the past four days or has been kind of the same or better?"
60,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's gotten a little, it's gotten a little bit worse over the last few days."
60,RES,doctor,"OK, do you have any other symptoms like headaches, stuffy nose, runny nose, uhm any discharge from your eyes, red eyes, any pain in your ears? Anything like that?"
60,RES,patient,"Yeah, but that you mention that yeah, I I have had like some itchy eyes, that and a runny nose. I was sneezing quite a bit last week, but that has kind of ah, gone away now."

60,RES,doctor,"OK. And no pneumonia or anything like that, right?"
60,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."

60,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
60,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?"
60,RES,patient,"I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think."
60,RES,doctor,OK.
60,RES,patient,"But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having."
60,RES,doctor,"Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do."
60,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good."
60,RES,doctor,Alright.
60,RES,patient,Thank you.
60,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you're welcome."
61,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
61,RES,patient,"Hi yes I'm just coming in, uh over the last week, I've been having um like a cough, runny nose and a lot of congestion as well. So I just wanted to come in here to make sure nothing's wrong."
61,RES,doctor,"I see, alright, and when did the uh cough start? Was it 7 days ago?"
61,RES,patient,"A bit less than that, I would say it's been probably like five or six days."
61,RES,doctor,"OK, um and has the cough been getting any better or any worse or staying the same?"
61,RES,patient,Um it's kind of the same.
61,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you bringing up any uh sputum with the cough?"
61,RES,patient,"No, it's mainly like a dry cough, but I am getting like a lot of drainage and uh just congestion in my nose."

61,RES,patient,Um just when I'm congested like I feel like I can't really smell.
61,RES,doctor,"I see, alright. Have you had a loss or a change in your sense of taste?"
61,RES,patient,No.

62,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?"
62,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."

64,RES,doctor,OK. And any concerns for like exposures while you're at work in terms like breathing in any dusts or any fumes.
64,RES,patient,"Um were given a um personal protective equipment um for those concerns, but when I was younger I used to work a in shipyards and constructions and like old buildings and stuff, and I know there was some concern for not being ah properly equipped with the right equipment for protection and safety at that point so. Uh yeah, it's possible. I've been exposed to some things."
64,RES,doctor,I see is there a chance that there could have been asbestos at any of those places that you worked?
64,RES,patient,"Yeah, asbestos or mold. Yeah, you name it. Probably everything."
64,RES,doctor,"Yeah, I see this was like 10 years ago 20 years ago or or longer?"
64,RES,patient,"Yeah, and so it would have been. Yeah, about like 30 years ago or yeah 30, 40 years ago and. I worked in those places for 30 to 40 years, so. Around that time."
64,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
64,RES,patient,Um I quit recently since I found out that I might have COPD.
64,RES,doctor,"Oh congratulations, it's not easy to quit."
64,RES,patient,Thank you.

64,RES,patient,No.
64,RES,doctor,OK. And I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on history today. Um was there anything else that you wanted to add that I maybe forgot about?
64,RES,patient,"Um no that was it, but how like what can I take to make these symptoms go away?"
64,RES,doctor,"Well yeah, so at this time It will be important to get some lung imaging and and possibly, some other investigations as well because of your exposure uh to inhalants and fumes, and possibly asbestos. So I’m concerned there could be possibly an asbestos related lung illness that that you have. Um and so it will be important to investigate for, yeah possibly a asbestos related lung cancer,"
64,RES,patient,OK?
64,RES,doctor,Yeah.
64,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
65,DER,patient,"Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man coming in, I'm worried there's a little old rash on my leg that I'm getting nervous about."
65,DER,doctor,"Hi, so you I understand you have a rash on your leg."
65,DER,patient,"I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it more hurts than anything."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, uh, how long is this been going on for?"
65,DER,patient,"Ah, it's been it's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes, it started hurting yesterday and started looking strange and I just wanted to come in to get it checked out."
65,DER,doctor,"OK when you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that?"
65,DER,patient,"Swollen, it looks bigger than it did before, and meaner, if that makes sense."
65,DER,doctor,"Swollen OK, is it red?"
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, it's red, it's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these I got these scabs. I've got diabetes and I'm not exactly the best with it and scratching at it, and normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking and there's no other word for it."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you kinda just said that you didn't, but I'll just double check."
65,DER,patient,"No no. Well I've had,  I have occasional ulcers and sometimes I have banged my toe when I'm not exactly the best taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gotten something that I don't know, I've just never seen it before."
65,DER,doctor,Do you have any ulcers right now?
65,DER,patient,"Let me see. I think so, when's the last time I saw the family doc? I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing alright."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, and what leg are you having this problem with?"
65,DER,patient,"Right now it's on my right, so my ankle."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, how have your sugars been controlled recently?"
65,DER,patient,"I stopped measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think my A1C last time was like 9 something. I'm trying, I'm trying better to be with it. It's hard with work you know?"
65,DER,doctor,"For sure, I can imagine so, in general, even if you don't know your numbers for your sugars, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt rundown at all?"
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, actually I have gained more, feel hungry, sometimes just tired, but it's hard to tell. There's an awful lot going on in my life right now with the kids, but, It's hard to tell I think. Yeah, I need to see my family doc."
65,DER,doctor,"OK. Definitely you know a good a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things, but I'm glad you came in today so we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms?"
65,DER,patient,"Symptoms? Um, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started it's it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the one of what used to be a scab so now like kind of an open wound now."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, OK so when did you start feeling hot?"
65,DER,patient,"Honestly, last 12 hours."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, you take your temperature at all?"
65,DER,patient,"No, I don't have a thermometer at home."
65,DER,doctor,Have you had any difficulty breathing?
65,DER,patient,No no.
65,DER,doctor,Any chest pain?
65,DER,patient,No.
65,DER,doctor,"Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left?"
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, yeah it does. Actually changing socks the other day, yeah."
65,DER,doctor,"Right. Say, have you alone have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all?"
65,DER,patient,"Aside from just feeling overall crummy last couple weeks, no don't really, less energy today, but I was up last night thinking about this and yeah wanted to come in and talk."
65,DER,doctor,"OK yeah, you did the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your legs worse when you touch it?"
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it it, it doesn't like that."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, uhm."
65,DER,patient,"Just resting it right now, it feels fine."
65,DER,doctor,"It's OK, OK. OK, well I'm going to if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg I will, I'll go back to it, but I'm going to just move on and ask you questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with?"
65,DER,patient,"Chronic condition? I see the family doc about cholesterol. I'm on a pill for that. Uhm, I had asthma as a kid, not too much of an issue now. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years, but all I really take for it is Tylenol Advil for that."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, oh my other question about your leg was, have you lost any feeling in it?"
65,DER,patient,"It kind of is like a dull ache sometimes when I touch it. But, no like,  in the area, the ankle no, but definitely on my feet, like over the years I've noticed I feel less on it compared to what I did previously, yeah."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, so sorry I kind of sidetracked there so we talked about your diabetes. You said you have high cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking?"
65,DER,patient,"I'm taking 4 pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called. rosuvastatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications, but I don't remember. Metformin is one of them. Sidas...something I have a list somewhere. I'll give it to you later."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, are you on insulin right now?"
65,DER,patient,No.
65,DER,doctor,"Are you on any or any of these medications new to you, recently?"
65,DER,patient,"No no, but had them for about a year now."
65,DER,doctor,Do you have any allergies?
65,DER,patient,"Um, yeah, I do actually. Penicillin, can't take that."
65,DER,doctor,And what happens when you take penicillin?
65,DER,patient,"It's been a while, as a kid apparently like my face got bloated and I was having a hard time breathing so..."
65,DER,doctor,"Well, we will make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery?"
65,DER,patient,"Oh yeah, uh, what was it? I had my sinuses, had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens and they went in and kind of carved a little space out."
65,DER,doctor,"OK, OK. Is that the only surgery that you had?"
65,DER,patient,Yeah.
65,DER,doctor,"And can you tell me, do you have any family history of diabetes, skin problems, anything else that stands out to you?"
65,DER,patient,"Yep, mom's side of the family, very much everyone has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. Dad's side of the the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, but she's a pretty big smoker too."
65,DER,doctor,And then just ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children.
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, I do."
65,DER,doctor,Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids?
65,DER,patient,I live in town. I see my kids every two weeks.
65,DER,doctor,"And, uh. What do you do for work? Did I already ask you this?"
65,DER,patient,"No, I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, partially employed, I suppose we should say I have my own business."
65,DER,doctor,"I see and, what do you, what do you do when when you are working, ideally?"
65,DER,patient,"When I am working, I'm an accountant."
65,DER,doctor,"OK well, and do you smoke?"
65,DER,patient,"Yeah once in a while, yeah, when I'm stressed."
65,DER,doctor,How much do you smoke on average?
65,DER,patient,"Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more, maybe like 2 packs a week."
65,DER,doctor,OK. Do you drink alcohol?
65,DER,patient,Yeah yeah.
65,DER,doctor,How much do you typically drink?
65,DER,patient,"Average week, maybe a 2 4."
65,DER,doctor,So maybe like 3 per day or something like that if you were to average it out?
65,DER,patient,"Yeah, if you average out I mainly go through the two four in a weekend to be honest."
65,DER,doctor,"Oh, I see. OK, more so on the weekend, so maybe a little bit more than three per day on those days?"
65,DER,patient,Mhm.
65,DER,doctor,OK so that that that's everything that I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward to the physical exam?
65,DER,patient,No I just want to get this figured out.
65,DER,doctor,"OK, yeah, we will definitely do that for you. So yeah, I'm going to have a look at it and then after that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with and we'll see what we can do for you. That sounds good?"
65,DER,patient,"Thank you doc, yeah sounds great."
65,DER,doctor,Awesome OK thanks.

66,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly. So, I, so it's sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or there are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID. As you can be like nonspecific symptoms, such as having kind of just like a runny nose like you do here, and so we will do a COVID swab and we'll await those results, but in the meantime it's mostly supportive care, so it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested. And just monitor your symptoms because if things do get worse, it'll be important to, uh, go to the emergency room."
66,RES,patient,OK.
66,RES,doctor,"Alright, so we'll get the swab now and get that testing started."
66,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds great, thank you."

67,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've noticed some redness and then I also feel like there's like some material, like whitish material coming up from the back of my throat."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, this could be a uh, what they call a tonsillar exudate possibly, we'll look on physical exam. OK, does it look like there's swelling in the back of your mouth?"
67,RES,patient,"Yeah, it definitely looks angry."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any swelling in your neck as well like either on on the sides, like, or any lumps there?"

67,RES,patient,"Yeah, I I live with my parents right now in a, in a house just in the city. And I also live with my older brother."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been going to school?"
67,RES,patient,"Yeah, right now it's online school right now due to the pandemic."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, and has anybody at home been sick or have you been around anybody who's been sick?"
67,RES,patient,"My brother did have like similar sore throat symptoms, I think maybe two weeks ago and he did get some medications from the doctor."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, so did he get antibiotics?"
67,RES,patient,I think so. I think he got some antibiotics.
67,RES,doctor,OK. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
67,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
67,RES,doctor,"Alright and, I know if some people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Have you or any of your friends tried anything like that before?"
67,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, and everything that we talk about is always confidential, so you can feel safe sharing with me, and so has there been any concerns with physical or emotional violence at home?"
67,RES,patient,"No, I feel pretty safe. My parents are pretty caring and loving."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's excellent. And are you sexually active?"
67,RES,patient,No.
67,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been sexually active in the past?"
67,RES,patient,"No, not at all."
67,RES,doctor,"OK. And now in the family, are there any conditions such as heart problems or lung problems that run in the family?"
67,RES,patient,"Uh, no. Like my parents are pretty healthy."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and any cancers that run in the family?"
67,RES,patient,No.
67,RES,doctor,"OK, and how's school going?"
67,RES,patient,"School is going pretty well, no real issues. It took some time and adjusting to the new online curriculum, but it's going pretty well now."
67,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you been able to, uh, adjust. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask about on history today. Did you have anything else that you maybe wanted to add? Or that I maybe forgot to ask about?"
67,RES,patient,No. I think that those are all the questions I had.
67,RES,doctor,"OK, so with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age and the like swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat is likely a group a strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation."
67,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
67,RES,doctor,Thank you.
68,RES,doctor,What can I do for you today?
68,RES,patient,I've just had this cough that it that has gotten a lot worse and really short of breath.
68,RES,doctor,"Uhm, can you tell me more about your shortness of breath?"
68,RES,patient,"Yeah, just over the past, like 12 hours or so, I've just been finding it more and more difficult to to breathe."
68,RES,doctor,"OK. What are you able, I guess when do you feel short of breath?"
68,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's just like right now at rest I can like I'm OK, but it still is feeling increasingly difficult. So like throughout the day, it's just been getting getting worse and the cough has been getting worse also."
68,RES,doctor,"And before these 12 hours where, did you have any difficulties with breathing?"
68,RES,patient,"Uh no, I I I had a cough but not, not really any shortness of breath."
68,RES,doctor,And can you tell me about your cough? Is it a dry cough or wet cough?
68,RES,patient,I've been bringing up some some sputum.
68,RES,doctor,"OK, what does it look like?"

68,RES,doctor,"Mhmm, OK. And you said that you had a cough prior to the past 12 hours. And that your cough is now worse. How is it worse?"
68,RES,patient,"Ah, it's been just happening more often and like just like throughout the day usually, my cough is only in the morning. I'll bring up some some sputum in it and I'm ok, but it's carried on throughout the day."

68,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah, we can definitely do that here. Uhm, alright. So, given your symptoms, it sounds like maybe you're having a COPD exacerbation, potentially. Do you feel like you might have had contact with anyone who was sick?"

68,RES,doctor,"OK, have you traveled at all, outside the country or outside the province?"

68,RES,patient,"Yeah, we are like, I'm like helping out with cleaning the carts and kind of helping out with the grounds."
68,RES,doctor,"Mhmm, OK, alright. So we'll do a Covid swab here just in case. And seeing that you're not feeling very well, you might require oxygen, we're going to keep you here in the ER, and we might have to, you might have to be hospitalized. We'll measure your vitals, do a physical exam, do a chest x-ray and you might be having, as I mentioned earlier, in exacerbation, upper COPD or a worsening of your COPD, potentially because you might have an infection, either a viral infection or bacterial infection that can sometimes worsen your COPD symptoms. You might be started on an antibiotic we'll be putting you in oxygen and giving you some steroid some, are you actually about that, are you, are you using any puffers at home?"
68,RES,patient,"Ah, yeah, so yeah I have been using uh, sorry I I have been using ventolin and there was a daily inhaler, Spiriva, I believe. I've been using that each day."

69,GAS,patient,"Um, have I experienced something like this before? Uhm no, I don't think so."
69,GAS,doctor,"OK. And over the three or four days, have your stools all been loose? Or have you had some solid ones in between?"
69,GAS,patient,"I think they've mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose actually, if I think about it."
69,GAS,doctor,"OK, and how many times a day have you been having episodes of diarrhea?"
69,GAS,patient,"Oh my god, I have I've lost count. I'm going every every hour."

69,GAS,patient,Um not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much to be honest.
69,GAS,doctor,"OK, um have you noticed any any pain associated with it?"
69,GAS,patient,"Well, I didn't start off with pain, but I I I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It's just it hurts. Yeah, it hurts sometimes, it comes and goes."
69,GAS,doctor,"OK, and do you feel that when it, do you feel that you still have control over like releasing it to like does it come on and you don't even notice that it has happened or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet?"
69,GAS,patient,"Uh no I do get a warning, but it's just I I do need to get to the toilet really fast, yeah."
69,GAS,doctor,"OK, and before this happened, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently, or any other changes that have happened in your life recently?"
69,GAS,patient,"Um, I I did go to um, I did go to a new restaurant 5 days ago."

69,GAS,patient,"Um  I I just got some rice with chicken Manchurian, it was a nice little Chinese restaurant, and yeah."
69,GAS,doctor,Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with?
69,GAS,patient,"Um, no not really, I went with my friend and I haven't really, haven't talked to her about this. I never really thought that these were related, that this was related to that."
69,GAS,doctor,"And then it's, you know, absolutely, potentially not like, maybe not. It could possibly be so not to not to worry you about that. We just like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in with. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?"
69,GAS,patient,"Yeah yeah, I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even yeah, I didn't, I wasn't even thinking about that. Yeah, I I did vomit, I think twice yesterday."

69,GAS,patient,"Uh, not really. I was just trying to drink a lot of water, 'cause I I know that I can get dehydrated so just drinking lots of water."
69,GAS,doctor,"OK, well that's good to hear. Have you have you been eating normally or have you not been eating as much as you regularly do?"
69,GAS,patient,I have been eating less specially since yesterday when I had my these abdominal cramps started. I just don't feel like eating.
69,GAS,doctor,OK. Is there anything that has been making it worse?
69,GAS,patient,Making what worse?

71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what kind of pain is it, is it like an aching pain, is it sharp pain?"
71,MSK,patient,"It'll be a bit at achey when it's there, but I if I move the joints at all when it's really sore, I can get a sharp pain as well."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is this pain worse at all at any particular time of the day?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I would say in the morning time or if there's any period of time where I I'm like sitting and resting for awhile and I get up to move. I have a lot of stiffness and it takes me over an hour, sometimes to just get moving."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, um so so if I understand it clearly it's. You get, do you get like morning you get morning stiffness and then when you're not very active or not doing things but then it gets better with movement?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, exactly, yeah there's morning stiffness and it does get a little bit better with with movement."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, do you have any of this pain or stiffness in the bigger joints in your body, like the hips or the knees or your shoulders?"
71,MSK,patient,"Uh, no nothing, no. Just really the small joints."
71,MSK,doctor,OK in the morning stiffness lasts more than 30 minutes you said?
71,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah."
71,MSK,doctor,"Yes, OK. Is is it symmetrical like is the pain symmetrical as in is it happening in both hands in the same areas and both feet in the same areas?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah it is actually now that you mentioned that, it is symmetrical. I'm noticing that it's the same. It's the same joints on both sides of my body that I'm seeing that are affected."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK now yeah, I I just have. Yeah, this one particular question. It's pretty specific, so when you look at your hands in which joints are painful. In your fingers is, do you, do you have any pain or swelling in the last joints like so just um, just, below the tip of your fingers?"
71,MSK,patient,"No, actually like the those joints are all, have been fine. I can move the tips of my fingers no problem, and I haven't had any joint swelling or pain in the tips of my fingers."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about, have you had any pain at all in the, I guess the first joints of the finger. So when you make a fist like the first joint that bends?"
71,MSK,patient,"Oh yeah, like my knuckles, you mean?"
71,MSK,doctor,Yeah that your knuckles.
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah those actually. Those are the worst I can notice, those kind of on the like on my index finger, middle finger and and ring finger on both sides they they all look like they're swollen and and those hurt hurt really bad."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and in your feet, which joints would you say are hurting the most?"
71,MSK,patient,"I, I would say the like the big toe joint. On both of my feet, those bother me. Yeah, but my big my big toe on on both feet, but my right foot's worse than the other."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see OK. And are you getting any pain in any other joints?"
71,MSK,patient,"Um actually yeah my my right ankle bugs me a little bit. I'm sorry if that's considered a large joint. But yeah, my ankle hurts and then also my in my hands I have. Like the middle one. Not proximal interphalangeal joint, yeah those ones hurt too."
71,MSK,doctor,OK.
71,MSK,patient,I think I have like more than 10 joints that are swollen and painful.
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see and has this pain been pretty constant or have there been days that you don't have the pain?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, there are days that are better than others for sure. It just. I'm not really too sure what the reason it is like. Maybe I'm just more rested or something like that, but. There are days that that are better, but over the last several months it's been getting getting worse."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how much would you rate the pain from zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?"
71,MSK,patient,I would say it's probably a 6.
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you tried any medications at all to help with your, help relieve your symptoms?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I've been trying. Um acetaminophen and different types of anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or Advil and I've tried creams and stuff too but it it doesn't seem to, help."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK. Are you feeling any other symptoms at all, like fevers or chills?"
71,MSK,patient,Um I do. I have felt a bit warm.
71,MSK,doctor,"A bit warm, OK and how long has that been going on for?"
71,MSK,patient,"So it that varies as well, like some days I'll get. I'll feel like feverish for a little bit and it will kind of go away. I haven't checked my temperature, but, it I have felt warm at times."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you lost any movement in any of these joints at all?"
71,MSK,patient,Uh it is harder to to make a fist. Yeah I can't fully close my my fingers all the way down to make a fist.
71,MSK,doctor,I see. OK. Any kind of a um night sweats at all?
71,MSK,patient,No.
71,MSK,doctor,Any weight loss?
71,MSK,patient,"Um, well I think a few pounds, I just haven't really been as as hungry now. Yeah, my appetite hasn't been been as good recently."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, any skin changes or rashes?"
71,MSK,patient,"I over a couple of the joints, I do notice some some redness, but just over the the joints on my hand I can have some redness."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, but you don't notice any changes anywhere else?"

71,MSK,doctor,"OK, uhm. And in terms of your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any conditions?"
71,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah I have a low thyroid and or or hypothyroidism. I think it's called I and I also have. Uh, high blood pressure, so I take my medication for high blood pressure and and something for the thyroid as well."

71,MSK,patient,"I I think my cousin actually has type one diabetes. He's a, like he's much younger than me, but yeah, I think he I have a cousin with type one diabetes as well."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, and um currently do you work?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I've been working as a administrator so it's been tough on the computer with with how my hands have been causing me pain."
71,MSK,doctor,Oh so from the typing also gives you some pain?
71,MSK,patient,"Yeah I can. It can give me a little bit of pain, but once my hands start moving it's it's OK. It's just I'm a bit slower at my job with with how it is, especially starting in the morning."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. OK, and currently what's your living situation like?"
71,MSK,patient,"So I live with my husband as well as our, uh, our daughter. She's 4."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you currently right now, do you smoke at all?"
71,MSK,patient,I I don't. I quit smoking four years ago when my daughter was born and before that I didn't smoke much to me anyway it was I was only smoking like you like maybe four or five cigarettes a day so I just stopped then.
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's really good. Uh, uh, congratulations."
71,MSK,patient,Thank you.
71,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, and other than that, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
71,MSK,doctor,"Uh, no, I don't. OK, how about alcohol?"
71,MSK,patient,"I'll have a glass of wine sometimes, but very rarely."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um yeah, so those are just some of the questions I had for you now. I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt. So when you look at those joints, do you notice any kind of swelling, redness, or when you feel any warmth to them?"
71,MSK,patient,"Yes I yeah I do. I feel swelling, warmth and redness."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you notice any kind of deformities, for example like you're not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you didn't see before? Or, like, for example, your wrist is turned uh, outwards a little bit. Anything like that?"
71,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, nothing like that, no deformity."
71,MSK,doctor,"No deformities. OK, when you go over your joints, do you notice any kind of like nodules or harder materials that don't seem to be your bones?"
71,MSK,patient,"Not really, no. No, I don't notice anything like that. They just share a bit larger from the swelling it feels like."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. Are you able to make a fist with both both hands?"
71,MSK,patient,"Not completely, I can close my hands part of the way, but I can't make a full fist."
71,MSK,doctor,I see. OK and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms?
71,MSK,patient,Yeah I can do. I can do that.
71,MSK,doctor,OK. And are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that?
71,MSK,patient,"Um, yes I can."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
71,MSK,patient,"Um no, I'm just wondering what what this could be."
71,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well. So does that sound good?"
71,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, thank you."
71,MSK,doctor,"You're welcome. And then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis arthritis, which seems likely, you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat your, uh, treat you with medications."
71,MSK,doctor,"OK, thank you alright, you're welcome. Take care."
72,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
72,MSK,patient,"I've just been experiencing a, some pain and numbness and tingling in in just my wrist area and thumb, middle finger, and index finger."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when did this pain start and is it the right hand or or left hand?"
72,MSK,patient,"Hum, it's the right. It's a the right hand, but I also find it so starting to happen in the left hand as well, but more so on the right hand. I feel this kind of sensation over my palms and fingers it started I would say probably 2 weeks ago. And it's been, I think it's gradually been getting worse. I'm having more difficulty at nighttime, especially. It's also waking me up from sleep, and it's yeah just affecting my daily routine, my work. So yeah, I just wanted to understand what was going on."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see and did you have any trauma to the wrist or or any injury, or have you had an injury in the past?"
72,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't had any falls, no accidents, nothing like that."
72,MSK,doctor,OK. And are you right or left handed?
72,MSK,patient,I'm right handed.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, and you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first and then the left one has started since then?"
72,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah, and I don't know if it's just 'cause I use my right hand more that I feel more pain and the symptoms. But yeah, I definitely would say it's worse."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located?"
72,MSK,patient,"So the pain I feel like it's more like a discomfort. Just over the like palm, like near the wrist and the lower palm area is where the discomfort is and then the numbness and tingling is just like in thumb an the 1st 2 digits."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how would you describe the character of this sensation, is it burning, is it sharp, achy or or stabby?"
72,MSK,patient,"Um I would say it's more of kind of like an aching, aching pain. Um it does sometimes turn into kind of like a burning sensation with the tingling, but yeah, more so on the palmer like on the palm side of things, it's more like an aching pain."
72,MSK,doctor,OK. And you have some burning as well?
72,MSK,patient,Yeah.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK. And is the does it radiate anywhere, are you feeling this in in your neck, shoulder, or down your arm at all?"
72,MSK,patient,"It kind of goes from the palm, along, so it goes from the palm it goes upwards like to my fingers, but also backwards like into my lower arm as well. Like my forearm."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you have any pain in the neck?"
72,MSK,patient,In my neck?
72,MSK,doctor,Yeah.
72,MSK,patient,No.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, an anything that you've done that makes the pain worse?"
72,MSK,patient,"Uh. I I just have to like I work as an accountant. There's a lot of work I do on the computer with a keyboard mouse, so I feel like it's hard to really do that all day right now. So I think if I do that, I'll make it worse. But if I take a rest and kind of just shake my hands a little bit, then it gets better."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, um so kind of like flicking your wrist sort of thing, so kind of shake out the?"
72,MSK,patient,Yeah.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, um an anything that you do that makes it better besides those moves like have you taken any medications or tried any like wrist splints or anything like that?"
72,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't tried any medications or splints."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst you've ever felt and do you feel this pain at any particular time of day more than than others?"
72,MSK,patient,"The pain is probably like a, a 5,  and I feel it more during the night as well as like when I'm working, I feel it's definitely more as I continue to do more work."
72,MSK,doctor,I see OK. And. Have you had any like numbness and and that tingling in the hand or anywhere else?
72,MSK,patient,"No, just in the areas that I described nowhere else."

72,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, I don't think so."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about any issues with like gripping objects, dropping objects or like opening jars?"
72,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I I do I do have like when I'm lifting things and opening jars opening lids like I do have the similar discomfort, pain as well as the numbness and tingling."

72,MSK,doctor,"OK, um and in the family are there any musculoskeletal or like neurological conditions?"
72,MSK,patient,No.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or like hypothyroidism or type one diabetes?"
72,MSK,patient,In my family history? I think there is.
72,MSK,doctor,Yeah.
72,MSK,patient,"Some, there's definitely some diabetes on my father's side. But other than that, I think one of my aunts on my mother side had um a hysterectomy for cancer."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright and was it endometrial cancer?"
72,MSK,patient,"Not sure actually, but she I just know that she had her uterus removed."
72,MSK,doctor,I see alright and um so next I wanted to just move to the physical exam portion and so just first inspecting the hand and wrist do you see any swelling or redness?
72,MSK,patient,No.
72,MSK,doctor,"How about any changes to temperature, do any of the joints feel warm?"
72,MSK,patient,No.
72,MSK,doctor,And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand?
72,MSK,patient,"Uhm, maybe like just a little bit like I feel like I've lost some of like the fat pad just right near my thumb."
72,MSK,doctor,I see OK. And is there any areas of your hands over like any of the joints or over the rest that if you press you feel pain?
72,MSK,patient,Um no.
72,MSK,doctor,OK and are you able to to move your wrist or the full range of motion?
72,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I can move it."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh. And is there any, uh, so that then the next test I'll just ask you to just tap on the the kind of base of your palm there with your index finger and middle finger of your left hand, and when you do that, do you feel any burning or tingling?"
72,MSK,patient,Yeah yeah. I definitely do.
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, so that would be, yeah, positive Tinel sign and do you get any, so if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other. And if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling?"
72,MSK,patient,"Um yeah, I do feel it as well there."
72,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright so that was everything I wanted to ask about and check today um did you have any questions?"
72,MSK,patient,"No, I just wanted to know how I can fix this."
72,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly so it's sounding like a carpal tunnel syndrome which that the differential would be something like radiculopathy coming up up from the neck, which you're not having any neck symptoms and the positive Tenel sign and positive Phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing. And so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also, uh depending on like if there is inflammation there NSAIDs might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification, and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well."
72,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good."
72,MSK,doctor,OK.
73,RES,patient,I've been having issues with just a cough that's just been constantly like bothering me for the past few bit.
73,RES,doctor,"OK, um, when did this, what can you tell me a little bit more about the cough itself? Any any sputum?"
73,RES,patient,"So yeah, it it does have some like dark yellow greenish mucus material every time I cough. That's not doesn't always happen, but it's been worse like that keeps happening over the last few days."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, and any blood in the sputum?"
73,RES,patient,No.
73,RES,doctor,"OK, and how much have you been bringing up would you say?"
73,RES,patient,"I would say every time I bring it up it's around like one teaspoon, usually one teaspoon in the day."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did this cough start?"
73,RES,patient,"Um, so I think it started around like I would say six months ago and it's kind of just coming it just keeps coming and going here and there, but it's recently just starting to get very irritating."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, and um any triggers or uh precipitating events for for the cough?"
73,RES,patient,"So like six months ago I remember I was in just in Phys.Ed and we were just doing some laps and that's when I just really started coughing. And yeah, nothing else was really going on. I just feel like when I started running sometimes I start to cough."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and has the cough been getting worse or staying the same, getting better?"
73,RES,patient,"I think it was pretty it was pretty much the same over the last few months, but then over the last week I would say just got really bad and over the last few days it's just been getting worse and worse."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, um so it's been the cough has been happening on and off up until four days ago, it sounds like. Uh, is the cough happening daily now?"
73,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I would say like I'm coughing especially the last few days coughing several times a day. Um, it's pretty random, but like I would say throughout the day, I'm coughing."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, anything you've tried to make the offer better?"
73,RES,patient,"Um, I mean, really, I, I didn't really know what to try, um, so no, I haven't tried anything."
73,RES,doctor,"OK and anything you've noticed that that so I guess, yeah, anything you notice that makes it worse?"
73,RES,patient,"So yeah, just like when I'm doing more activities, especially running, I find, uh I just get like these coughing fits and it just gets worse when I'm running. Yeah, it's pretty annoying because even sometimes when I'm just in class I just start coughing randomly, but I would say it's the worst when I'm doing activities."
73,RES,doctor,"OK, so exercising brings out the cough? Any other symptoms you've been experiencing besides the cough?"
73,RES,patient,"Uh the only thing that sometimes, uh, like I panic sometimes when uh when I have like a really bad coughing fit especially in gym class. It almost feels like I can't breathe and that's when I get really scared."
73,RES,doctor,"OK um, have you been having any nausea or vomiting?"
73,RES,patient,"Oh no, no nausea or vomiting."
73,RES,doctor,OK. How about any headaches?
73,RES,patient,"No, no headaches."
73,RES,doctor,OK and have you had a fever?
73,RES,patient,"Uh I think I felt like a little bit warmer in the past few days, but I didn't I didn't really check."

74,RES,patient,"Um no, I was just curious if you think I had COVID?"
74,RES,doctor,"Certainly one of the top things that I'm considering after hearing about your symptoms of having this cough and fever and being tired these last few days, especially with your husband being sick with nausea, vomiting, and not feeling well. That being said, it could be another type of viral illness, or possibly a bacterial infection. But certainly we will order some investigations, some blood work, a PCR nasal swab that will actually test for COVID as well as a chest X Ray to start with. Um and we will wait for some of those results to come back."
74,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good."
74,RES,doctor,"Alright, so we'll get that started."
74,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
75,RES,doctor,I was wondering if we could start with you telling us what brought you in?
75,RES,patient,"Sure, I've had this terrible headache for the past four days. Doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I feel hot like I have a fever. I've been coughing a lot so I am I'm worried I have COVID, so I'm here."
75,RES,doctor,OK. So I'll start with the headaches. When did when did that exactly started?
75,RES,patient,"Uh the headache started, OK so the coughing started four days ago. The headache started shortly after so I would say later on during that day and then the fever I've had for, fever I think I've had for the past two days. I haven't actually taken my temperature though."
75,RES,doctor,"OK um. So, uh, the cough is started four days ago. Has the cough gotten better, worse, or stayed the same?"
75,RES,patient,The cough has stayed the same.

75,RES,patient,"We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern."
75,RES,doctor,OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike?
75,RES,patient,"Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that."
75,RES,doctor,I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?

75,RES,doctor,Do you use any other recreational drugs?
75,RES,patient,Um no.
75,RES,doctor,"OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness?"
75,RES,patient,"No, not that I noticed."
75,RES,doctor,OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?
75,RES,patient,"No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?"
75,RES,doctor,"Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations."
75,RES,patient,"OK great, thank you."
75,RES,doctor,"Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started."
75,RES,patient,"OK, sounds great."
76,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
76,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've had this cough and it's just not going away."
76,RES,doctor,"OK, and how long have you been having this cough for?"
76,RES,patient,I think it started about a month ago.
76,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it a dry cough or is it a wet cough?"
76,RES,patient,I I'm bringing up some phlegm if that's what you mean.
76,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so you're bringing up phlegm when you cough?"

77,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, I haven't I haven't heard it now."
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, and so uh next, I just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion, so just a couple more questions. So when you're looking at your hand, are you seeing any swelling redness?"
77,MSK,patient,"Not swelling, I just yeah just those nodules and I get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when I extend my fingers."
77,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, but no redness?"
77,MSK,patient,No.
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you are you seeing any, uh like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist?"
77,MSK,patient,Nope.
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, and uh are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain."
77,MSK,patient,"Yeah, there's just some discomfort, like when I at the bases of those two fingers, like if I press on the nodules like it's sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it's not too bad. Like I, I don't, but I don't know I have a pretty high pain threshold too, so it's hard to say."
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension?"
77,MSK,patient,"Yeah definitely. I would say more painful than if I try to extend it myself. Like just forcing it back but yeah, but not not anything too like I like it's not sharp or anything like that."
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, and with the on the nodules and stuff, do you feel any like crepitations or like crackling or rubbing over those, those areas or your palm?"
77,MSK,patient,Uhm crackling oh no not that I have noticed.
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, and any issues with your like wrist or or elbow?"
77,MSK,patient,"No, not that I know of."
77,MSK,doctor,OK. Uhm so I think that's everything that I wanted to ask about today. Did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions?
77,MSK,patient,"No, I think that's all."
77,MSK,doctor,"OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis."
77,MSK,patient,Mmmm
77,MSK,doctor,"But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture. It'll be a uh, do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand."
77,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good."
78,MSK,doctor,What brings you in here today?
78,MSK,patient,"Hi, hi there I've been having this knee pain. It started almost immediately after I was I was playing basketball on the high school team and it was during practice I jumped up for a rebound and I, when I landed I heard a pop of my my left knee and I immediately felt pain. I just went off to the off to the sideline."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when did this happen?"
78,MSK,patient,"Uh, this happened about. Probably like 6 hours ago. Maybe like a few hours ago."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, I see and since then have you been able to walk at all or have you been just, has it been very difficult?"
78,MSK,patient,"At first I was able to kind of limp off the court, but since then I I haven't really been able to walk. It's gotten pretty swollen since then and it looks bruised as well."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, it's swollen and bruised in what kind of pain are you having, is it like sharp or is it aching?"
78,MSK,patient,It's pretty sharp. It feels like there's people just stabbing me in the knee.
78,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uhm And um, do you have any, so you're having pain in your knee. Has it gone worse than when it started?"
78,MSK,patient,"Um. Yeah, it's yeah it feels a bit more painful than it did earlier. I think maybe the adrenaline was pumping a little bit. But yeah, now it's it's pretty pretty painful."
78,MSK,patient,"OK OK uhm. And how much would you rate the pain out of 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life?"
78,MSK,patient,"Oh, I'd say this is like a 9 or a 10, this is it's really painful."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, are you having pain anywhere else or is it just your left knee?"
78,MSK,patient,Just my left knee.
78,MSK,doctor,"OK alright. Are you having other symptoms like fainting, dizziness?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, I I haven't had anything like that."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you having any fevers, chills or anything like that?"
78,MSK,patient,No fevers or chills.
78,MSK,doctor,OK. Any kind of numbness or tingling at all?
78,MSK,patient,No no Mr tingling.
78,MSK,doctor,OK. Is the pain moving anywhere else from your knees?
78,MSK,patient,"Uh, no I just feel like pretty like just right in my in my knee."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what kind of motions are hurting you right now the most?"
78,MSK,patient,"I would say just like bending my knee, like, yeah, flexing my knee up as well as, like if I try to put any weight on it like I can't walk on it right now, I can't put any weight on my knee right now. And also even straightening it out hurts as well if I'm really flexing the muscle, so just trying to stay pretty immobile right now."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. OK, and in terms of other symptoms, any kind of chest pain, shortness of breath?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, any rashes or skin changes?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, the only skin change that I that I have is the like bruising or looks like you like blood around my knee."
78,MSK,doctor,OK you see is it warm to touch?
78,MSK,patient,"Um. No, no, it's not warm."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK. In terms of your past medical history, any conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?"

78,MSK,doctor,"OK, any allergies to any medications?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, I don't."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, and any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions?"
78,MSK,patient,"Um, no no, nothing like that I I I mean I think my dad I had a rotator cuff injury or something like that but I mean he's in his 50s now so I think that happened at work or something I don't know."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uhm, OK, and other than that, do you, so are you at school right now?"
78,MSK,patient,"I am yeah, I'm in grade grade 10 and playing well playing on the the high school basketball team and that's how I got this injury here."
78,MSK,doctor,And have you had a similar injury at all in the past?
78,MSK,patient,"No, I mean I'm I've I've sprained my ankles in the past, which would go would heal with some rest after a few days I never got those checked out because they're they weren't so bad, but I've never injured my knee before."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK and. Currently, right now, what's your living situation like?"
78,MSK,patient,"So I live with both of my parents and I also have a younger sibling. A sister, she's 8 years old and we have a dog as well."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, uhm. Alright, and have you experimented at all with any recreational drugs, alcohol, or smoking cigarettes?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that. I see kids at school um smoking and stuff, but, you know, as an athlete, I try to stay away from that kind of stuff as much as possible."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, no, yeah, that's really that's really good that you're thinking like that. Any issues at school like bullying or do you feel unsafe either at home, around your home environment or at school?"
78,MSK,patient,"No, I don't feel unsafe. I mean, I know there's always those kids at school who are mean to others. But I mean, I, I generally feel safe."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright so I'm just going to ask a few questions about just the examination part of part of this. Do you, so you mentioned you can't flex your knees at all, can you extend them?"
78,MSK,patient,"Yeah it it can, uh, straighten it out all like most of the way, it seems like it's bent a little still maybe from like the swelling and only I can't straighten it out the full way."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then you said you noticed like bruising and kind of like there's blood accumulating in that area?"
78,MSK,patient,"Yeah exactly yeah, it looks like it. 'cause it's a bit like Brown. I guess I can like see or on my knee I guess like the like a big bruise."
78,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. OK. And. Yeah, so those are kind of like all the questions I had for you. It seems that based on the description of how the injury happened an the mechanism and what you're feeling right now and in terms of the examination, it's possible that you had knee ligament injury. Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?"
78,MSK,patient,"It does. Yeah yeah, thank you."
78,MSK,doctor,"Welcome alright, Take care."
79,RES,doctor,How how may I help you?
79,RES,patient,"Hi uh nice to meet you. I've just uh been experiencing um a cough for the last few weeks and uh I also recently started noticing that I'm coughing up some blood as well, like it's mixed into like sputum."
79,RES,doctor,"I see, alright, so you said a few weeks for the cough. Is this more than three weeks, more than four weeks, or a few months?"
79,RES,patient,I would say it's almost I would say almost like three weeks now.
79,RES,doctor,"OK, when the cough started uh were you bringing up, um were you bringing up sputum or phlegm at that time?"
79,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, initially it was just like um kind of white too, sometimes yellowish phlegm, but now over the last week I've been also noticing um some blood in it as well."

81,GAS,patient,"Uh, yeah, no it's, it's also just like I was just reading up like, can it be like I don't know if it can be COVID as well, if it can, it can do this as well?"
81,GAS,doctor,"It is possible. Uh, it's uh, especially with nonspecific symptoms, COVID can cause a variety of different presentations, and there for some people it can be more gastrointestinal issues like like your son has with vomiting and diarrhea and belly pain. But it also could be well, uh, another type of gastrointestinal virus itself or or a viral illness like the common cold, which can also end up causing symptoms like this as well. So we will, I will go ahead and do a COVID test today, along with some other blood work. And maybe increase the hydration as well, because it sounds like he has lost a lot of fluid over these last couple of days. So we will check electrolytes and go from there on the test results."

82,RES,doctor,"OK, so with the prominent symptoms of being nasal discharge and obstruction without fever and without, like changes to smell and also without pain, it's most likely a viral rhinosinusitis. Uhm, however, this could have symptoms that overlap with, with COVID, and so we will still end up doing a swab even though the most likely diagnosis is going to be a viral acute rhinosinusitis."

Uhm, but from the sounds of what your symptoms are, it, it is most likely to be a common cold, in which case you can just manage it with a lot of hydration, nutrition, good sleep. But if your symptoms get worse or they're not going away after a couple of weeks, or you're having neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, you should get help from the ER. Does that sound OK?"
83,RES,patient,"Yeah, for sure I haven't had any any symptoms like that, so so far, so that's good."

84,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, what should I do about this cough?"
84,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so this cough, um, it's been going on for the last four days. Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough."
84,RES,patient,Okay.
84,RES,doctor,"Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions. And if, it can be anything else too, like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have um, like an upper respiratory, viral, or bacterial infection. But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. Um, this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like, uh pneumonia, for example. But right now, yeah, we'll get that testing done and then just, kind of wait and watch."
84,RES,patient,"Sure, yeah. Thank you."
84,RES,doctor,"You're welcome, take care."
84,RES,patient,You too.

85,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, as she had a fever the entire time over the past three or four days."
85,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say so like it's come and gone, but every time I checked her temperature, I tried to check her twice a day, it would be pretty high, like 38 or uh, 39."
85,RES,doctor,"Okay, so it was between 38 and 39 each time you checked it."
85,RES,patient,"Yeah, and now I should mention like um, I checked today and she didn't have a fever today, but she sounds really wheezy now."

85,RES,patient,"Uh no it's, it's just always there."
85,RES,doctor,"Okay, uh, is she bringing up any, any phlegm or sputum?"

85,RES,patient,It was clear.
85,RES,doctor,"Okay, any blood that you noticed there?"

85,RES,doctor,And how has her mood been?

85,RES,patient,Yeah.
85,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, it's still going on, but, but just less."
85,RES,patient,"That's right, yeah."
85,RES,doctor,"Okay. On feeds or anything like that, did you notice like any redness in her, in the back of her throat?"

85,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, so were there any other um, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today before I went on to the physical exam. Um, was there anything else that you, that you wanted to add or were wondering about that I maybe forgot to ask?"
85,RES,patient,"Yeah um, what, what can we do for her um, to make her better? And are you concerned about her breathing?"
85,RES,doctor,"Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels."
85,RES,patient,Yeah.
85,RES,doctor,"Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary."
85,RES,patient,"Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."
86,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
86,RES,patient,"Hi, I've just had a runny nose and a cough for the past uh week."
86,RES,doctor,"OK, um so for the past week you said, did the cough start first, or the runny nose?"
86,RES,patient,"Uh it started with the cough. I usually don't come in when I have symptoms like this uh, but I've just been, uhm, I just heard of someone who passed away due to Covid and I'm just like very scared and I just decided to come in."
86,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure that's understandable. Um With the cough, is it a dry cough or are you bringing up some phlegm?"
86,RES,patient,Um it's mostly a dry cough
86,RES,doctor,"Dry cough. OK, um and is it persistent or does it come and go?"

It's just, I just get into this coughing fit and I think there was a time when I had a little bit of blood come out as well, once or twice. The coughing also makes it difficult for me to breathe, you know, I feel very short of breath after that."

87,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you producing sputum each time you're coughing up?"
87,RES,patient,"Most of the times, yes."
87,RES,doctor,"OK, is this a change from previously? Did you have a dry cough before?"
87,RES,patient,"A bit more of a dry cough before, but I mean, so sometimes it will be a dry cough sometimes, uh, it was more of a wet cough, but it was, it was usually just this white thing coming up. It wasn't like, there was never blood before."

88,RES,patient,They've gotten worse since it's started.
88,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, well, it's only been two days so far, let's just keep an eye on your symptoms and see how you're doing. It might also be a good idea just to get a covid swab done, and if your symptoms continue to worsen, give me a call again and we can talk about it a little bit more and see if maybe a bacterial infection or if there's something else that's going on. You don't have any difficulties breathing, do you?"
88,RES,patient,"No, I don't."
88,RES,doctor,"Alright, OK, alright umm, we'll do a physical exam and then chat a little bit more after."
88,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
89,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
89,RES,patient,"Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well."
89,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?"
89,RES,patient,"So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me."
89,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?"
89,RES,patient,"Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, what color is your sputum?"
89,RES,patient,It's mainly like clear white.
89,RES,doctor,OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?
89,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?"
89,RES,patient,I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well.
89,RES,doctor,OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?
89,RES,patient,"Oh no, I don't really have any pains."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?"
89,RES,patient,"I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath."
89,RES,doctor,OK.
89,RES,patient,"But that was, I think, two years ago."
89,RES,doctor,"OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?"
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?"
89,RES,patient,Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.
89,RES,doctor,"OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?"
89,RES,patient,I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.
89,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss?"
89,RES,patient,No.
89,RES,doctor,"OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes?"
89,RES,patient,"Umm, no."
89,RES,doctor,Any changes in your vision or hearing?
89,RES,patient,Nope.
89,RES,doctor,And how about smell or taste?
89,RES,patient,"Umm, no. I think they're the same."
89,RES,doctor,OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?
89,RES,patient,"I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad."
89,RES,doctor,OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?
89,RES,patient,"No, not that I know."
89,RES,doctor,How about calf pain?
89,RES,patient,Nope.
89,RES,doctor,Dizziness or fainting spells?
89,RES,patient,No.
89,RES,doctor,Headaches?
89,RES,patient,No headaches.
89,RES,doctor,Memory loss or confusion?
89,RES,patient,Nope.
89,RES,doctor,Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?
89,RES,patient,Nope.
89,RES,doctor,Changes to urinating?
89,RES,patient,"No, that's all fine"
89,RES,doctor,"OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?"
89,RES,patient,"I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?"
89,RES,patient,"Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80."
89,RES,doctor,"Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?"
89,RES,patient,"Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?"
89,RES,patient,"I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it."
89,RES,doctor,Do you take any puffers for your COPD?
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to."
89,RES,doctor,OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, sure, Yep."
89,RES,patient,So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.
89,RES,doctor,"Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
89,RES,doctor,And are you allergic to anything?
89,RES,patient,"No, not that I know."
89,RES,doctor,Any family history of lung conditions?
89,RES,patient,"Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so."
89,RES,doctor,OK. How about heart conditions?
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s."
89,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, any cancers?"
89,RES,patient,My uncle had skin cancer.
89,RES,doctor,"OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?"
89,RES,patient,"No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away."
89,RES,doctor,"Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?"
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, how much do you smoke?"
89,RES,patient,Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.
89,RES,doctor,"Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?"
89,RES,patient,"Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?"
89,RES,patient,"Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey."

89,RES,doctor,"OK, and where do you live right now?"
89,RES,patient,Right now I live in a small bungalow in London.
89,RES,doctor,"OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?"
89,RES,patient,"Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?"
89,RES,patient,"No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home."
89,RES,doctor,"OK, how about travel to anywhere?"
89,RES,patient,"Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic."
89,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
89,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before."
89,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?"
89,RES,patient,Thank you.
89,RES,doctor,OK yeah no problem.
90,RES,doctor,Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?
90,RES,patient,"Yeah, absolutely. Uhm, I don't know, I've just been feeling a little feverish, uhm, and I also have a, a bit of a sore throat."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, when..."
90,RES,patient,"I just came in, I just came in to see what's going on, cause I was worried, you know, with covid going on, uhm, going everywhere."
90,RES,doctor,"Certainly, when did the, the sore throat start?"
90,RES,patient,Last night actually.
90,RES,doctor,OK.
90,RES,patient,Yeah.
90,RES,doctor,"And uhm, have you had any, uhm, problems with swallowing, like food or liquids?"
90,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. I just had breakfast this morning and no problems there."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, any like, changes that, uhm, other symptoms that you've been having with the sore throat?"
90,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'm just feeling a little feverish."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did that start?"

90,RES,patient,"Yeah, I don't, uh, yes, I said I was eating breakfast this morning, but it just tasted really bland."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, so maybe loss of taste, so you feel like your nose is really or that you're really congested?"
90,RES,patient,"I guess yeah, now that I think about it."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, and how has your appetite been?"
90,RES,patient,It's alright.
90,RES,doctor,"OK, and so you haven't had any cough or shortness of breath, but have you noticed any wheezing?"

90,RES,patient,"I'd say this morning as well, yesterday was just like a little tickle in my throat and I thought it would just go away you know, and I woke up this morning and I just felt horrible. And the sore throat was just worse and I felt feverish and tired and I felt really crappy."
90,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, and have you had any symptoms like this before?"
90,RES,patient,"Well yeah, I usually get a cold once a year in the fall. It does feel similar to that."
90,RES,doctor,OK.
90,RES,patient,"But I still wanted to be careful and come in, just in case."
90,RES,doctor,"yeah, certainly. Have you had, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?"
90,RES,patient,I have migraines.
90,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you taking any medications regularly?"
90,RES,patient,"No, no, I'm not. It's not bad. I sometimes just take like, Advil whenever my headache's coming on."
90,RES,doctor,OK. Any allergies?
90,RES,patient,"Uh, nope."
90,RES,doctor,OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
90,RES,patient,"I smoke, uh, two or three a day."

90,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and, uhm, OK, yeah, I think that's all I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me or maybe that I forgot to ask about?"
90,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so. Do you think I have covid?"
90,RES,doctor,"It's, it's certainly possible. It will be something we test for."
90,RES,patient,Sure.
90,RES,doctor,"Although the symptoms that you're experiencing, with feeling or having a fever, sore throat, and not feeling well with the muscle aches and fatigue, uhm, its relatively non-specific, so as you mentioned, it could be something like the common cold, that you've experienced in the past, so we can't rule that out either at this time, but we will do some investigations including a nasal swab for covid and kind of go from there."
90,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
90,RES,doctor,"All right, we'll get that started."
90,RES,patient,Great.
91,MSK,doctor,What brings you here today?
91,MSK,patient,"I just had uh, well, it was just uh, I came from football practice I, uh, just felt like somebody fell on me while, like while I was on the ground and it's like, I've had this shoulder pain immediately afterwards and I can see a, like lump, um, kind of pointing out like in my skin here on my, on my, um, clavicle or shoulder bone."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, is it the right side or the left side?"
91,MSK,patient,"Uh, it's the right side."
91,MSK,doctor,"The right side, okay. Um, okay, and how long ago did this happen?"
91,MSK,patient,"It happened about, just a couple of hours ago. Yeah, just about 2 hours ago."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um. Um, did someone, did someone fall onto your side? Okay, uh, so, your main, are you having mainly pain in that, in that area, or is it going to other places?"
91,MSK,patient,It's mostly just the pain like right in that area. I'm not feeling it anywhere else.
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and um, what kind of pain are you feeling? Is it sharp, stabbing, or is it aching?"
91,MSK,patient,"It's really sharp. It feels like I'm, I'm getting stabbed in the shoulder."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, I see, and on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?"
91,MSK,patient,"Uh, this is like a 10. It hurts really bad."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and um, are able to do any movements, or are you just kind of holding your arm up with your other other arm?"
91,MSK,patient,"I, yeah I've just been holding my arm up by, uh, I kind of made a sling out of, yeah, like the coaches helped make a sling out of one of the, uh, what we, like a shirt or something like that at the practice. And so I've been just kind of holding my arm against my chest with my elbow flexed. I haven't really moved it at all."
91,MSK,doctor,"I see, okay. Um, and if you were to describe just what it looks like right now, does your shoulder kind of seem like it's sagging?"
91,MSK,patient,Yeah it does.
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and do you notice any point near your shoulder like clavicle area that has any bruising, swelling looks, like red? Anything like that?"

91,MSK,patient,"Um, yeah, I'll take like uh, just some allergy medication every once in a while. When it's like, just seasonal allergies, I think to just some environmental triggers is all."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and and do you have any allergies to any medications at all?"
91,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, I don't believe so."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, anything that you've tried that has helped or made your pain worse?"
91,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't, I haven't taken anything yet, I just uh, like basically came right from practice to the, to the hospital."

91,MSK,patient,No.
91,MSK,doctor,"Any skin changes, like rashes?"
91,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't had any rashes."

91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright, and um, do you work currently? Or are you a student?"
91,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I'm in high school and, um, I, I work part-time at the grocery store as well, but uh, it's not that often though, because I've just been been playing sports, on the football team, we have a lot of practices and games and stuff."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, do you drink alcohol?"
91,MSK,patient,"Uh I, sometimes I, with friends. Um, we've had a couple of beers here and, here and there, but I mean it's, it's not something that I've done very often. Yeah, we've been pretty safe, I feel like."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and do you smoke cigarettes or marijuana, or use any recreational drugs?"
91,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
91,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination of the area. Um, we, we will definitely get an x-ray of the shoulder and clavicle to see what kind of, it seems like you have a clavicular fracture from just the mechanism of the injury, as well as everything you were describing. Um, but it is important to understand how, like what kind of clavicle injury it is and where it's affected, if it's in the middle area, on like the outer areas of the clavicle, um, and how much it's displaced because that will determine if we just need to reduce it here, and then give you a sling, and then you can go home. That's usually the case, but sometimes you may require surgery as well, and we would need to refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. So yeah, we'll, we'll get the x-ray done, and if you need anything for pain currently, we will give you some medications here, um and then we'll go from there."
91,MSK,patient,"Alright, thank you."
91,MSK,doctor,"You're welcome. Um, I'll be here with you shortly."
91,MSK,patient,That sounds good. Thank you so much.
92,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
92,MSK,patient,"Um I'm here because I've had some numbness in my right hand and uh doesn't seem to be going going away, so I thought I should get it checked out by you."
92,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly so, so when did this exactly start?"
92,MSK,patient,"Um so it's been pretty gradual, I would say over the past month or two months um is when I first noticed it, but the numbness is definitely worse now than it was at the start."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, and uh where is this um the pain and numbness, where are you feeling it exactly?"
92,MSK,patient,"Um it's particular, it's the worst on my thumb and index finger."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, do you feel it on your ring finger or uh, or sorry or your middle finger?"
92,MSK,patient,"Um there is a little bit on my middle and ring finger, but it's like it's very very mild."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uh, and uh, like how long, is, are the symptoms constant or or are they intermittent?"
92,MSK,patient,"Um I would say it's somewhat constant, but it's worse when um when I'm trying to like hold the steering wheel or using my phone, or you know, reading a book."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see, and um is there anything that you do uh at those times, to try to help get the symptoms to go away?"
92,MSK,patient,"Um I guess I like shake out my hand um or yeah, try to put pressure on those numb, numb areas."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, does flicking the the wrist or anything like that, does it help?"
92,MSK,patient,Uh maybe slightly.
92,MSK,doctor,"OK. And uh like how would you describe the the pains in your hand, like dull, achy, sharp?"
92,MSK,patient,"I would say the pain is more like a tingling sensation. Um so I guess the tingling is is like a sharp feeling, um I wouldn't call it so much pain as I would just like tingling and numbness."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, and uh is is there anything, so you mentioned sort of the driving and using your phone, are there any other activities that make it worse?"
92,MSK,patient,"Recently I found it's hard for me to hold things um in my right hand, so like if I'm trying to open up a jar um like it's hard for me to hold it, and sometimes I find uh like it'll just fall out of my hand."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you're like dropping items and stuff?"
92,MSK,patient,"Mhmm, yes."
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you feel any, uh, like the numbness or tingling, does it radiate anywhere? Like to your forearm or up into your like upper arm or shoulder?"

92,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you're positive Tinel's test, and um if you kind of place your wrist so that um like the backs of your hands are facing each other so that your wrists are flexed downwards and your um, your wrists are flexed and your fingers are pointing towards the ground and you just hold that position for a period of time. Um do you feel any pain?"
92,MSK,patient,Uh I guess a little bit of tingling.
92,MSK,doctor,"OK, so that would be a positive Phalen's test as well. Um and range of motion of the neck, do you have any problems with that or any pain there?"
92,MSK,patient,No.
92,MSK,doctor,OK. Um I think that was everything I wanted to ask about and check on the exam. Did you have any questions for me?
92,MSK,patient,"Um no, no questions. Thank you so much."
92,MSK,doctor,"Alright, you're welcome, yeah, so it sounds like this could be uh carpal tunnel syndrome and uh so we we may depending on uh kind of like nerve studies to confirm the diagnosis, and um things that you can do in the meantime would be to use like a splint or um yeah, try to use like nighttime splints and activity modification as well."
92,MSK,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good."
93,MSK,doctor,What brings you here today?
93,MSK,patient,"Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?"
93,MSK,patient,"For the past week,"
93,MSK,doctor,"Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?"
93,MSK,patient,"Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and where is this pain located exactly?"
93,MSK,patient,"Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?"
93,MSK,patient,"So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain."
93,MSK,doctor,"Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?"
93,MSK,patient,Uh any movement.
93,MSK,doctor,OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?
93,MSK,patient,"Um I think um, like no, anything hurts."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?"
93,MSK,patient,I'd give it about a 7.
93,MSK,doctor,"Seven, OK."
93,MSK,patient,Yeah.
93,MSK,doctor,"And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, so just just in the area that you described?"
93,MSK,patient,Yes.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?"
93,MSK,patient,"No, I don't see anything like that."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?"
93,MSK,patient,"Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy?"
93,MSK,patient,"Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that."
93,MSK,doctor,"I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?"
93,MSK,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?"
93,MSK,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, any numbness or tingling?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,Any weakness in your extremities?
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?"
93,MSK,patient,Yes.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?"
93,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah I would say so."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?"
93,MSK,patient,It's pretty much there all day.
93,MSK,doctor,OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
93,MSK,patient,"Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you take any medications?"
93,MSK,patient,I'm on metformin.
93,MSK,doctor,OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?
93,MSK,patient,"No, no allergies to medications."
93,MSK,doctor,Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?"
93,MSK,patient,Yes.
93,MSK,doctor,"And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?"
93,MSK,patient,"I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well."
93,MSK,patient,OK.
93,MSK,doctor,"Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?"
93,MSK,patient,Um I live by myself right now.
93,MSK,doctor,Do you live in a house or apartment?
93,MSK,patient,Um I live in an apartment.
93,MSK,doctor,"And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?"
93,MSK,patient,"Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?"
93,MSK,patient,"Uh no, no."
93,MSK,doctor,"How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?"
93,MSK,patient,I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?"
93,MSK,patient,I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, but otherwise it's not tender?"
93,MSK,patient,No.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?"
93,MSK,patient,Yeah.
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?"
93,MSK,patient,The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.
93,MSK,doctor,Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?
93,MSK,patient,"It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts."
93,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better."
93,MSK,patient,OK.
93,MSK,doctor,"Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder."
93,MSK,patient,OK.
93,MSK,doctor,"For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?"
93,MSK,patient,That sounds pretty good. Thank you.
93,MSK,doctor,"Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there."
93,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good."
94,RES,doctor,So what brings you in here today?
94,RES,patient,So I've had this stuffy nose for the past three days. I'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose. I can't seem to smell well. And I have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?"
94,RES,patient,"So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts. It's not even like, it's not like a headache, it's like a facial pressure"
94,RES,doctor,OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?
94,RES,patient,"No, never."
94,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow, how much of the discharge are you having like in a day?"
94,RES,patient,Like probably enough to fill the inside of my palm.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?"
94,RES,patient,"Uh, no,  nothing like that. I did have what they thought was a viral infection a week back."
94,RES,doctor,"OK. And did you recover from it, like on your own?"
94,RES,patient,"Yeah, it went away on its own."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, so it was just, you just had some cold-like symptoms?"

94,RES,doctor,Any loss of sense of taste or smell?
94,RES,patient,I guess loss of smell.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and did that come after the congestion or was it present before?"
94,RES,patient,The loss of smell came after the congestion.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and would you say you're still pretty congested?"
94,RES,patient,"I think so, yeah."
94,RES,doctor,OK. And has it been getting worse would you say? Or do you feel that it's getting better?
94,RES,patient,"Um, I would say it's getting worse."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you? Is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion?"
94,RES,patient,It's the...it's the pressure in my face. It hurts.
94,RES,doctor,"Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?"
94,RES,patient,I tried some nasal sprays. And like decongestions but it's not really helping.
94,RES,doctor,"OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays? Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?"
94,RES,patient,"Yeah, and they don't seem to be helping."
94,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. Any recent contact with anyone who's been ill or any recent travel?"

94,RES,patient,"Uh, I would say for the past three days?"
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you feel that, you know you're having some discharge, but do you feel that there is mucous building up and dripping down your throat or anything like that?"
94,RES,patient,"Yeah, now that you mention it, it does feel like that."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?"
94,RES,patient,"Oh gosh, I hope not, no. No one said that."
94,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well. So yeah, just wondering. Any chest pain at all?"
94,RES,patient,"No, no chest pain."
94,RES,doctor,Constipation or diarrhea?
94,RES,patient,No.
94,RES,doctor,Any issues with urinating?
94,RES,patient,"No, no issues there."
94,RES,doctor,Any changes in your sleep or appetite?
94,RES,patient,"Well, I guess sleeping is a little bit harder now because of the pressure in my face, but other than that, no."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?"
94,RES,patient,"Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?"
94,RES,patient,"Yeah, the last three days, last three days."
94,RES,doctor,OK. Do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past?

94,RES,patient,"I just have some, I just have some seasonal allergies."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"
94,RES,patient,"Uh, no, actually I had my appendix taken out when I was 12."
94,RES,doctor,"OK. Right, and do you have any family history of any conditions, like any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers?"
94,RES,patient,"Um, I know that there's some asthma that runs in the family."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma?"
94,RES,patient,No.
94,RES,patient,I live in a house with my husband and my 3 year old daughter.
94,RES,doctor,OK. And do you currently smoke cigarettes?
94,RES,patient,No.
94,RES,doctor,Do you drink alcohol?
94,RES,patient,I don't.
94,RES,doctor,Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
94,RES,patient,"Um, I'll smoke a joint or two once a week."
94,RES,doctor,"Ok, a joint or two, OK. And is that, is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms?"
94,RES,patient,"Uh, that's just recreationally."
94,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?"
94,RES,patient,"Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?"
94,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?"
94,RES,patient,"No, I haven't."
94,RES,doctor,"OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin."
94,RES,patient,Sure.
94,RES,doctor,"So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?"
94,RES,patient,"I haven't, I haven't, no."
94,RES,doctor,OK.
94,RES,patient,I don't feel hot though.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?"
94,RES,patient,Yeah that sounds great. Thank you.
94,RES,doctor,"OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better."
94,RES,patient,Thank you.
94,RES,doctor,Take care.
94,RES,patient,You too.
95,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
95,RES,patient,"Hi, uhm, I've just been a little bit worried, that last the couple of months I've noticed that I've been getting more and more out of breath when I've been doing exercise, and I know I got a brother who had a heart issue and I'm just really concerned that I have something wrong with my ticker, just wanted to get it checked out, you know?"
95,RES,doctor,"Uhm, when did the shortness of breath start?"
95,RES,patient,"So, this winter specifically, like we haven't been too active because of Covid this year, we've just been staying in the house all last year, but with the snow, I'd be shovelling snow whenever it fell and before I could be able to like 2 years ago be able to clear the driveway, no problem, but now even after half the driveway I've noticed I'm getting consisntely out of breath, I've got this nasty cough and it's prompted my wife to get me to call in, she's a little bit worried."
95,RES,doctor,"So it's mostly on exertion, it doesn't happen at rest, is that correct?"
95,RES,patient,"Being out of breath? No, no."
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK, ok. And has this ever happened to you before?"
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, about a year and a half ago we went down to Toronto, in order to see the CN tower, and you know, do tourist stuff and we tried we tried to climb a couple flights of stairs to do a little bit, and I could not, I always thought I'm pretty healthy, pretty active but it really took the wind out of my sails, so had to stop, stoop over. Just couldn't do it."
95,RES,doctor,"Uhm, and how did you manage like how, how was that treated at that time and how did you get better?"
95,RES,patient,"Oh, I didn't do any. I just attributed to being, I don't know, out of shape a little bit and I worked as a mechanic when I was younger. I was pretty active, but ever since retiring thought I'd keep up, at least my stamina won't go away that quickly, but chalked it up to being out of shape and went home."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, so your symptom, your shortness of breath seems to be getting worse, right?"
95,RES,patient,Yeah.
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any coughing with that?"
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah. And not necessarily when I noticed it when I was shovelling the driveway. But I've had a call for the last couple of years and usually in the morning I just bring up a little bit of gunk, but most of my buddies have that, just like a morning cough, you know?"
95,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and the gunk that you bring up. What color is it?"
95,RES,patient,"Uh, yellow, sometimes a little brown."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did that start?"
95,RES,patient,"Oh, it's been going on last 10 years. Well, to be honest since I've been like 30, but it's been fairly consistent, last 10 years I'd say."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any blood that you bring up?"
95,RES,patient,"Not that I've noticed, like bright red? No, nothing like that."
95,RES,doctor,OK. Any wheeziness?
95,RES,patient,"Yeah yeah, I noticed that when I was showing, yeah when I was out of breath, it sound sounded different sound different than being usually out of breath but it had to. It sounded wheezy."
95,RES,doctor,OK. Any chest pain?
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, a little bit actually."
95,RES,doctor,"Uhm, at rest or?"
95,RES,patient,"Nothing, nothing when I'm not moving."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, so the chest pain, when did that start?"
95,RES,patient,"First noticed it this winter on the driveway but it wasn't like I know what they say about a heart attack, supposed to like, the crushing pain in your chest that moves up your neck. Nothing like that. It's like my lungs, my throat. Like you're really, really out of breath, you know?"
95,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're attributing it mostly to your shortness of breath then?"
95,RES,patient,I think so. I really hope this is my heart. I've never had a heart attack.
95,RES,doctor,"Yeah. Where in your chest is this chest pain happening like is it central? Is it more towards the left, towards the right?"
95,RES,patient,It was kind of both sides.
95,RES,doctor,OK.
95,RES,patient,"It was, Was we all across my chest, to be honest it was only the one time that was really struggling and I coughed up a bit, but yeah."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any pain in your calves or legs, well after you walk a certain distance?"
95,RES,patient,"No, no."
95,RES,doctor,No. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?
95,RES,patient,"Felt like my heart was racing after that much activity, but no, not usually."
95,RES,doctor,OK. How about swelling in your limbs?
95,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any fainting spells or dizziness?"
95,RES,patient,No never fainted in my life.
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Any confusion, memory loss?"
95,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
95,RES,doctor,Headaches?
95,RES,patient,"Headaches, you know I do get headaches from time to time. I associate them with stress, but I haven't been too stressed out recently so nothing in the last couple of years."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any neck stiffness?"
95,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Any sensitivity to light or loud sounds associated with that headache?"
95,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss?"
95,RES,patient,"No, I wish."
95,RES,doctor,OK. Fevers?
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,Rashes?
95,RES,patient,"You know I got these weird things on my head. I think mainly because of the sun. Like these brown patches, but that wouldn't be a rash, would it?"
95,RES,doctor,"I'd have to examine that closer. If you think it's associated with the sun, it could be something like seborrheic keratosis, but I'd have to see what they look like so we can take a look at that later, if that's OK. And so any changes in your vision or hearing?"
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,"No. Stuffy nose, runny nose?"
95,RES,patient,"Had a bit of a cold couple months ago, but no, nothing recent."
95,RES,doctor,Sore throat?
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, a little bit after the cough. I had a little bit of a sore throat but went away pretty quickly."
95,RES,doctor,OK. Change in smell or taste?
95,RES,patient,I haven't been able to smell or taste too well for awhile.
95,RES,doctor,What's awhile?
95,RES,patient,"Ten years, seven years it's been more salt, more spices on my food, you know."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Any changes to your bowel habits?"
95,RES,patient,"Nope, been regular all my life."
95,RES,doctor,"Nausea, vomiting?"
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Joint pain, muscle aches?"
95,RES,patient,"You know my knees been giving me trouble for awhile, but nothing recent, no."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy?"
95,RES,patient,"No, got high blood pressure. See the doc about that. Uhm, high cholesterol, see the doc about that. And yeah, I don't know. Got into a car crash my 40s. Broke my arm one time. Nothing else really."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any surgeries?"
95,RES,patient,"Uh, I think I had my appendix out when I was, yeah I had my appendix out when I was like 12."
95,RES,doctor,OK.
95,RES,patient,Never been under the knife since then.
95,RES,doctor,"OK, great. Have you been taking any medications for that high blood pressure?"
95,RES,patient,Yeah doc's got me on two blood pressure medications and one cholesterol medication.
95,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you take those frequently?"
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, everyday."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Any other medications?"
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,Are you up to date with all your immunizations?
95,RES,patient,"Jeez, been a while since I've gotten immunization. Think, I think so."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Once you turn 65, they usually give you shing-shingrex for, to prevent shingles and a pneumovax vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infections. Have you had those ones?"
95,RES,patient,Nope.
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK. So if you're interested in getting those, we can discuss that at some point today as well,"
95,RES,patient,OK.
95,RES,doctor,Do you have any allergies?
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Any, OK, so you mentioned a family history of your brother having congenital heart disease. Any other heart diseases that run in the family?"
95,RES,patient,Congenital. What's that mean?
95,RES,doctor,Like something that you're born with.
95,RES,patient,"No, I don't think he's ever born thing he had a couple of heart attacks."
95,RES,doctor,Oh heart attacks. OK sorry I must have misinterpreted that. How old was he when he had his first heart attack?
95,RES,patient,"He's older me by five years, but he had the first one when he was younger than I am now. Like 62 was the first one, another one at 65."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, did, is he, did they ever find a cause for his heart attack? Is he a healthy person?"
95,RES,patient,"Healthy, he's healthy. I you know I wouldn't call him too healthy of a guy either. He's a hard liver, let's call him that. I have why it happened, I think, obviously it's his diet man. He's like a hog. Steaks, butter, bacon I'm  assuming that's what did him in."
95,RES,doctor,"Oh yikes, OK. OK, uh any other heart conditions that run in the family or other members of the family experiencing heart attacks?"
95,RES,patient,"Yep, dad died young from a high heart attack. He was, he died younger than I am now. He passed away at 66."
95,RES,doctor,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
95,RES,patient,"Oh it's been years now. It is what it is. His grandmother had a stroke. High blood pressure on my mom side. High cholesterol on my mom side too. But yeah, awful heart attacks on my father side of the family."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Any other lung, any lung conditions that run in the family?"
95,RES,patient,None that come to mind.
95,RES,doctor,OK and do you smoke?
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah I smoke."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, how much do you smoke?"
95,RES,patient,"I cut it back, about half a pack a day for the last two years now."
95,RES,doctor,OK and before that?
95,RES,patient,"I was pretty much a pack a day. Maybe, well, when it was bad, 2 packs a day, but I've been smoking yeah, since about, when do they start working at the shop, like 17, everyone there smokes."
95,RES,doctor,"Oh OK Wow yeah well then but it's good that you cut down, that's good. Do you, do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything?"
95,RES,patient,"I'll smoke weed at the shop every Friday, but I'm not huge fan of it to be honest."
95,RES,doctor,OK. And how much do you smoke every Friday?
95,RES,patient,"Both are about four joints, seven people, so I don't know what that is. Half a gram?"
95,RES,doctor,"Half a joint? OK, yeah. OK, and do you drink?"
95,RES,patient,Oh yeah.
95,RES,doctor,How much do you drink?
95,RES,patient,"See, Christmas was about the last time I went out like a beer or two. Uhm, weekends but when families in town will we'll go whole hog. I'll drink maybe 20 beer."
95,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, OK. And yeah you should, have you thought about cutting that down?"
95,RES,patient,"You gotta keep up with the family, you know, you can't let them embarrass you like that."
95,RES,doctor,"Let's, I understand that, but also you know, it's important to take care of your health and slow and steady wins the race, right?"
95,RES,patient,"I'll keep that in mind, doc, I'll keep that in mind."
95,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and how's your diet?"
95,RES,patient,"Been pretty good. The wife's been on a, on a health food craze last five years. Vegetables, I don't know, I eat whatever she cooks, basically."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm that's good, and in terms of exercise, do you get to move around?"
95,RES,patient,"I used to be pretty active. I used to bike around, but 'cause of Covid I've just been indoors all this time. So no, not much."
95,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, well it's good to go out for a walk once in awhile. I think that's allowed during Covid as long as you're being safe. And who do you live with at home?"
95,RES,patient,I live with my wife.
95,RES,doctor,"OK, any children?"
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've got three kids, one for my first marriage, two with the Mrs. right now."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you get to see them often?"
95,RES,patient,"Yeah, daughter lives in town and get to see her and grand kid a bit, the other boy works in Fort Mac and my oldest son, he's out east."
95,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and have you had any contact with people who've been sick recently?"
95,RES,patient,"No, we've been keeping entirely to ourselves. You can get our groceries ordered to the house."
95,RES,doctor,OK. And how about travel? Any recent travel?
95,RES,patient,No.
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Uhm, and then lastly, just wanted to ask you because you have been smoking for a long time, have you ever been diagnosed with something called COPD?"
95,RES,patient,Doesn't ring a bell.
95,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Have you ever had any pulmonary function tests or chest x-rays done in the past?"
95,RES,patient,"Chest x-ray, I think they did a chest x-ray after the car crash."
95,RES,doctor,OK.
95,RES,patient,"But I can't think of getting one recently, no."
95,RES,doctor,OK. Alright well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?
95,RES,patient,"So this is a hard, like, should I be worried?"
95,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you know what? It sounds from what you're telling me, it sounds like you have shortness of breath on exertion, and it sounds like you have a cough with still producing some phlegm. It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now, but of course we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff. But right now, I'm thinking it could be something called COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder because of your smoking history. Uhm, so we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest x-ray, and I we'll try to go from there. If it is COPD we'll likely put you on a, like a puffer for that. A like a lot a short or long acting beta agonist, that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is. How does that sound?"
95,RES,patient,"Sounds great, doc. Thanks a million."
95,RES,doctor,"Alright, great thank you."
95,RES,patient,Have a good one.
96,RES,doctor,What can I do for you?
96,RES,patient,"I've been feeling really, just, bad these last couple of days. I've had these, uh, muscle aches and headache and cough that have been really bothering me."
96,RES,doctor,When did all this start?
96,RES,patient,"So yeah, about 3 days ago I woke up in the morning with, uh, and yeah, I started having these, like muscle aches and a cough started kind of that day."
96,RES,doctor,"OK, can you tell me a little bit more about the cough? Is it a dry cough or wet cough?"
96,RES,patient,"It's a dry cough, I haven't brought up any any sputum and no blood."
96,RES,doctor,"And the muscle aches, is it all over? is it specific part of your body?"
96,RES,patient,"Yeah, It's just kinda all over, just feels kind of icky."
96,RES,doctor,"OK, and has the cough gotten better or worse over the past three days?"
96,RES,patient,"It's got a little worse. I think I would say it's a bit more frequent. But the cough isn't that bad, but it's gotten worse."
96,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned headaches. When did those start?"
96,RES,patient,"So within the last couple of days, yeah, I've had a headache, want to say, most of the time. And I've been using Tylenol or Acetaminophen to help with those. Its taken the edge off of the headaches, for sure."
96,RES,doctor,Do you usually get headaches?
96,RES,patient,"Every once in a while, maybe once or twice a month, maybe even less than that."
96,RES,doctor,Is your current headache similar to the headaches that you usually get?
96,RES,patient,"It is, yeah, it's yeah, It feels like my head is being squeezed and I kind of have a pressure, where yeah, that kind of squeezing sensation on my forehead."
96,RES,doctor,"That front part, both sides, left and right?"
96,RES,patient,"Yeah, kind of both sides."
96,RES,doctor,"Is it accompanied with, uh, so is the headache worse when you're in bright light?"
96,RES,patient,No.
96,RES,doctor,"No, OK, is it worse when, are you trying to stay in a dark room with no sound? Is it worse when you're, when people are talking or there's loud noises around you?"
96,RES,patient,No.
96,RES,doctor,"No, any nausea or vomiting?"
96,RES,patient,No.
96,RES,doctor,Any stiffness in your neck? Any difficulties moving your neck?
96,RES,patient,"No, that's OK, I mean a bit, like I don't know, like, kind of achy I guess with my upper back and shoulders feel a bit sore but, yeah I can move my head around ok."
96,RES,doctor,"Alright, OK and, uhm, let's see. So have you had any fevers or chills?"

96,RES,patient,"No, I just use the Tylenol, and I took a Tylenol cold and sinus at night, which helped with the sleeping."
96,RES,doctor,"OK, can you tell me if you have any medical problems, any medical conditions?"
96,RES,patient,"Yeah I have, uh, high cholesterol and yeah, I just have high cholesterol."
96,RES,doctor,Any medications that you're on?
96,RES,patient,"Yeah, I take a statin."

96,RES,patient,I know my dad had a stroke when he was in his late 70s and my mom had high cholesterol as well.

96,RES,doctor,Are you vaccinated?
96,RES,patient,"No, not yet."
96,RES,doctor,"No, OK, alright, OK, so you've had this dry cough and muscle aches and headache for the past three days or so and your symptoms are getting a little bit worse or your cough's getting worse for the past three days. We're gonna, it could be that you have some sort of a viral infection like an upper respiratory infection but you might also or you could possibly have covid, so we'll do a covid test, and I just recommend that you stay hydrated and continue to eat and drink well and and monitor your symptoms. Take Tylenol, it sounds like Tylenol has been helping a little bit, continue to take Tylenol, get lots of rest and if you have any shortness of breath, or if you feel like your symptoms are getting worse call 911 for help if your concerned about your health at all. And we'll get a covid test set up for you."

97,RES,patient,"Uhm, no."
97,RES,doctor,"OK, so meeting all milestones and?"
97,RES,patient,Yeah.
97,RES,doctor,"OK. And in regards to, uhm, birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or, or at birth?"
97,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, nothing at birth or during pregnancy, but he did start having lots of respiratory infections, which is when the pediatrician did that test. I forget the name, for the test and then they were, uhm, the, uhm, he was found to have, CF."
97,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and does anybody in the home smoke?"
97,RES,patient,No.

97,RES,patient,"No, just been at home."
97,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and has anybody in the, else in the family have cystic fibrosis?"
97,RES,patient,"No, no, no, no one else does. But we got tested and we were both found, my, my husband and I were found out have the gene for it. We were carriers."
97,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, I see. And any, any heart conditions or, or other lung conditions that run in the family?"
97,RES,patient,"No, nothing else."
97,RES,doctor,"OK. And were there any other symptoms that, or anything else that you wanted to tell me that maybe I forgot to ask about?"
97,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, I was just, uh, I'm just worried about him, uhm about his fever specifically, it's been high and I know that usually when he has these hospitalizations, he presents pretty similarly. So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics."
97,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there."
97,RES,patient,"Ok, Ok, sounds good, thank you."
98,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
98,RES,patient,"Hi. Uh, I've just had this cough for the past week and I was worried I might have Covid so I just wanted to um I just wanted to be checked."

98,RES,doctor,Been there. OK.
98,RES,patient,"Yeah, I just get this itchy sort of uh like scratchy sensation in my throat. And then I just cough and um that makes it better."
98,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, uhm what, how would you describe your cough like is it barky? Is it harsh? Is it muffled?"
98,RES,patient,"Uhm no, I don't I don't think it's barky or harsh."
98,RES,doctor,"OK, and does anything make it better or worse like you know, like the cold air, laying down, at particular time of day?"
98,RES,patient,"Not really, I haven't uh, nothing's really helped. Um I also tried a cough syrup, um it didn't, it helped for a couple hours, but then it was back again. The cough was back again."
98,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
98,RES,patient,"Uh well, I I said yeah when I get a cold."

98,RES,doctor,"OK. Any old carpet, dust, mold, or asbestos in your home?"
98,RES,patient,Um not that I'm aware of.
98,RES,doctor,"No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
98,RES,patient,"Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid."
98,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril."
98,RES,patient,Sure.
98,RES,doctor,Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound?
98,RES,patient,Sounds great.
98,RES,doctor,"OK, great, thank you."
99,RES,doctor,Would you mind starting with telling me what I can help you with today?
99,RES,patient,"Yeah, um I haven't been feeling very well over the past two days. I have had this cough, I'm feeling very short of breath and I'm feeling very feverish as well."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, uh, have you checked your temperature?"
99,RES,patient,"No, I haven't actually checked it, but I'm just feeling hot and I'm having chills."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, were you having like night sweats as well?"
99,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, last night I did get sweaty."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, and when uh, when did you start feeling feverish?"
99,RES,patient,"Feverish, maybe around the same time like right after the cough and shortness of breath started, maybe like a day and a half ago."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay. It's um, so the cough started about a day and a half ago as well?"
99,RES,patient,Yes.
99,RES,doctor,"Okay. Uh, did you have a cough prior to this or is it new?"
99,RES,patient,It's new.
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, is it a dry cough? Or are you bringing up sputum or phlegm?"
99,RES,patient,"Um, it's uh yeah, it's um, it's dry most of the time, but once in a while I'll see some like yellow phlegm."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, have you noticed any blood?"
99,RES,patient,"No, no blood."
99,RES,doctor,"All right, and have you had any chest pain?"
99,RES,patient,"No chest, well actually, when I try to take a really deep breath in, it, it hurts, my chest hurts."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, where do you feel the pain?"
99,RES,patient,"Uh, it seems to be central on my chest."
99,RES,doctor,"Do you feel it radiating anywhere, like to your back or to either side?"
99,RES,patient,No.
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, how would you describe the pain? Like sharp, dull?"
99,RES,patient,"Um, it's pretty sharp when I take a deep breath in."
99,RES,doctor,"How long does the pain last for, and is there anything that you do that makes it go away?"
99,RES,patient,"It was like less than a minute um, and, and it goes away when I like, if I try not to take a deep breath in."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, so it sounds like that it, the, the breathing is a trigger there, when you're breathing in deeply."
99,RES,patient,Yeah.
99,RES,doctor,Alright. And have you had any wheeze?
99,RES,patient,"Uh, a little bit, yes."
99,RES,doctor,"Alright, and uh, is the wheeze new as well?"
99,RES,patient,"Um yes, that also started after the coughing and the shortness of breath."
99,RES,doctor,"Alright. And have you had any episodes of feeling like your heart's racing, or is it speeding really fast?"
99,RES,patient,No.

99,RES,patient,"Um, that started a little bit before the cough, actually."

99,RES,patient,Yeah.
99,RES,doctor,Okay. Have you had a sore throat?
99,RES,patient,No sore throat.

99,RES,doctor,"Okay, and what happened around that time, with the pulmonary embolism? Did you, was there a trigger, like a surgery around that time? Or were you immobilized or anything?"
99,RES,patient,"Yeah, they think it happened right after my um, gallbladder removal 'cause I was in the hospital for a while."

99,RES,patient,"Yeah, once every two weeks."

99,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you traveled anywhere outside of the city, or?"
99,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
99,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, so that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that uh, that you wanted to add?"
99,RES,patient,"No, those are all questions that I had. Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?"
99,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted."
99,RES,patient,"Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
99,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
100,RES,doctor,So what brings you in here today?

100,RES,patient,"Um, it's mostly like centre of my chest, like, close to my, like I'd say it's like it feels like, it's not my like, it doesn't feel like it's inside. It feels more like it's pushing up on, on my chest wall."

100,RES,patient,"Um, they're pretty constant."
100,RES,doctor,Okay. And are they getting worse at all?
100,RES,patient,"Uh, no it's not getting worse, it was just bad to start with and it's still bad."
100,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, is there anything that you've tried that helps you with your breathing or relieves your chest pain? Anything that works for you?"

100,RES,patient,"Um, yeah like what, do you think I have COVID?"
100,RES,doctor,"Yeah so, right now it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind. Um some of these symptoms, um the shortness of breath and fever, definitely can be COVID, and that's something that we are going to test you with, and that's something we test everyone with. Um, but because you're having shortness of breath, uh, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well. Uh you can potentially have pneumonia that's not COVID, it can be any other virus or bacteria, so we will get some blood work done, we'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well, um and then get a chest x-ray as well."
100,RES,patient,Okay.
100,RES,doctor,"And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer, if you need any antibiotics within the hospital, or you can take them at home. So yeah, we'll do a full physical examination and do all those tests and then go from there."
100,RES,patient,"Okay, that sounds great. Thank you."

101,RES,patient,No.
101,RES,doctor,"Okay, so it happened after you had woken up and gotten out of bed. And um, so, can you describe your cough a little bit? Is it wet or is it dry?"
101,RES,patient,"Um, it's just um, it's just a dry cough."
101,RES,doctor,"Okay, you're not bringing up any sputum or any other material?"
101,RES,patient,No.
101,RES,doctor,"And uh, are you coughing up any blood by any chance?"
101,RES,patient,No.
101,RES,doctor,"For the shortness of breath, can you describe it a little bit? Is it, are you having trouble taking deep breaths, or are you breathing faster? Can you describe it?"
101,RES,patient,"Yeah, I just feel like um, I'm getting out of breath really easily, just like um, walking even, walking to the kitchen from my bedroom, I'm getting short of breath and it, it just started yesterday morning, it's so odd."
101,RES,doctor,"Okay, and have you had anything like this happen before to you?"
101,RES,patient,No.
101,RES,doctor,"No. Were you doing anything before it started? Like were you doing any, any activities or any, are were you doing any exertions at all?"
101,RES,patient,"No, I was just uh, I, I slept in, I slept in a bit more than usual, um, and I was feeling quite um, drowsy. My, my doc increased my pain meds and I took the first dose um, yesterday night, um, I actually took an extra pill um, um, of the morphine um, and yeah, I don't know, maybe it, it's an allergic reaction to the morphine."
101,RES,doctor,Have you had any allergic reactions before?
101,RES,patient,No.
101,RES,doctor,"And so you took an extra morphine last night and then went to sleep. Um, did you wake up coughing or catching your breath or anything like that?"
101,RES,patient,"No, I actually, I ended up waking up at 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM, I was just very drowsy and uh, I think I, I think I might have taken a bit too much, I don't know. The, the arthritis pain was just killing me last night and I thought taking an extra pill would help."
101,RES,doctor,"And is this, are your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?"
101,RES,patient,"They're constant for the past two days. I've also noticed that I have, my breath just smells really bad. I don't know why."
101,RES,doctor,Is that something you noticed recently or in the last two days?
101,RES,patient,"Yeah, since yesterday. Actually, not even yesterday, this morning I would say."
101,RES,doctor,"This morning, okay. Um, and is there anything that makes your symptoms worse? Like does lying down make your symptoms worse?"
101,RES,patient,Not really.

101,RES,patient,"Um, breast cancer, my grandma had it."

101,RES,doctor,"And your dog, okay. And did your husband tell you anything, like that has changed in your behaviour at all uh, recently?"

101,RES,doctor,"Okay. And um, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"

101,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, how, how often would you say you use it?"
101,RES,patient,"Only when the pain gets uh, too bad, so maybe um, three or four times a month."
101,RES,doctor,"Okay, and do you use any alcohol?"
101,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, I'll, uh, I'll drink once a week, two glasses, two or three glasses of wine."
101,RES,doctor,"Um, any, alright, so I think that those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?"
101,RES,patient,"Um, no."
101,RES,doctor,"Okay, so yeah, definitely with the coughing and shortness of breath we will definitely get a COVID swab test done. Um, that should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then public health will contact you. Um, yeah, based on what you're telling me so far, we will definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals, and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?"
101,RES,patient,Yeah.
101,RES,doctor,"Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well."
101,RES,patient,Sure.
101,RES,doctor,"Alright, okay."
102,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
102,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, so I, I just came in because I've been having, for the last, I would say 2 weeks, just a lot of congestion in my nose and then I've also been feeling a lot of pressure in my head as well as just, around my jaws and my face overall."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, you said it started two weeks ago. Has it gotten better or worse, or been the same since then?"
102,RES,patient,"Um, I'd say it's pretty much been the same, except like the pressure's getting worse."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, and do you find that the pressure is worse when you're bending down, or um, yeah, when you're like squatting or sitting down?"
102,RES,patient,"Um, when I'm sitting down, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel like, for example, when I'm lying on one side, it gets really bad on that one side and I have to kind of switch over to the other side."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, alright. And uh, when did your headaches start?"
102,RES,patient,"Um it's, I guess it's not so much as a headache as just kind of um, just pain in and around the cheeks and just going up to my head. And it started about, I would say around 2 weeks ago."
102,RES,doctor,"Um, and do you have a stuffy nose?"
102,RES,patient,"Yeah, I definitely have a stuffy nose and it started, um, it sometimes gets like, like a runny nose as well."
102,RES,doctor,"Yeah, okay and what's the discharge like?"
102,RES,patient,Uh it's usually clear.
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, and do you have a cough?"
102,RES,patient,"No, no coughs."
102,RES,doctor,Sore throat?
102,RES,patient,No.
102,RES,doctor,"Um, and do you have any difficulties breathing?"
102,RES,patient,"Um, no, not that I've noticed. Sometimes when it gets really stuffy, I, uh, have to breathe through my mouth."
102,RES,doctor,"Yeah, I see. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?"
102,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
102,RES,doctor,"Any chest pain or any heart, um, palpitations?"
102,RES,patient,Nope.
102,RES,doctor,"Um, any pain in your belly?"
102,RES,patient,Uh nope.

102,RES,patient,No.

102,RES,doctor,Any muscle aches?
102,RES,patient,Nope.
102,RES,doctor,"Um, any fevers or chills?"
102,RES,patient,"No, not that I've noticed."

102,RES,patient,"No, no, I'm very like careful. Um, I barely go out."
102,RES,doctor,"Good, that's very good. Um are you, have you traveled anywhere outside the province?"
102,RES,patient,No.
102,RES,doctor,"Okay and um, do you currently work?"
102,RES,patient,"I work from home right now, um, I'm an accountant."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay and do you live with anyone else, or do you live alone?"
102,RES,patient,"Uh, so I live with my family. I live with my husband and um two daughters."
102,RES,doctor,Have any of them been sick recently?
102,RES,patient,"No, they've been fine."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, good. Um, and do you smoke?"
102,RES,patient,"No, not at all."
102,RES,doctor,Do you smoke marijuana or consume any recreational drugs?
102,RES,patient,"Probably the last time was in college, um for marijuana."
102,RES,doctor,"I see. Um, what about alcohol?"
102,RES,patient,"Alcohol, I'll probably have a glass of red wine a day."
102,RES,doctor,"Alright, okay. And um, have you, do you have any, um I guess carpets or, or um curtains or any sort of animals around, anything that might cause any kind of environmental allergies?"
102,RES,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, um alright. And do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?"
102,RES,patient,"No, I've been completely healthy."
102,RES,doctor,Any hospitalizations or surgeries?
102,RES,patient,"I did have a, um, c-section with both my, both my children."
102,RES,doctor,I see. Any complications after?
102,RES,patient,"No complications after. They were both healthy, I, I didn't have to stay in the hospital."
102,RES,doctor,"Great, great. Um and any allergies uh to medications, foods or environmental allergies?"
102,RES,patient,"Nope, not that I know of."
102,RES,doctor,"Any medications, including over the counter herbal medications?"
102,RES,patient,"I have uh, I do take uh, Tylenol cold in bed sometimes, to relieve some of the pain and pressure."
102,RES,doctor,"That's good, that's good. Is there anything else that makes the the pressure and the pain better?"
102,RES,patient,"Um, I have done those like, kind of those steam um, therapies. That sometimes helps."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?"
102,RES,patient,"Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it."
102,RES,doctor,"Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?"
102,RES,patient,"Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything."
102,RES,doctor,What about sense of taste?
102,RES,patient,"Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really."
102,RES,doctor,"I see, okay. Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
102,RES,patient,"Um my, my father did have a heart attack in his uh, I think it was late 50s, but he's well and alive right now, so he's fine."
102,RES,doctor,"Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do."
102,RES,patient,Okay.
102,RES,doctor,Do you have any questions for me?
102,RES,patient,"Uh no, that's all. Thank you so much."
102,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
103,RES,doctor,How can I help you?
103,RES,patient,"Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him."
103,RES,doctor,So what symptom is he experiencing now?
103,RES,patient,"Uhm so, he's just having this wheezing that just doesn't go away, like, I can actually hear it, it's frightening, he's having like he's having difficulties falling asleep, he's just been very irritable, uhm, he didn't go to school yesterday. It's just, yeah, it's just, it seems like, it's just, he's not eating well either."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, so yeah, it's been affecting, uh, sleep, appetite, his mood, has he been short of breath?"
103,RES,patient,"If he was like, he said that he was having some difficulty breathing, yeah."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, has he, uh, able to talk like in full sentences, like, how is he right now?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, he's  able to talk in full sentences but he just gets a little bit breathless when he's eating, which I think is probably why he's not eating much. But yeah, he's able to talk, he's not talking much either, just been like, just been in a mood, you know, he gets a little bit breathless when he's crying."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, I see, and, has he had a cough?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah he does, he does have a cough, yeah."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the cough start?"
103,RES,patient,I want to say about two days ago.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and has he been bringing up any sputum?"
103,RES,patient,No.

103,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned, uh, a wheeze, have you been able to hear a wheeze like this before?"
103,RES,patient,It's usually not this bad.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, has he been having any abdominal pain?"
103,RES,patient,No.
103,RES,doctor,Any nausea or vomiting?
103,RES,patient,No.

103,RES,doctor,"Alright, and has he had any muscle aches or joint pains?"
103,RES,patient,"Uh, he's just been, he's just been not, he's not been as active as he usually is, so I don't, he hasn't said that any anything in particular about muscle pains, but I don't know if he knows how to, you know? He's just been, yeah."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and two days ago, can you think of any triggers like, was there any exposure to dust or smoke or maybe even pets that could have brought this on?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, you know, if I think about it, he did go outside to play with his brother and, I don't know he might have got something out there maybe."
103,RES,doctor,"Yeah, uh, certainly possible and was it like a particularly cold day?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, it was a very windy, little bit chilly too."
103,RES,doctor,"And when, like, during the winter time, does cold air trigger attacks for Dave?"
103,RES,patient,Oh yeah.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about exercise?"
103,RES,patient,"No, I don't think, well, they went outside to play, so I mean he was, uhm, exercise does make it worse sometimes, so it could be that too."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and so, has dave been experiencing any other symptoms besides the the wheezing and the irritability and what you've described so far?"
103,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so, that's, I think that's it."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, you tried some inhalers, how often have you been using them?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, we used his blue inhaler about five times yesterday, and another two or three times earlier today."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you use a spacer?"
103,RES,patient,"Uhm, no we don't. I have to go get that and learn how to use it."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, for sure we can go through, Uh, the proper technique, throughout this visit as well, just to review that again."
103,RES,patient,I would love that.
103,RES,doctor,"That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?"
103,RES,patient,"No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, does he have one that he uses, once, like, he uses daily?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah the one that he uses, I think the orange one."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, so he does use a steroid inhaler?"
103,RES,patient,Yeah.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and does he have any allergies?"
103,RES,patient,"Uhm, no he doesn't."

103,RES,patient,Last year.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, has he ever needed to be hospitalized for one?"
103,RES,patient,"Oh no, no, nothing like that, he's a healthy kid."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good, has he had any surgeries before?"
103,RES,patient,No.
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and in regards to birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or with delivery?"
103,RES,patient,"Oh no, everything was normal. He was born via vaginal delivery and no complications. He was a healthy baby."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any concerns with growth or developmental milestones?"
103,RES,patient,"No, no, the doc was pretty happy when he did the regular, the checkup and yeah things are good with him, he's a good kid."
103,RES,doctor,"Awesome, OK, and could you tell me a little bit about the living situation, like who's the main caregiver and who he's living with?"
103,RES,patient,"Yeah, so he lives with me, his dad and his brother who is 2 years older and he's not going to school right now. We're just keeping him at home due to Covid and trying to do some home schooling. I'm a homemaker, so I do have enough time to spend time with him and his older brother and, yeah."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, has anybody in the home been sick, either his brother, yourself, or father?"
103,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and anybody, at work or any other places that you maybe traveled to, that, uh, been around anybody who's been sick?"
103,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, I don't think so. I don't think there was anyone that was sick."

103,RES,patient,"No, no. We're just staying at home."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, and are there any pets in the home?"

103,RES,doctor,"Alright, any carpets or like, uh, curtains or anything like that, covering the windows?"
103,RES,patient,"No, we got all those removed when he had his big exacerbation last year."
103,RES,doctor,"I see, OK, and does anybody smoke in the home, either cigarettes or marijuana?"
103,RES,patient,"Uhm, my husband smokes, but he smokes outside, he never smokes in front of the kids."

103,RES,patient,No
103,RES,doctor,Cystic fibrosis or anything like that?
103,RES,patient,"No no, no."
103,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, so was there any other, anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about or I'm missing that you'd like to add today?"
103,RES,patient,"No, I'm just worried that he's going to have a big asthma attack like last year, I just also want to make sure nothing else is going on and if he can be taken care of and he's just, he's feeling awful."
103,RES,doctor,"For sure, yeah, we'll, uh, check his his vital signs and do a physical exam. And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies."
103,RES,patient,Thank you so much doc.

104,RES,patient,No.
104,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, so were there any other symptoms or anything else that, that I may have forgot to ask about?"
104,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. It's just the, the difficulties with breathing and the swelling."
104,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so the first thing, I'll speak to your daughter and we will, uhm, get a look at some of the old or some of the reports from, uhm, over the last several months from, and from the cardiologist you see. But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing. And in the meantime, we'll wait for the investigations to come back."
104,RES,patient,"Sure, Thank you."
105,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
105,RES,patient,"So, just for the past, like 3 days I've been coughing. It's I I don't feel particularly sick. I'm just kind of dry like annoying call that won't go away and then today I took my temp in it It's pretty high. It was like 99 point like 9.

105,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well."
105,RES,patient,Oh ok.
105,RES,doctor,"And yeah, and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year, just so just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep.

106,RES,doctor,"OK, and how would you describe this cough? Is it barky? Is it harsh? Does it sound muffled?"
106,RES,patient,How I would say is that it's kind of like it's not too harsh. It's more like a wet cough. I'm definitely bringing up some some sputum.

106,RES,patient,"It's usually like a, uh like a white and sometimes like a little bit yellow as well."

106,RES,doctor,Are you concerned about that?
106,RES,patient,"Yeah, for sure."
106,RES,doctor,"Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?"
106,RES,patient,"OK, great. Thank you."
106,RES,doctor,Thank you.
107,MSK,doctor,What brings you here today?
107,MSK,patient,"Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how long has this been going on for?"
107,MSK,patient,"Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?"
107,MSK,patient,It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?
107,MSK,doctor,OK yeah yeah.
107,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so just just over there."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?"
107,MSK,patient,"Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?"
107,MSK,patient,I'd say like a 6.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?"
107,MSK,patient,Um it just stays there.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?"
107,MSK,patient,"I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped?"
107,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much."
107,MSK,doctor,"I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?"
107,MSK,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?"
107,MSK,patient,"So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that."
107,MSK,doctor,OK.
107,MSK,patient,"And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, so are you left handed?"
107,MSK,patient,Yes.
107,MSK,doctor,OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
107,MSK,patient,No.
107,MSK,doctor,"No, so you're healthy?"
107,MSK,patient,Yes.
107,MSK,doctor,Um do you take any medications on a regular basis?
107,MSK,patient,"Uh no, no."
107,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?"
107,MSK,patient,Um no allergies.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?"
107,MSK,patient,No.
107,MSK,doctor,"No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?"
107,MSK,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, um any cancers in the family?"
107,MSK,patient,"Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer."
107,MSK,doctor,OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?
107,MSK,patient,"Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?"
107,MSK,patient,"Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore."
107,MSK,doctor,"I see, and does that help though?"
107,MSK,patient,Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain?"
107,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?"
107,MSK,patient,Uh I live in an apartment by myself.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes?"
107,MSK,patient,"Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?"
107,MSK,patient,Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.
107,MSK,doctor,OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?
107,MSK,patient,Um I will take an edible like once a month.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?"
107,MSK,patient,"Um I can, but it hurts."
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?"
107,MSK,patient,Yes.
107,MSK,doctor,"How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?"
107,MSK,patient,It's just when I'm moving the thumb.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?"
107,MSK,patient,"Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist."
107,MSK,doctor,Does that hurt at all?
107,MSK,patient,No.
107,MSK,doctor,"OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm."
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,"And then hold your hand, sorry."
107,MSK,patient,"No, go ahead."
107,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb."
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,"Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers."
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,And then bring your uh arm out.
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,"And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground."
107,MSK,patient,"OK, yep."
107,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?"
107,MSK,patient,"Yes, that is very painful."
107,MSK,doctor,"That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint."
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,"And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb."
107,MSK,patient,OK.
107,MSK,doctor,"Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there."
107,MSK,patient,"OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
107,MSK,doctor,"Welcome, take care."
107,MSK,patient,You too.
108,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
108,RES,patient,"Hi, yes it's nice to meet you. I've been having this cough that's been going on for the last few days and I have had difficulty breathing."
108,RES,doctor,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?"
108,RES,patient,"Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?"
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough."
108,RES,doctor,So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?
108,RES,patient,"Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?"
108,RES,patient,"I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?"
108,RES,patient,It's dry. It's a dry cough.
108,RES,doctor,"OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?"
108,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better? Did you take anything? Any medications for it?"
108,RES,patient,I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help.
108,RES,doctor,"OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?"
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well."
108,RES,doctor,OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head."
108,RES,doctor,Have you had a headache like this before?
108,RES,patient,"I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,"
108,RES,doctor,Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped."
108,RES,doctor,"And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?"
108,RES,patient,"Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?"
108,RES,patient,"I haven't checked my temperature, but I felt like I've had a fever or might be getting a fever."
108,RES,doctor,We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I guess I felt a bit achy."
108,RES,doctor,Any redness in the eyes? Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?
108,RES,patient,"Umm, I have, I don't know maybe my nose is a little bit congested, but not really running."
108,RES,doctor,OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?
108,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed that."
108,RES,doctor,What about your sense of taste? Are you able to taste things?
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
108,RES,doctor,Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?
108,RES,patient,"Umm, no,  I haven't."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?"
108,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
108,RES,doctor,Any chest pain?
108,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any."
108,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?"
108,RES,patient,"No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?"
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think."
108,RES,doctor,"Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?"
108,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time."
108,RES,doctor,Do you have an inhaler?
108,RES,patient,I do but I don't use it very often.
108,RES,doctor,"I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?"
108,RES,patient,Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much.
108,RES,doctor,"Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?"
108,RES,patient,"Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago."
108,RES,doctor,Any reason for that?
108,RES,patient,"Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s."
108,RES,doctor,"I see OK, and any hospitalizations?"
108,RES,patient,No.
108,RES,doctor,"OK. Do you take any medications? I know you have puffers. Any medications, including over the counter pills?"
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'll take like a Zantac or like Tums sometimes for reflux."
108,RES,doctor,"And, uh, any allergies to food, medications, or environmental allergies?"
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have environmental allergies. I think like usually they come on in the springtime."
108,RES,doctor,"In terms of family histories, you did mention that your dad had colon cancer. Any other medical problems that that run in your family?"
108,RES,patient,"Umm, no."
108,RES,doctor,OK. And do you currently smoke?
108,RES,patient,"No, I don't and have never smoked in the past."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, what about marijuana?"
108,RES,patient,"Umm, no."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, do you or have you ever had alcohol?"
108,RES,patient,"I will have some wine on the weekends, maybe a glass or two with dinner."
108,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds good and have you ever had any street drugs?"
108,RES,patient,"Like a long time ago, maybe when I was in college, once or twice."
108,RES,doctor,"Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people? Anyone who's sick recently?"
108,RES,patient,"Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores. And I would imagine I were wearing a mask and of course trying to maintain social distancing as much as possible. But yeah, you never, really know."
108,RES,doctor,What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?
108,RES,patient,"Umm, no, I had been at home."
108,RES,doctor,Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?
108,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great."
108,RES,doctor,Thank you. OK alright.
109,RES,doctor,What brings you all in today?
109,RES,patient,"Essentially, when he, so today is Friday, when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick, so he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Um and then, yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, or sorry it's today, today is Friday, um, he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today. What was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was it was, it was like over 100 though."
109,RES,doctor,Oh OK.
109,RES,patient,"101 or something or maybe 100.1. But anyways, it was, so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something."
109,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. Um, OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days."
109,RES,patient,Mhmm.
109,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, so let's focus on the cough."
109,RES,patient,"Sorry, it's been more like 3 three days like Wednesday is when he came home and then, and then today's Friday, so yeah, sorry."
109,RES,doctor,"Today is Friday, OK. Um, OK, yeah sure. So, is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
109,RES,patient,"Ah I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Umm, yeah, he yeah, it's just been like little coughs."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and he, is he, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"
109,RES,patient,"No, no, not that I've noticed."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, how about short of breath?"
109,RES,patient,"Um, I don't think so like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also I think he's just been tired in general."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. OK, and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night in the morning?"
109,RES,patient,I think it kinda just there the whole day.
109,RES,doctor,"OK um. And does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Um, like harsh, what is, what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"
109,RES,patient,"Uh, I just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud."
109,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
109,RES,patient,"I don't like he's had colds before, but I haven't like, I haven't like you, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold."
109,RES,doctor,OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?
109,RES,patient,"I think so. Because yeah, he first day he just seemed like little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"
109,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."
109,RES,doctor,No OK. Does he have a sore throat?
109,RES,patient,I don't think so.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
109,RES,patient,"I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"
109,RES,patient,Maybe a bit of like a runny nose.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"
109,RES,patient,"Ah, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, how about vision or hearing?"
109,RES,patient,I think those are fine.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
109,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his bowel movements?"
109,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
109,RES,doctor,Pardon?
109,RES,patient,"I'm sorry, no changes."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool."
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his urine?"
109,RES,patient,"Really been looking, but I don't think so."
109,RES,doctor,Any dizziness or fainting spells?
109,RES,patient,"No, just like fatigue."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, any confusion or memory loss?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"And is he an, is he an otherwise healthy child?"
109,RES,patient,"Yeah, absolutely, he hasn't like decide to like vaccines, he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever. I mean, he broke his arm once but that was it."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm?"
109,RES,patient,"Exactly, like nothing."
109,RES,doctor,OK and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?
109,RES,patient,Yeah totally
109,RES,doctor,"OK. Ah, and then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"
109,RES,patient,"No, no, like everything was things really good."
109,RES,doctor,OK and then did he hit all his milestones? Up till now?
109,RES,patient,Yeah totally
109,RES,doctor,OK. And does he have any allergies?
109,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing, so far."
109,RES,doctor,Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
109,RES,patient,Yep.
109,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
109,RES,patient,"Uh, no, everyone is really healthy."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live?"
109,RES,patient,"He lives with me and my husband, and he has a little sister like just in town here."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, and is she healthy?"
109,RES,patient,"Yeah I like she, yeah she's healthy."
109,RES,doctor,"OK an any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"No OK, um has he been around any sick contacts recently?"
109,RES,patient,"Not not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say. They haven't like contacted us about anything."
109,RES,doctor,"OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"
109,RES,patient,No.
109,RES,doctor,"No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"
109,RES,patient,"I don't think so. Like I realized that I can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure."
109,RES,doctor,Mhmm.
109,RES,patient,"So yeah yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead."
109,RES,doctor,No go ahead.
109,RES,patient,"So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit."
109,RES,doctor,"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?"
109,RES,patient,"Yeah, sounds good."
109,RES,doctor,OK great.
109,RES,patient,Thank you.
109,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things"

We'll do a physical exam, see, just listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth and check your temperature and go from there.

111,RES,patient,"Uhm, I've been to the ER a couple of times and this one time, it was similar to this time, when I was having difficulties breathing and had to stay for about five days or so. I think that was two years ago."

111,RES,patient,"I wasn't producing this green yellow thing that's coming out of my mouth right now. It was not that bad. It's just last time I was having difficulties breathing, so I decided to come in. But this time I just have this weird thing, I don't even feel like looking at it."

111,RES,doctor,"Alright, and, so you've been experiencing worsening sputum production that now has a green color to it, and now having a bit more, more short of breath, which sounds like COPD exacerbation, especially since it's a similar type of presentation as before. And so we'll order a chest X-ray, some blood gases and do a sputum culture and possibly start antibiotics, but, depending on the severity we may not not need to just yet. And then we'll also use some inhalers as well as inhaled steroid to help with the inflammation in the airways."
111,RES,patient,Sure.
111,RES,doctor,"Alright, we'll get that started."
111,RES,patient,Thank you.
112,RES,doctor,What can I do for you?
112,RES,patient,"So I've been, just over the last week, I've been feeling pretty sick. I have this pretty bad headache that started like probably a week ago, and then for the last few days I've been having these chills. Um, and I didn't get a chance to measure my temperature at all, um, but the worst thing has been just these muscle aches all over my body, and that's been going on for the last three to four days."
112,RES,doctor,"Sorry to hear that you're feeling so, uh, horrible over the past week. Um let's uh, let's try to understand this a little bit better. So you've had this headache for the past week or so. Where exactly is it?"
112,RES,patient,"It's kind of just uh, all across my forehead. It's been going to the sides, like into my temples as well."
112,RES,doctor,"Okay, and what does it feel like? How would you describe it?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, it feels like, kind of like uh aching um, I, I have had headaches with throbbing before, but it's not so much throbbing it's more just constant, aching pain."
112,RES,doctor,"Um, if you had to give it a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst um, pain ever, what number would you give it?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh, probably like a 7."
112,RES,doctor,"Oh wow, yeah, that sounds severe. How long have you, how long has it been a 7 for?"
112,RES,patient,"Um, it's actually a bit better now, but yeah, like over the last week it's been a 7. I would say now, it's probably around 5."
112,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, anything that makes the headache better?"
112,RES,patient,"Um I, I take like Tylenol, then like, it gets relieved for a bit, for like a few hours, and then comes back."
112,RES,doctor,"Anything that you feel makes the headaches worse? Any postures, or positions, or activity or um, any kind of exposure to light or sounds?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh no it's, it's just kind of there. Nothing makes it worse."

112,RES,patient,"Uh it, it seems like it's on both sides."
112,RES,doctor,And have you noticed any visual changes? Any blurry vision with the headaches?
112,RES,patient,No.
112,RES,doctor,"Any other visual changes? No, okay. Um, and you've also had chills, but you said you haven't checked your temperature, right?"
112,RES,patient,"No, I haven't, uh, I've been having chills for the last few nights."
112,RES,doctor,"Yeah, we can definitely check your temperature here in the, um here. Um, and you mentioned that the muscle aches have been quite bothersome for you. Is it all over your body or anyone, uh, in any one muscle group?"
112,RES,patient,It seems like it's all over.
112,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. And um, I'll ask you about a couple other symptoms just to rule out um, any other issues that you might be having. So have you noticed that you've been confused at all over the past few days?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."
112,RES,doctor,Have you had any like stiffness or rigidity in your neck?
112,RES,patient,"Maybe a little bit of a stiffness in, in my neck."
112,RES,doctor,Okay.
112,RES,patient,"Then like I, I don't know if that's just the muscle pain. It's like kind of on my upper back, lower neck area."
112,RES,doctor,"We can definitely um, examine that, um, when I'm doing physical examine and see how that is. Um, okay, and uh, have you had any, um, redness in your eyes, or any teary eyes?"
112,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
112,RES,doctor,"Do the headaches come and go, or is it always there?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh, they're pretty much like constant throughout the day."
112,RES,doctor,"Um, and do you have a runny nose or stuffy nose?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh no, no I don't I, I think I'm kind of, I'm developing a little cough though."
112,RES,doctor,"Okay, when did that start?"
112,RES,patient,Probably just yesterday I noticed myself coughing.
112,RES,doctor,Is it like a dry cough or wet cough?

112,RES,patient,"Yeah, well I try to wear the mask. Sometimes like uh, in the, in the stock, like lounge, we like take take off the mask to eat and stuff but that's about it."
112,RES,doctor,Are you maintaining social distancing when you're taking your mask off?
112,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's uh, most of the times we're pretty socially distanced when we're eating, but sometimes it's like hard to control when you know, when you're going near the microwave to heat up your food, and sometimes it gets hard. It's a, it's a fairly small room, so."
112,RES,doctor,"Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
112,RES,patient,"No, we've been uh, at home."

112,RES,doctor,"Good. Um, okay, have you had any um, have you had migraines in the past?"
112,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, sometimes I, when I'm like stressed at work and like I uh, it's not like anything regular that happens to me. I probably have had migraines in the past."
112,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay, and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or um, with uh, COPD?"
112,RES,patient,No.
112,RES,doctor,"Okay, alright, um so it sounds like you've had a headache for the past week, which has been kind of constant, about 7 out of 10. And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday. What about um, sense of taste? Have you noticed any changes there?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh, no, not that I've really noticed."
112,RES,doctor,What about your sense of smell?
112,RES,patient,"Um, my smell, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel a bit, like stuffy as well. Like not, not right now, but before when I felt stuffy I lost my sense of smell."
112,RES,doctor,"Sure, yeah, okay. Um, okay well that's all the questions I have for you. We'll do a physical exam um, get a chest x-ray done, also examine your neck as well a little bit, just to make sure there's no stiffness or rigidity, have a look inside your mouth, um, listen to your chest."
112,RES,patient,Okay.
112,RES,doctor,"We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?"
112,RES,patient,"Uh no that, that all sounds great. Thanks for explaining it to me."
112,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
112,RES,patient,Okay.
113,RES,doctor,"So what uh, brings you here today?"
113,RES,patient,"I am here with uh, with my daughter, who has just been having a cough for the past um, two weeks."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and can you describe the cough a little bit? Is it a dry cough or is she bringing anything up?"
113,RES,patient,"Um, it is a, it is a dry cough, um, but she just keeps coughing and coughing and, and then she just, you know, once she'll start coughing she just doesn't stop. And then um, there's been times when she just turns blue, she's coughing so much. Um, and then it just gets, gets better um, on its own. But yeah, it's a dry cough."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?"
113,RES,patient,"Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, is it kind of a wheeze?"
113,RES,patient,"Yeah, sure."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and so there's episodes where she also turns blue?"
113,RES,patient,"When she's coughing a lot, yeah, she does."
113,RES,doctor,Okay.
113,RES,patient,She's also vomited once or twice.
113,RES,doctor,"Oh, I see, okay. Um, any blood in the vomit? Or is she coughing up any blood?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"No, okay. Um, any, so this started two weeks ago, any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um, cold-like symptoms before then?"
113,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose. It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?"
113,RES,patient,"No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. And the cough is pretty constant, or is it, does it come and go?"
113,RES,patient,"Yeah, she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs, and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue, or just um, get better in a couple, couple minutes. This kind of comes and goes like that."
113,RES,doctor,Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?
113,RES,patient,"I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age. So I just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and so, has this happened before at all?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?"
113,RES,patient,It's usually just what she's eaten.
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?"
113,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really."
113,RES,doctor,"Um, and how about her behaviour? Does she seem like uh, very tired or fatigued, or more irritable?"
113,RES,patient,"She does get tired, especially after, and then she's irritable and crying after, you know, she has these fits of coughs."
113,RES,doctor,Okay.
113,RES,patient,Yeah.
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Any um, any trouble with urinating at all?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,No. How's her sleeping like?
113,RES,patient,"Uh, not great. It's just the cough keeps uh, waking her up and she just doesn't, can't fall asleep."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay, any uh, exposure to dust or fumes, or animals or pets at home?"
113,RES,patient,"We, we did get a cat um, about a month ago."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and any, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"Um, and any allergies that you know of?"
113,RES,patient,"Um, no."
113,RES,doctor,"And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?"
113,RES,patient,"No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well."
113,RES,doctor,And was she at term or premature?
113,RES,patient,"She was at term, she was born at term."
113,RES,doctor,"Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?"
113,RES,patient,"Uh, vaginal."
113,RES,doctor,"And did she have to stay in the NICU at all, at the hospital afterwards?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. And is she feeding well, like what does she usually eat?"
113,RES,patient,"She's feeding well. She's doing uh, she eats everything, yeah."
113,RES,doctor,"Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
113,RES,patient,No.
113,RES,doctor,"Um, and does anyone smoke in the house?"
113,RES,patient,"Um, her dad, but he, he doesn't smoke in front of her."
113,RES,doctor,"And what's her living situation like? Who does she live with? And do you live in a house, apartment?"
113,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, we live in an apartment. It's uh, me, my partner, her and the cat."
113,RES,doctor,Okay. And any difficulties or complications with her growth? Like in terms of her weight or her height?
113,RES,patient,"No, no complications. She's doing okay."
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?"
113,RES,patient,Yes.
113,RES,doctor,"Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
113,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
113,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?"
113,RES,patient,"Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that."
113,RES,doctor,And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?
113,RES,patient,"Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those."
113,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child."
113,RES,patient,"Okay, I'll think about it."
113,RES,doctor,"Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?"
113,RES,patient,Sure.
113,RES,doctor,"Alright, take care."
114,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
114,RES,patient,"Hi, um, I'm here because I, I had this cough for a couple days and now my voice still hasn't recovered. It sounds really hoarse and I can't speak as well, so I was just wondering if you can give me something for that."
114,RES,doctor,"Possibly we will see just gotta ask a few questions first, and we'll, we'll do a physical exam as well afterwards, but certainly, we'll look into what is causing your symptoms. So you mentioned a cough. When did that exactly start?"
114,RES,patient,That started three days ago.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and have you had a cough before?"
114,RES,patient,"Um, like before the three days you mean?"
114,RES,doctor,Yeah.
114,RES,patient,"Um, no, I was pretty healthy before then."
114,RES,doctor,"I see and uh, with the cough, are you producing any phlegm or sputum?"
114,RES,patient,"No, it's pretty dry."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, have you noticed any blood?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you had a wheeze?"
114,RES,patient,"No, uh, no, nothing like that."
114,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you had any uh, chest pain with the cough?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Alright uh, and you noticed that your voice is, voice changed, and that was about 3 days ago as well?"
114,RES,patient,"Yeah, that, so, well no, actually that started about yesterday. Yeah, yesterday in the afternoon."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and uh, any triggers for this? Like were you at any events that you had to be uh, kind of speaking loudly or talking a lot or anything where you're straining your voice?"
114,RES,patient,"Um no, no, I wasn't. I was like, I had school, I came home, I didn't do anything like that."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay. Yeah, so it sounds, yeah, just sort of came on on its own. Alright, and have you had any like, eye redness, or discharge, or a runny nose?"
114,RES,patient,"I have had uh, I've had a runny nose before, but no eye discharge."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay. With the runny nose, what, what, what could you describe the uh, mucus that was coming out?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh, it was, it was clear."
114,RES,doctor,And has that gone away now and then when was the runny nose?
114,RES,patient,"Yeah, that's gone, yeah that's gone. That went away but like, um, yeah, two days ago maybe."
114,RES,doctor,"I see, and have you had a sore throat or do you have a sore throat?"
114,RES,patient,"Um I have, so, it hurts because I'm coughing, but it doesn't seem like it's my actual throat."
114,RES,doctor,"Alright, is there any pain with swallowing food or liquids?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and have you had any fevers or chills?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Or any, any night sweats?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,And any changes to your weight recently?
114,RES,patient,"Um, I've had some weight gain over the past like six months."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, well that's great. And about how much?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh just, maybe like 5, 10 pounds. 5 to 10 pounds, somewhere around there."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, well that's good. And um, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,How about any abdominal pain?
114,RES,patient,Uh no.
114,RES,doctor,"Any uh, diarrhea?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,Or any urinary problems?
114,RES,patient,No.

114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and any skin changes or rashes?"
114,RES,patient,"Nope, nothing like that."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, uh, and um, so you've been experiencing, so you had a runny nose that's gone away um, and now you've been having this cough for the past, dry cough, past three days and lost your voice yesterday. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
114,RES,patient,"Um no, no other symptoms."
114,RES,doctor,"Alright, in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh no, I've been pretty healthy."
114,RES,doctor,"That's great, and u, have you been, um, have you had any allergies before?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and uh, do you take any medications regularly?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh, I just take some multivitamins."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and uh are you aware if your immunizations are up to date?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh, so I have everything except for that HPV vaccine."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, is it, do you have a plan to get that one or?"
114,RES,patient,"I think so. I'm just uh, waiting to follow up with my family doctor about that."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, well that, that's a good idea for sure. So it's great that you have a plan for that, um, for that. Yeah, it can be really helpful for preventing cervical cancer, as, as I'm sure you'll talk to the, with the family doctor about. Yeah, and have you had any hospitalizations or any surgeries?"
114,RES,patient,Uh no.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, where about are you living right now, and who are living with?"
114,RES,patient,"I live uh, with my parents um, and my two younger siblings. We live in a house."
114,RES,doctor,Has anybody else been sick or have similar symptoms?
114,RES,patient,"Uh no, no one at home's been sick."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and uh, how about anybody at school or, or work, or anything like that that you've been around who's been sick?"
114,RES,patient,"So one of my friends actually had like a runny nose and a cough as well a couple of days ago, but uh, she seems to be better now and her voice is okay."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere outside of the city or province?"
114,RES,patient,"No, no, not recently."
114,RES,doctor,"Alright, and, um, in the home, is there any uh like, are you exposed to any violence of any sort, like physical or emotional, either yourself or, or witnessing?"
114,RES,patient,No.
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, and what grade are you in?"
114,RES,patient,"I'm in grade 7 or, yeah grade 7 now."
114,RES,doctor,"Oh awesome, and uh, I don't, is there any smoking in the home?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh no, no one smokes at home."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay um, and then, um, anybody in the family uh, have any heart or lung conditions?"
114,RES,patient,"Heart or lung? I know, um, like, heart disease, runs on my father's side of the family. I'm not really sure like exactly what, what kind of diseases though."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and I, sometimes people that, kind of in this age group, might experience with either drugs or alcohol. Have any of your friends done that or, or yourself?"
114,RES,patient,"I know like some of my friends have uh, tried alcohol and try marijuana, but I haven't experimented yet."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, that's good and um, I, that's all I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to add?"
114,RES,patient,"Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?"
114,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?"
114,RES,patient,"Uh no, I haven't."
114,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness."
114,RES,patient,Okay.
114,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there."
114,RES,patient,"Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."
115,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
115,RES,patient,"Hi, I've I've just been. I've been sneezing a lot and I have this runny nose. It's just been very irritating. I kind of want to do something about it. I've had it for awhile, but it's just. You know, I decided to like, come in to find out what's. What's wrong with me? Why do I like? Why does this happen to me? All my friends are OK."
115,RES,doctor,"Oh yeah, I know it must be very, very irritating. How long has it been going on for?"
115,RES,patient,"It's been years, I don't even remember."
115,RES,doctor,"Oh years, OK and years like just sneezing and the runny nose has been going on for the last few years."
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, it kind of kind of comes on like around the spring time. It just gets really bad at that time."
115,RES,doctor,"yeah? OK, and are there any besides during the spring time, any kind of allergens or any anything in the house or around you that triggers it, like dust or anything like that?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, dust makes it a lot worse. Like when I have to vacuum the house, I just feel awful for the next two days."
115,RES,doctor,"I see, do you get any other symptoms besides the, uh, sneezing and runny nose?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, let my nose so stuffy and sometimes it's just like my eyes and my nose are just itchy and my eyes get like red and teary sometimes. It's so embarrassing when I'm going to school. I also wake up in the morning with this like sore throat and have just cough and clear out my, you know clear my throat."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, and does that happen like every morning?"
115,RES,patient,It's usually worse around springtime.
115,RES,doctor,OK. and are you coughing at all?
115,RES,patient,"Well, I have to like cough to clear my throat but then not otherwise."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you bringing up any sputum?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, that yeah I do."
115,RES,doctor,"Like, uh, how much would you say? Do you just bring it up in the morning, or like throughout the day,"
115,RES,patient,"just in the morning,"
115,RES,doctor,just in the morning?
115,RES,patient,Yeah
115,RES,doctor,Do you have a sensation of like anything kind of dripping down your throat like after you wake up like just a build up?
115,RES,patient,Yeah yeah I do.
115,RES,doctor,"Ok. And besides that, have you been having any symptoms of fevers, chills, sore throat?"
115,RES,patient,"I get a bit of a sore throat, I guess in the morning, but it just goes away after."
115,RES,doctor,"OK,"
115,RES,patient,But no fevers.
115,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that you've tried at all, like medications or anything that has helped you with these symptoms?"
115,RES,patient,"Uhm yeah, I tried like umm Reactin and that really helped."
115,RES,doctor,That helped OK that's good and are you taking Reactin right now?
115,RES,patient,I didn't take it today. I tried it a couple days ago.
115,RES,doctor,OK. And have you traveled at all recently?
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,"No, OK, and any sick contacts, anyone around you that has been sick?"

115,RES,patient,no.
115,RES,doctor,Any fevers or chills?
115,RES,patient,no.
115,RES,doctor,Any kind of fatigue or tiredness throughout the day?
115,RES,patient,I do feel more fatigued when I have these symptoms.
115,RES,doctor,"OK, any night sweats, fevers, or chills?"
115,RES,patient,no.
115,RES,doctor,Any changes in your bowel movements at all?
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,Any trouble urinating?
115,RES,patient,no.
115,RES,doctor,Any changes to your appetite or weight?
115,RES,patient,"I've been losing weight, but I've been dieting and working out more."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, and how much weight would you say you've lost over the last few months?"
115,RES,patient,"I've lost about four pounds in the past four, five months. It's been hard to lose weight."
115,RES,doctor,"And so no, no sudden like loss of weight or anything like that right now?"
115,RES,patient,"No, no, no"
115,RES,doctor,"Well, it's really great that you're, you know, trying to lose weight and dieting and and having like a healthier lifestyle. It is definitely harder with the pandemic going on right now to to get in the activities. And it's hard like being at home, and sometimes it's really difficult to like not eat right"
115,RES,patient,Yeah yeah true.
115,RES,doctor,"So besides besides that any kind of recent exposures to any fumes, dust, animals, pets like anything like that?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, it was kind of like vacuuming a couple of days ago when it got really bad, but nothing. Not not. I don't think there's not been any other exposures."
115,RES,doctor,"OK. And do you have any past medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with like asthma, eczema, anything like that?"
115,RES,patient,"I haven't been diagnosed with anything. No. I did have like I know that I would sometimes get kind of short of breath as a child. But my mom doesn't really trust doctors, so she wouldn't take me to one."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?"
115,RES,patient,"I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me."
115,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, do you have that at all now?"
115,RES,patient,"No, no, I don't."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, OK Have you ever seen an allergist before?"
115,RES,patient,"No, no."
115,RES,doctor,No OK. Do you have any known allergies to any medications? Yeah any medication?
115,RES,patient,no
115,RES,doctor,no. Do you take any medications at all on a regular basis?
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?"
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,"Any family history of any asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis. Anything like that?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think it kind of runs in my family like everyone in my family is just kind of always having this runny nose and sneezing. My mom has it. My younger brother has it. But like we haven't really been diagnosed with anything like we, we rarely go to the doctor."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and currently right now, do you work at all? Or sorry, do you go to school?"
115,RES,patient,I do I do. I've been doing it virtually.
115,RES,doctor,"Virtually OK, so have you noticed anyone sick around you?"
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,No OK. And what at home? What's your living situation like? Who do you live with?
115,RES,patient,"I live with my mom, dad and my younger brother."
115,RES,doctor,"And, yeah, I just want to let you know that any questions I ask you today and anything we talked about it's completely confidential and unless like there is any potential harm to yourself or anyone anyone else. So yeah, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Do you feel safe at home?"
115,RES,patient,Oh yeah.
115,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you drink alcohol at all? Or have you tried alcohol?"
115,RES,patient,"No, not at all."
115,RES,doctor,Have you tried any recreational drugs like marijuana?
115,RES,patient,No. No.
115,RES,doctor,How about smoking?
115,RES,patient,Umm no
115,RES,doctor,"no OK, and are you sexually active?"
115,RES,patient,No.
115,RES,doctor,"No OK. And so overall, do you feel safe in your home and as well as outside of your home environment? Any kind of bullying or anything like that going on?"
115,RES,patient,"No, not at all."
115,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. Yeah, so those are kind of all the questions that I had for you. Sorry just one more question, any loss of sense of taste or smell?"
115,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's hard to smell and my nose is stuffy, but no loss of taste."
115,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. OK, so do you have any questions at all for me?"
115,RES,patient,"No, I just I I just wanna get some medications to help with this. I'm just sick and tired of my runny nose."
115,RES,doctor,"Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?"
115,RES,patient,yeah
115,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist"
115,RES,patient,sure.
115,RES,doctor,"And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction."
115,RES,patient,Sure
115,RES,doctor,"Alright. Thank you, take care."
116,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
116,RES,patient,"Hi Faiha, I've been very concerned lately. This past week I, first just started having this really bad headache and then my body, just completely all started hurting after completely rest, and then three days ago I just started having a lot of chills and I had a pretty high fever, just two days ago of almost like I think it was like 38 or 39, yeah, I was just very concerned and I came here today."

116,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Does anything make it better or worse?"
116,RES,patient,"Just some rest and, uh, I tried to take some Tylenol to get rid of it, took some Advil as well. It did help a little bit, but it just kind of came back after the medication wore out."

116,RES,patient,"Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?"
116,RES,doctor,"Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related."
116,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?"
116,RES,doctor,"Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah."
116,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good.Thank you."
116,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no worries, take care."
116,RES,patient,Thank you.
117,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
117,RES,patient,"Yeah, um, so I have been, I have this cough, I'm coughing up blood so that's made me a little bit worried, um, so I thought I should come and get, get it investigated."
117,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah no definitely, that, that's definitely concerning, is, so when did this start?"
117,RES,patient,"It, the coughing up blood started about a week and a half ago."

117,RES,patient,"Uhm, but it's not getting any better, and it's not stopping."
117,RES,doctor,"OK and did it start, did the cough just start, uh with, uh, blood in the cough or what, did it just start as a normal cough first?"
117,RES,patient,It started off as a normal cough first.
117,RES,doctor,"OK, and did you have any kind of production of sputum with yellow or greenish material at all?"

117,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it like a constant cough? Or does it come and go?"

117,RES,patient,"No, never."

117,RES,patient,"I have been feeling chills and uhm, I haven't actually taken my temperature, but I feel hot, so it's possible that I have a fever."

117,RES,doctor,"No, OK, alright, so those are all the questions we had. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
117,RES,patient,"No, what do you think I have and is there anything I need to do right now?"
117,RES,doctor,"Yeah, So what, uh, some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing up blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if"
117,RES,patient,OK
117,RES,doctor,"So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that OK with you? Any questions or concerns?"
117,RES,patient,"Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?"
117,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible."
117,RES,patient,"OK, great, thank you."
117,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
118,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?

118,MSK,patient,"Um, not that I've been told, no."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um, so um, next I just wanted to move on to the physical exam component and um, firstly, are you having any issues with uh walking?"
118,MSK,patient,"No, I've been like, uh, no, no pain, no. I can walk just fine, no issues there."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, excellent. So no antalgic gait. And when looking at um, the area, are you seeing any swelling or, or redness, or skin discolouration?"
118,MSK,patient,"No, no, nothing like that. It's just, uh, I can tell there's like a lump there, and if I press it, I can feel like the hard lump, but um, no changes in the skin above it."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and are you seeing any um, muscle atrophy around the area?"
118,MSK,patient,"No um, nothing like that."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and are you seeing any, uh, like joint deformities or, or anything like that?"
118,MSK,patient,"Um, no, not that I can tell."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um and, uh you don't have any, any pain, so if you press on the area or on the the knee joint, you can just feel the mass and no pain there?"
118,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it just feels weird. I don't, I'm not in any pain or anything, but it's like, it's weird to look at and then weird to feel uh, as well."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay. Um, and um, uh okay, then no limitations with uh, with like range of motion of any of your joints including like uh, knee and ankle?"
118,MSK,patient,"Yeah no, I can move everything just fine."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, awesome and so that, that was everything that I wanted to ask today and uh, uh check on the physical as well. Um, so was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about or anything you wanted to add?"
118,MSK,patient,"Yeah no, I um, nothing else I wanted to add, but I, I think my parents and I were just scared about it being like uh, cancer, or like a tumour, um, so I just don't know what I should do, if I need to get any tests done, or x-rays, or anything like that."
118,MSK,doctor,"Okay, um, yeah, we, so um, the first thing we will want to get uh, an x-ray um, of the knee and also of the uh, long bones, so of your femur um, as well as your leg too. Uh, and because right now we, um, most likely think is called something, um, an osteochondroma, um, which is the most common uh, primary benign bone tumour. Um, however, there are other things that it, it could be, um, and so, such as like an osteoma, or um, an endochondroma, um, so we'll, we'll want to um, get that x-ray and um, kind of go, go from there."
118,MSK,patient,"Okay, uh, yeah that, that sounds good."
118,MSK,doctor,"Alright, so we'll get that, we'll get that ordered."
118,MSK,patient,"Alright perfect, thank you so much."
119,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've had this chest tightness and and been short of breath and bringing up sputum with this uh cough."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, so um lets start with the cough. When did that start?"
119,RES,patient,"So I've had a cough now for a few years, um but over this past uh three days it's gotten quite a bit worse."
119,RES,patient,Yeah.
119,RES,doctor,Um are there any triggers for your cough?
119,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, if I'm doing, um, like if I'm really active like if I run to catch the bus or uh or if I'm shovelling snow, maybe I can make, become short of breath, but um not if I'm just walking around the block or anything like that."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, and what caused this cough initially three years ago? Do you know?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, I think um I think it's just a smokers cough. I think that my family doctor told me I had like chronic bronchitis before."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. How often were you coughing before it got worse recently?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh I would usually cough every day, but the cough would be, usually just in the morning, I I'd get up um, there, I would cough up some sputum and and then maybe, and then I'd usually be OK."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, um and does anything make your cough better? Like do you take any over the counter cough syrup?"
119,RES,patient,"Um yeah, I've tried some over the counter uh cough syrups in the past, but it hasn't helped."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and if you were to talk about the quality of your cough, is it is it barky? Does it sound harsh? What does it sound like?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, I would say it sounds pretty harsh. You can kind of, it sounds like there's um mucus moving around, I guess with with the cough in my chest, I can I can kind of feel it"
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and you mentioned that you're producing a lot of sputum with your cough. What colour is that sputum?"
119,RES,patient,Greenish
119,RES,doctor,"Green, OK. Any blood?"
119,RES,patient,No blood.
119,RES,doctor,"No blood, OK. And you mentioned, you've never produced sputum with the cough, especially not green sputum in the past three years, right?"
119,RES,patient,"I would bring up sputum, but it's usually clear and white."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and do you have any wheeziness associated with this cough?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh, yes I do"
119,RES,doctor,"Yes, OK. And you mentioned you were short of breath. Were you short of breath prior to your cough or did that start um when when this cough got worse?"
119,RES,patient,I think the shortness of breath has gotten a bit worse over the um last few days uh as the cough has gotten worse.
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And if you were to rate the severity of your symptoms, of how you're feeling, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, where would you put yourself at?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh I would say an 8, it's been really tough, it's been getting really difficult to um breathe."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. And have you ever experienced anything to this severity in the past?"
119,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had uh this difficulty breathing before."
119,RES,doctor,OK. OK. Um do you have any chest pain?
119,RES,patient,"Uh, my chest is, it feels tight."
119,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh it feels tight, OK, does that, does it hurt though?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh no, no, it doesn't really hurt. It's just uncomfortable."
119,RES,doctor,OK. And do you think it's tight because of the coughing or um the shortness of breath?
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, I kind of feel it um with the coughing."
119,RES,doctor,OK and have you noticed any swelling in your limbs?
119,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, maybe a little bit in my in my feet, more than usual."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you feel like your heart's racing?"

119,RES,patient,"No, I've felt OK."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss?"
119,RES,patient,"Um yeah, maybe I mean over the last few years I've um lost a few pounds, but maybe maybe 10 pounds over the last last couple of years"
119,RES,doctor,"Last couple of years, OK. Was it intentional weight loss or unintentional?"
119,RES,patient,Unintentional.
119,RES,doctor,"OK, um alright, and any changes to your hair, nails or skin, like rashes?"
119,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, and how are your bowel movements? Everything normal there?"

119,RES,doctor,"No, OK um and are you otherwise healthy?"
119,RES,patient,"Um, well, I use uh these inhalers um and I think I've been told I have COPD before."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, Um other than your COPD, do you have any other longstanding medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?"
119,RES,patient,Um yeah I have uh high blood pressure and um I had my gallbladder taken out uh a few years ago.
119,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, any other surgeries or hospitalizations?"
119,RES,patient,Uh I had an ACL repair like when I was a teenager.
119,RES,doctor,"OK, and besides the inhalers, are you on any other medication?"
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, there's one for blood pressure um and I take vitamin D, um and that's it."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, which one, which um medication are you on for the blood pressure?"
119,RES,patient,Uh amlodipine.
119,RES,doctor,"Amlodipine, OK. When did you start taking that?"
119,RES,patient,About uh seven years ago.
119,RES,doctor,"OK, and then for your uh COPD, which inhalers are you on?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh, there's one that's for, um, like short acting. And then there's one that I use everyday, uh Spiriva, I think."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. And how long have you been on these inhalers?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh it's been a couple of years for well, for the the short one that I I use for rescue therapies been for like a long time, but Spiriva's been the last several years."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and do you find that your inhalers are helping?"
119,RES,patient,"Yeah. They um, I definitely notice a difference when I, if I miss a dose or something."
119,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. And um, do you have any allergies?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."
119,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about um immunizations, are you up to date?"
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, I believe so."
119,RES,doctor,"OK. And in terms of family history, uh are there any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?"
119,RES,patient,"Um, uh no."
119,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Um do you currently smoke?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh I do, yes. I've been trying to quit, I um I smoke about a pack of cigarettes per day now. I used to smoke like 2 packs per day."
119,RES,doctor,"OK, well it's it's good that you've cut down, um if you need any additional help cutting down we have resources that we can refer you to."
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, that would be great."
119,RES,doctor,"Yeah, um how much, for how long have you been smoking? Like how many years?"

119,RES,doctor,OK. Um and do you do any marijuana?
119,RES,patient,Uh no.
119,RES,doctor,"No, OK, OK, um how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"
119,RES,patient,"Yeah, a few beers on the weekend."
119,RES,doctor,OK. Um and then where do you live currently?
119,RES,patient,I live in an apartment by myself.
119,RES,doctor,"OK. Um and any reasons to think that there are any old carpets, mold, or um asbestos or anything like that that could be exacerbating your symptoms?"
119,RES,patient,"Uh I mean I do have a carpet in the bedroom so, but I mean that that's the only carpet in the apartment."
119,RES,doctor,OK. Um and do you live with anyone?
119,RES,patient,"No, it's it's just me and my dog."
119,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh have you, have you been around any sick contacts recently?"
119,RES,patient,"Um maybe, I mean I I usually will see uh, a couple of friends, we'll meet up to grab some coffee"
119,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, how about um travel, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
119,RES,patient,No.
119,RES,doctor,"No, OK. OK, well I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss?"
119,RES,patient,"Um no, I just wanted to, um, yeah, come in because it's been really difficult to breathe."
119,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so OK, well we'll do a physical exam on you um to try to understand um how bad your COPD exacerbation is. Um we'll also try to get an um oxygen saturation on you, and we do want that reading"
119,RES,patient,That sounds great. Thank you.
119,RES,doctor,Alright. Take care.
120,RES,patient,"I was just bringing my son and he's just had cough for the last couple of days. I thought about a day and a half ago, it doesn't feel like a cold. He hasn't been too sick, but I was a little bit worried and I wanted to get him seen to see if there's anything we could do."
120,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. It's a good thing that you brought him in. So the cough, is it consistent? Or does it come and go?"
120,RES,patient,"It seems to be a little bit worse at night. He'll have this cough during the day. Sometimes I'll notice when he's playing. He's had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from. He hasn't been too active to be honest. He's been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days, but in regards to consistency, I'd say it's a little bit worse at night."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, any other triggers like dust or the cold air? Anything like that?"
120,RES,patient,"I haven't really noticed anything. We've been mainly keeping inside due to covid, right? I think my wife left a window open the other night, and maybe the cough was a little bit better. I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to tell when we sleep."
120,RES,doctor,"Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?"
120,RES,patient,"No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, good. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's barky? Is it harsh?"
120,RES,patient,"Barky might be a good word to describe it, like he's had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds harsh. It sounds like he's really trying to cough hard there. Very violent sometimes."
120,RES,doctor,OK OK. And has he ever had a cough like this in the past?
120,RES,patient,"No, never."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and then in terms of the timeline, is it getting worse? His cough?"
120,RES,patient,"I think it has been to be honest. He was a little ill like he had a runny nose a couple of days ago, maybe two days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the first day, about two days ago so. Now it's been more present I suppose,than it was when he just first had it."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it a dry cough or does he bring up sputum?"
120,RES,patient,"Sputum like phlegm,no he doesn't bring anything up really, so dry."
120,RES,doctor,OK so no blood as well right?
120,RES,patient,No blood.
120,RES,doctor,"OK,  does he have any shortness of breath with his cough?"
120,RES,patient,"I feel like when he has the coughing fits, he's winded. He's weak after them. Sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it, but just resting normally, he doesn't seem that out of breath, no."
120,RES,doctor,OK any wheeziness?
120,RES,patient,"No, not really. He's able to breathe. I can't really hear him breathing that much. Sometimes at night after a bad cough he'll be really winded. And yeah, it does sound like a little different when he's breathing, but just right now he sounds normal."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and any reason for you to think he has chest pain?"
120,RES,patient,"He hasn't any sort of chest pain. He says his throat hurts, but I don't think it's his chest."
120,RES,doctor,Has he had any fevers?
120,RES,doctor,"Any change in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
120,RES,patient,"No, no rashes."
120,RES,doctor,How about weight loss?
120,RES,patient,"No weight loss, he's a fairly healthy kid."
120,RES,doctor,And his vision and hearing are normal?
120,RES,patient,"You know, I haven't gotten him formally assessed yet, but seems to be able to read pretty well from a distance. He's not in school yet, but I haven't noticed anything, and he can hear fine. I think he responds when I call."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, has he had a stuffy or runny nose?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah yeah, that's kind of how it first started three days ago. Maybe had a runny nose. OK, yeah."
120,RES,doctor,Does he still have a runny nose?
120,RES,patient,"Umm, a little bit less now. No, not as much now."
120,RES,doctor,"OK. And his taste, any reason to believe there are any changes there?"
120,RES,patient,"Well, we've been kind of spoiling him a bit, just giving him ice cream. His throat hurts a little bit and he seems to still like it, so it's hard to tell."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well?"
120,RES,patient,Yeah.
120,RES,doctor,"OK OK, and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you've noticed?"
120,RES,patient,"No fainting or dizzy spells, but he's really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he doesn't want to stand up, he'll just be sitting down or he wants to be held."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, is he more irritable than usual?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah after he has a bad coughing fit, he wants to be soothed and he'll be crying, but it's just more of because he's worn out, I believe he's tired."
120,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, and then any confusion or memory loss?"
120,RES,patient,No.
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and then in terms of his bowel movements, have things been normal from that standpoint?"
120,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, process of potty training him, but no, no real changes."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, so no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"
120,RES,patient,No.
120,RES,doctor,OK and he's passing gas?
120,RES,patient,OK yeah I'd say so.
120,RES,doctor,Any nausea or vomiting?
120,RES,patient,"No. We haven't been really feeding him solid meals, it's because he's been sick, we've been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts, but he's able to keep them down. So no, no nausea, no vomiting."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and then how about changes in his appetite?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah, he's not eating as much but still, we're trying to force food into him to keep his energy up. Most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon, but now not so much."
120,RES,doctor,OK. Alright and any anything else that I missed that he's been experiencing over the past few days?
120,RES,patient,"No, just the cough."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and then he otherwise healthy? Does he have any longstanding medical conditions?"
120,RES,patient,"No longstanding medical conditions. Yeah, nothing really. We had a little bit of stay in the NICU, just because he was a little bit underweight, but no, nothing really."
120,RES,doctor,OK. And then his mother's pregnancy with him? Any complications at that point?
120,RES,patient,Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think.
120,RES,doctor,"OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit."
120,RES,patient,Yeah.
120,RES,doctor,"OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected. We thought it was just a regular contraction and that it will just resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the hospital"
120,RES,doctor,"OK and then in terms of growth, weight and head circumference, has he been hitting all those milestones for the past 2 1/2 years?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah, we we bring him to the family doctor every couple of month for his regular checkups and nothing has been brought up to be concerning for his vaccines. He has been doing well."
120,RES,doctor,"OK and then how about other milestones like speech, movement, fine movement, all of that, like have those been normal? Is he on par with his peers?"
120,RES,patient,"Yeah, this is our first kid, but compared to his cousins he seems to be doing well. He's speaking, he's got little sentences, now he has good eye contact. He's a good kid."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, good good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries aside from when he was born?"
120,RES,patient,No no.
120,RES,doctor,OK good and is he on any medications?
120,RES,patient,"No, OK we give him like a flintstone gummy."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
120,RES,patient,Yeah.
120,RES,doctor,Any allergies?
120,RES,patient,Not that we know of.
120,RES,doctor,Any family history of lung conditions?
120,RES,patient,"So my grandfather, so his greatgrandfather I suppose passed away from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker though. On my mom's side there's some breast cancer. No,  nothing really that comes to mind for lungs."
120,RES,doctor,And any heart conditions?
120,RES,patient,"No, not that we know of."
120,RES,doctor,And how about other cancers?
120,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, how about asthma, eczema or allergies in the family?"
120,RES,patient,"You know, I think my sister is allergic to peas, but she was never sick from them like go to the hospital.  I don't think there are any allergies in the family."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
120,RES,patient,"You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin. And we kind of thought that that's where he got the cold from. Like the runny nose, but it just turned weird, you know."
120,RES,doctor,OK and how's this cousin doing?
120,RES,patient,"Last time I talked to Charlotte, Hank seems to be doing well so."
120,RES,doctor,"Alright, and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Have you any of you traveled anywhere recently?"
120,RES,patient,"No, with covid and everything, we have just been keeping to ourselves."
120,RES,doctor,And with who and where does he live?
120,RES,patient,He lives with me and his mother in a house
120,RES,doctor,OK. Any old carpets or mold or concerns for asbestos? Anything like that at home?
120,RES,patient,I don't know when this house is built. I don't think there's any asbestos in it and it's all hardwood. So no.
120,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Anyone at home smoke?"
120,RES,patient,"No, no."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me?"
120,RES,patient,"No, no that's it, no."
120,RES,doctor,"OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any"
120,RES,patient,"A little scary. Sounds good. OK, I'll just keep an eye on him for the next five days."
120,RES,doctor,Give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they're not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him. Of course we will do a physical exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are. Most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely won't need any additional treatments.
120,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
120,RES,doctor,Alright take care.
120,RES,patient,Thank you.
121,RES,doctor,Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?
121,RES,patient,"Sure, my 5 year old daughter, I noticed that she's been coughing a lot over the past two days. She sounds like she has a stuffy nose and now she's got this pink eye so I just wanted to get it checked out by you."
121,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So the cough started 5 days ago?"
121,RES,patient,Two days ago.
121,RES,doctor,OK and is the cough barky or harsh sounding?
121,RES,patient,"Yes, it sounds harsh."
121,RES,doctor,"OK, alright was there anything that changed two days ago that might have triggered the cough?"
121,RES,patient,"I don't think so, although she does go to daycare."
121,RES,doctor,"OK, uh and so has she been bringing up any sputum with the cough?"
121,RES,patient,"No, no sputum that I've noticed."
121,RES,doctor,"OK, notice any blood?"
121,RES,patient,No.
121,RES,doctor,"Alright, and is the cough worse at any particular time of day?"
121,RES,patient,No.
121,RES,doctor,"OK, and has there been any wheezing?"
121,RES,patient,"No, not that I noticed."
121,RES,doctor,OK. And you mentioned the red eyes. When did you notice that?

121,RES,doctor,"Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing."

123,MSK,doctor,"Okay. And currently, right now, um, what is your living situation like?"
123,MSK,patient,"Uh, so um, I just live with uh, two of my, um, or actually sorry no, I live with my uh, with my parents and uh, yeah, so it's just both my parents."
123,MSK,doctor,"Okay. And, um, do you currently work?"
123,MSK,patient,"Uh, I was working until like, I um, yeah about uh, about 15 years ago and now I, like I got injured on the, uh, um at work and I've had like chronic back pain and I don't know, I think that's kind of how this partly all, all started. So I've been at home receiving uh, I'm on disability."
123,MSK,doctor,Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes?
123,MSK,patient,"Uh, I do, yeah I, I, I smoke um, about half a pack uh, to a pack a day."

123,MSK,doctor,"Okay, and yeah, we were just talking about some of uh, like the movement, but you're saying you have pain with any kind of movement at all, right?"
123,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it, it's really painful, I just, I try not to move it at all."
123,MSK,doctor,And it's very red and swollen and warm as well?
123,MSK,patient,"Yeah, all of those."
123,MSK,doctor,Any symptoms at all in your hips or ankle?
123,MSK,patient,"No, those feel fine. I can move my hip and ankle okay, and no pain."
123,MSK,doctor,"Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. We'll do like a full physical examination, take a look at your knee, um, and most likely, what this sounds like, is something called septic arthritis. It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back. And you may also require um, an admission today as well."
123,MSK,patient,"Okay, uh, thank you. Yeah, that, that sounds good."
123,MSK,doctor,"Alright, yeah, so yeah, we'll get all that done for you shortly, and uh, we'll go from there."
123,MSK,patient,"Right, thank you."
123,MSK,doctor,"And um, we might also need an x-ray, so just sit tight. We'll, we'll come call you."
123,MSK,patient,"Okay, thank you."
123,MSK,doctor,"Alright, you're welcome."
124,RES,doctor,"Uh, what brings you in here today?"
124,RES,patient,"Uhm, so I've had this runny nose, well first it was a stuffy nose, but now I've had this runny nose for the past week and a half and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. So I was just wondering if you could give me something for that?"
124,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so yeah, let's just try to first see what's going on. So you've been having this, so when did it start getting stuffy?"
124,RES,patient,"Uhm, it started getting stuffy about two weeks ago."
124,RES,doctor,"Two weeks ago, and when did it start getting, like just a runny nose?"
124,RES,patient,"Yeah, that started a week and a half ago."

124,RES,patient,"Uhm, they are pretty constant."
124,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that you have tried that has helped you with these symptoms? Any over the counter medications?"
124,RES,patient,"No, I haven't tried anything. I've been thinking about using some nasal decongestion but I don't want to make my runny nose any worse."
124,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?"
124,RES,patient,"No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses."
124,RES,doctor,"OK, so do you, are you feeling, that pressure in your face at all?"
124,RES,patient,"Mhm, a little bit, yeah."
124,RES,doctor,OK. Have you at all in the past couple weeks to a month had contact with anyone that was sick?

124,RES,patient,No.

124,RES,patient,I live in an apartment.
124,RES,doctor,And do you live with anyone?
124,RES,patient,"No, just by myself."
124,RES,doctor,"OK, and any mold or dust or fumes, anything in your household?"

124,RES,doctor,OK. And do you drink alcohol?
124,RES,patient,Once in a while I'll have like a glass of wine every week.
124,RES,doctor,"OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?"
124,RES,patient,"Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?"
124,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?"
124,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."
124,RES,doctor,"You're welcome, take care."
124,RES,patient,You too.
124,RES,doctor,Bye.
125,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I just brought my son, went to the hospital. I've just been getting very concerned because he's making like these, like grunting noises for the last day and, like it's it's really worrying me, I don't know if he's like not breathing and I also just did like a temperature on him just this morning and it came up to like like a high 38, so I don't know what's going on, and then he's just very like irritable and just not himself I think."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, so all of this started a day ago, you mentioned?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, it started yesterday, but the grunting started today, like, I think he was a bit on the warmer side last night as well, more irritable last night, but the grunting started this morning."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, Uhm, and you mentioned his fever was 38, correct?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think it was like 38, 7 or something like that."
125,RES,doctor,OK is he coughing at all?
125,RES,patient,"Uhm, yeah, I would say with the grunting there is some coughing in between as well."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he bringing up any phlegm?"
125,RES,patient,"Uhm, he's been having some spit ups as well. They're mainly like clear and whitish, but yeah I don't know if he's bringing anything else up. There's no green or yellow material though."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, any blood in there?"
125,RES,patient,"No, I haven't notice any blood."
125,RES,doctor,Does he sound wheezy?
125,RES,patient,"Uh no, it's mainly just the grunting."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, does he look swollen to you?"
125,RES,patient,"Uh, swollen as in just, uh, like in his."
125,RES,doctor,"In his, uh, like uh, legs, arms or belly area."
125,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."
125,RES,doctor,"No ok, and uh, does he have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
125,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."
125,RES,doctor,"No, OK, how is his feeding?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's it's been difficult. So right now, like his mom is at home, but she was having difficulty feeding. He's mainly breastfed right now."
125,RES,doctor,OK.
125,RES,patient,And he's not really been feeding too much either.
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about like the number of wet diapers he has?"
125,RES,patient,"Just the normal like, that hasn't changed. He has like three or four in a day."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good. Have you noticed any changes to his bowel movements or urine?"
125,RES,patient,"No, pretty much been the same."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, is he throwing up at all?"
125,RES,patient,"Nope, just some spit ups, I don't know if that's, Just because of the coughing or if they're just spit ups, like, but nothing after eating."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, have you noticed any rashes on him?"
125,RES,patient,"No, no rashes."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, has he had any fainting spells or seizures?"
125,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I've been really trying to make sure, like, I was worried if he gets blue or something that we would rush to the emergency department, but I haven't noticed anything like that."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, OK good. Has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
125,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. We've been trying to be very careful with the pandemic and everything going on."
125,RES,doctor,"For sure, any travel to anywhere recently?"
125,RES,patient,No.
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he an other-wise healthy baby?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, so, uh, healthy but he was born premature at 36 weeks."
125,RES,doctor,OK.
125,RES,patient,"And no complications really with the pregnancy or after he was born. But yeah, he was premature."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and so he didn't need any hospitalizations right after birth, right?"
125,RES,patient,"No, he was fine after birth."
125,RES,doctor,And no longstanding medical conditions after birth?
125,RES,patient,No.
125,RES,doctor,"Has he needed hospitalizations for anything in the past, or surgeries?"
125,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, the two months vaccinations are all up to date."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Medication-wise is he on anything?"
125,RES,patient,"No, no medications."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, any allergies?"
125,RES,patient,No.
125,RES,doctor,Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?
125,RES,patient,"No, not that we know of."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, any cancers in the family?"
125,RES,patient,Nope.
125,RES,doctor,And who does he live with at home?
125,RES,patient,Just me and my wife.
125,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, in a house, apartment?"
125,RES,patient,In a house.
125,RES,doctor,"OK, any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything like that at home?"
125,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
125,RES,doctor,"OK, and does anyone at home smoke?"
125,RES,patient,Nope.
125,RES,doctor,"OK, well, those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, no, I was just really worried like, the grunting is just really scaring us. So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be."
125,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?"
125,RES,patient,"Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?"
125,RES,doctor,"Yeah so for now, because, if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen, and IV hydration, he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint. I should also mention, we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well, so we'll have to do that to rule it out."
125,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good, Uh, uh, yeah, thank you so much."
125,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no worries."
126,RES,doctor,What brings you here today?
126,RES,patient,"Hi I am having difficulties breathing and I've just had this cough and it's, It's been two months now."
126,RES,doctor,"Two months, so did the two months of the difficulty breathing or the cough?"
126,RES,patient,Two months of difficulty breathing and the cough is gotten worse. I've had a cough for a couple years now. I'm a smoker.
126,RES,doctor,OK and is is this cough different at all?
126,RES,patient,"It's just, it just doesn't go away."
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the shortness of breath start?"
126,RES,patient,About two months ago.
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it getting worse?"
126,RES,patient,oh yeah
126,RES,doctor,OK. Are you bringing up any sputum at all with your cough?

126,RES,patient,No.

126,RES,patient,Shortness of breath just kind of stays.
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath, like taking a rest or any positions in particular?"
126,RES,patient,"Yeah, sometimes resting does help. I find that it's worse when I'm moving around, I'm huffing and puffing more."
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it worse at all when you lay down?"
126,RES,patient,No.
126,RES,doctor,No? And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?
126,RES,patient,"No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep. It's been quite difficult I I don't even know why I waited so long. I should have come in earlier."
126,RES,doctor,"Well, I'm glad you came in today. We can definitely try and help you with what's going on. Do you at all use any kind of medications to help you with your symptoms?"
126,RES,patient,I've just been using my inhalers a bit more but they don't always help.

126,RES,doctor,"Have you been sick at all recently with fever? Chills, like runny nose? Any cold like symptoms?"
126,RES,patient,No.
126,RES,doctor,"No, nothing like that? Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?"

126,RES,patient,"Oh my God. So tired I can, you know, with the difficulty breathing I feel like all my energy spent just trying to, trying to get to the bathroom."

126,RES,patient,I was I was a mechanic at Chrysler's.
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and during your work, were you ever exposed to any chemicals or any kind of in your"
126,RES,patient,Not that I'm aware of.
126,RES,doctor,OK. And how long have you been smoking for?
126,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I was a teenager when I started."
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and how much do you smoke on a on a daily basis?"
126,RES,patient,"I smoke, I smoke a pack a day"
126,RES,doctor,OK. Have you at all tried to quit before?
126,RES,patient,"I can't quit. It's not gonna happen. A lot of people have told me try to quit but I I just can't live without it and I'm 75 now, you know. Like I'm not gonna live a lot longer anyway."
126,RES,doctor,"Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually. we can talk about that more as well."
126,RES,patient,Sure
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
126,RES,patient,No
126,RES,doctor,Do you drink?
126,RES,patient,No
126,RES,doctor,"No, OK, so yeah, those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me?"
126,RES,patient,"No, I just I guess I need to be admitted right? Just like those other COPD exacerbations? I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days"
126,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission."
126,RES,patient,Sure.
126,RES,doctor,"OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?"
126,RES,patient,"Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen."
126,RES,doctor,"Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there."
126,RES,patient,Sure.
126,RES,doctor,"Great, I'll be with you shortly."
127,RES,doctor,"I was uh, wondering what I could help you with today?"
127,RES,patient,"Yeah hi, um, I have been coughing nonstop for the past three days, and today I have been feeling very short of breath. So I just wanted to get it all checked out."
127,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. And, so you said the cough started uh, three days ago. Were there any triggers to the cough or anything that, uh that changed three days ago?"
127,RES,patient,"No, nothing that I can think of um, I have, like the only thing that I've been doing is going to the grocery stores, uh the bank, and laundromat. Um, and once I ran all these errands, like, I just started having this coughing fit that hasn't stopped."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, uh, has the cough gotten any better, or stayed the same, or gotten worse these past three days?"
127,RES,patient,"Uh, it seems like it's getting worse."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, are you bringing up any uh, sputum or phlegm?"
127,RES,patient,"Um yes, it's yellow."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, is this um, any different from before? Like have you had a cough in the past and, and brought up phlegm, or is this entirely new for you?"
127,RES,patient,"Um no, this has happened to me before, um, like I don't know, like maybe a year or two years back. Uh, and it kind of feels the same, but just a little bit worse."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and uh, have you seen any blood in the sputum?"
127,RES,patient,"No, no blood."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and you mentioned you've been short of breath as well. Uh, how has that come on?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, it was, I, I don't know if it's because of all the coughing that I've been doing, but it just started this morning."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, and have you been experiencing uh shortness of breath um, on exertion otherwise, like prior to this?"
127,RES,patient,"Um no, no."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay. And have you had any shortness of breath after, like if you lie down flat?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, no, not that I've noticed"
127,RES,doctor,"All right, and have you had a wheeze?"
127,RES,patient,"A little bit, yeah."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay um, uh, and have you had any um, infectious-like symptoms such as like red eyes, runny nose, or, or a sore throat?"
127,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, have you had any, any chest pain?"
127,RES,patient,"Nope, nothing like that."
127,RES,doctor,"Have you had any lightheadedness or, or feeling dizzy?"
127,RES,patient,No.
127,RES,doctor,"Or feeling like your heart's racing or, or beating really fast?"

127,RES,patient,"No, that's pretty much it."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and in the past, have you um, been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, I have diabetes, I have high blood pressure and I have high cholesterol."
127,RES,doctor,"I see. Alright, and do you take uh, medications for those things?"
127,RES,patient,"Yes, so I am on ramipril for the high blood pressure, rosuvastatin for the cholesterol, and insulin for the diabetes."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, thank you. And uh, you mentioned you had a similar episode in the past. Um, what, uh, were you diagnosed with COPD before?"
127,RES,patient,"I was, I was diagnosed with COPD about five years back."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, did you have pulmonary function tests for this? The test where you had to breathe into a tube."
127,RES,patient,"Um yeah, I had that done like five years ago."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, alright um, just wanted to see if it was uh like formally diagnosed. Sometimes people uh, um, yeah, it's important to have that, uh, those tests done. Um, and do you have any allergies?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, no none. None, yeah."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and uh, are your immunizations up to date?"

127,RES,doctor,"Okay, that's good. It sounds like the rehab went well."
127,RES,patient,Yeah.
127,RES,doctor,"And uh, right now, can you tell me um, a little bit about your living situation? Like where you're living and who you're living with?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, I live by myself in an apartment on the 1st floor."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, um and, do you smoke cigarettes?"
127,RES,patient,"Uh no, I quit two years ago."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, and that's, that's great. Um, prior to that, how long did you smoke for, and how much?"
127,RES,patient,"Oh, for like 40-plus years um, I used to smoke a pack a day."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, well that's great that uh, that you quit, so congratulations."
127,RES,patient,Thank you.
127,RES,doctor,And do you drink alcohol?
127,RES,patient,"I drink once in a while. Like maybe every other day, I'll have a glass of wine."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, and um, uh anybody, or sorry, have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?"
127,RES,patient,Uh no.
127,RES,doctor,You said you went to the stores and stuff like that.
127,RES,patient,"Yeah, maybe from there, yeah."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, and have you traveled anywhere else, outside of the city?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, not recently, no."
127,RES,doctor,"Alright, um, and any exposures to any like dust, chemicals, things like that?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, I live in an old building so maybe. Um, but it hasn't bugged me before."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, uh, and are you working currently or, or retired?"
127,RES,patient,I'm retired.
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, well, what did you do before?"
127,RES,patient,"I used to work uh, on the assembly line for Chrysler."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, were there any exposures uh, there that you were aware of, like things that you were breathing in?"
127,RES,patient,"Uh not that I was aware of, but they were always like smoke and fumes and things like that because it was like a factory, so maybe."
127,RES,doctor,"Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, and in the family, are there, anybody who, who's had problems with their hearts or lungs?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, my mom had lung cancer when she was 50. And, like, all the, like diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol runs on my, ran on my father's side of the family."
127,RES,doctor,"I see, did anybody have uh, heart attacks or, or stroke?"
127,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, so my father had a heart attack when he was 49. Uh, stroke I'm not too sure about."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, thank you. And, um, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Um, was there anything else that you wanted to add that I maybe forgot?"
127,RES,patient,"Um, no, that's about it, but I, how can I treat myself now? How do I make this cough go away?"
127,RES,doctor,"For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab."
127,RES,patient,"Okay, okay for sure."
127,RES,doctor,"Okay, so uh, we'll get that started."
127,RES,patient,Okay. Thank you so much.
128,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
128,RES,patient,Hi I'm coming in because I've had this like on and off runny nose and stuffy nose for the past week. Um and I just came to make sure it's not something serious like Covid.
128,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah no I completely understand why you might be worried um with everything going on. So just to get an idea of the timeline, so when did this start?"
128,RES,patient,"So it started about I'd say, seven days ago."
128,RES,doctor,"Seven days ago, OK. And was it just a runny nose that started or did you have any other symptoms?"

128,RES,patient,"Um I don't think it's improving. It's changed 'cause it used to be stuffy, now it's more of a runny nose. Um but yeah, it seems to be runny, like it's the same amount of runniness for the past couple of days."

128,RES,patient,Uh I drink like a glass of wine every other day.
128,RES,doctor,"OK. Um yeah, so those were some of the questions I had for you. I know it's a bit concerning because of the pandemic going on and um a runny nose can be a symptom uh of Covid as well, but uh it can also be a symptom of just the common cold or any other virus. Um but since you're having, uh you're symptomatic right now, we will definitely get like a Covid swab test done for you."
128,RES,patient,OK.
128,RES,doctor,"And if you start having any, just monitor for your symptoms. Um you should have the test back within 48 hours. Until then, uh at least for 14 days you should try to isolate in your own room, wear a mask around uh your partner, uh and not go outside, so just self isolate."
128,RES,patient,OK.
128,RES,doctor,"And and then you will get the test results back in a, hopefully in a few days. So do you have any questions at all?"

129,RES,doctor,"So you've had this, when did this start?"
129,RES,patient,"Uh, I would say probably during the winter uh it, it kind of started, where I started having um, just coughing fits when I'm walking to school and then also during like gym class I started having these coughing fits and sometimes I also felt like I couldn't breathe."
129,RES,doctor,"Um, okay. Okay, what did you, is there anything, so it's basically worse when you're um, doing some sort of an exercise such as walking um, or being in the gym class, and it's also worse in the cold?"

129,RES,patient,"Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own."
129,RES,doctor,And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?
129,RES,patient,"Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't."

129,RES,doctor,Are you taking any medications?
129,RES,patient,"Uh, no medications."
129,RES,doctor,Are you still using the eczema cream?
129,RES,patient,"No, no. That kind of just went away on its own, or like right after I used the cream. Like it's good now."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, good. Are you allergic to anything?"
129,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. Maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes, in the springtime."
129,RES,doctor,What happens then?
129,RES,patient,"Um, just sometimes like uh, I don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like I, I do get some, I guess I do get like some nasal congestion and things like that."
129,RES,doctor,"Um, have you ever seen an allergist?"
129,RES,patient,"No, I haven't."
129,RES,doctor,"No. Uh, who prescribed the cream for the eczema?"
129,RES,patient,"Um, just a, it was like at a walk-in clinic."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Um alright, and do you have any family history of any um, lung-related problems? Or any other problems?"
129,RES,patient,"Um, my older sister has asthma, and uh, I don't know if anyone else in the family has asthma. Um, I think my father has high blood pressure."
129,RES,doctor,"Alright, and you mentioned that things are going well at school. Um, who do you live with at home?"
129,RES,patient,"Yeah so I live with my older sister, and my mom and dad."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. And things are good at home? Do you feel safe?"
129,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I feel completely safe."
129,RES,doctor,Any concerns about bullying at school?
129,RES,patient,"No, no, not at all."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay are you uh, are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs?"
129,RES,patient,"No, no, my parents would kill me."
129,RES,doctor,What about alcohol?
129,RES,patient,"Uh, I'll come, I've, I haven't tried it um, yet, at all."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?"
129,RES,patient,"No, no."
129,RES,doctor,"Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?"
129,RES,patient,"Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me."
129,RES,doctor,Does it wake you up at night?
129,RES,patient,"No, so far no. I, I like, I get pretty good sleep."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?"
129,RES,patient,"Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total."
129,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about."
129,RES,patient,Yeah.
129,RES,doctor,"Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?"
129,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't have any questions at all. Thank you so much."
130,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
130,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've had uh, a cough that's been um, bugging me for the last several months now, and more recently I've noticed that I've started to bring up a bit more, or a little bit of blood as well."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, well that's not good. So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?"
130,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay and um, the blood in the cough, when did that start?"
130,RES,patient,"So that started about, uh, about two weeks ago."
130,RES,doctor,"Two weeks ago, okay. Um, how much blood are you coughing up like, if uh, like is it the size of your palm, is it more than that, less than that?"
130,RES,patient,"Uh, I would say less than that, like each time there's maybe to about the size of I don't know, uh, like a looney. So like inside of the palm."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, sure. Um, and are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with your cough?"
130,RES,patient,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I have been. It's uh, you know, I thought that was just kind of me getting older and the smoking, but I've certainly been able, I haven't been able to walk as far and even uh, to the end of the driveway getting the mail now is, is pretty, I'll get short of breath. Before I used to be able to walk a lot further than that, just a couple of years ago."
130,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Um, and sorry you said, you mentioned, you mentioned you had some wheezing as well, right?"
130,RES,patient,"Um, I haven't really had any, noticed any wheezing."
130,RES,doctor,"No, okay. Um, and have you had a fever recently?"
130,RES,patient,No.
130,RES,doctor,Weight loss?
130,RES,patient,"Um yeah, now that you mention it, maybe, maybe a little bit, like 5 to 10 pounds over the last, the last month."
130,RES,doctor,"Last month, okay. Um, any chills, fever, sorry, chills, or night sweats?"
130,RES,patient,"No um, no, I haven't had anything like that."

130,RES,doctor,"Okay um, and then change in your smell or taste?"
130,RES,patient,"No, that's been normal."

130,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any chest pain."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay. Um, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like that."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, how about calf pain when you walk, like more than a block or two?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any symptoms like that."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, any changes to your bowel movements?"
130,RES,patient,No things have been normal there.

130,RES,patient,"Every once in a while, I'll get a headache, but it's, they're pretty mild. Usually I'll take an Advil and they go away."
130,RES,doctor,"Sure, um, how about dizziness or fainting spells?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like that."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, um, any confusion or memory loss?"
130,RES,patient,"Uh, I guess I um, forget things a little more easily now, but, that's just part of getting older."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, sure. Um, and then other questions I have for you, are um, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any major medical, medical conditions?"
130,RES,patient,"Uh, I have arthritis um, in my knees and uh, hands, um so I have a lot of pain from that sometimes, and I also have high blood pressure and um, GERD."
130,RES,doctor,Okay.
130,RES,patient,"Or acid reflux, yeah."
130,RES,doctor,Sure. Do you take any medications for these things?
130,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, I'll take Tylenol um, for the arthritis, and sometimes use some like, topical creams for my knees. Um and uh I, I take amlodipine as well, I think, for the blood pressure."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay. Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
130,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I remember getting one not too long ago, actually. Well, seven years ago I guess now, but I didn't realize, that we uh, had to get anymore."
130,RES,doctor,"Um, so yeah, after you turn 65, they should've given you the Shingrix for shingles and pneumococcal vaccine, does that sound familiar?"
130,RES,patient,"Yeah it does. Yeah, I just didn't know about them until that time."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay yeah, sure. Any allergies that you have?"
130,RES,patient,"Uh, I don't think so."
130,RES,doctor,No. How about family history of lung or heart conditions?
130,RES,patient,"My uh, grandfather had, had lung cancer. And he was in his uh, 70s when he, when he passed away, I remember."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay. And do you currently smoke?"
130,RES,patient,"I do, yes. Yeah, I, I smoke um, I don't know, maybe half a pack a day now, which is, it's a lot less than I used to. I was smoking two packs a day at one point."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, well congratulations on cutting down. Um, yeah, if you need help cutting that down even more, let us know, we have resources that you may be able to use."
130,RES,patient,"Yeah, absolutely. Thank you."
130,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no problem. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that?"
130,RES,patient,"Yeah since I, oh CBD drops, I, at night I find that helps with uh, sleep and, and the pain in my knees."
130,RES,doctor,"Oh okay, are those prescribed drops?"
130,RES,patient,"Um. well I do buy, I get them from uh, like the uh, the OCS store, I think they're called."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay yeah. Okay, that's good that you're getting them from, like an official store."
130,RES,patient,"Yeah they're for, they were, uh, my friend said that they worked for her, and so I just gave them a try and I, I found that they've helped."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, good. Um, and where do you live right now? And who do you live with?"
130,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I live in uh, in an apartment with my, with my husband."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, And any like, old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos in this apartment?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I don't believe so. It's relatively new. We just moved out of our house, uh, just to make it a little easier on us."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay yeah, for sure. Um, have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. I've been spending a lot of time at at home uh, with my husband, and he's been okay."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, good. How about travel?"
130,RES,patient,"No, we've been pretty scared with uh, COVID and all that, so we've been staying, staying home for the most part."
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
130,RES,patient,"No, I was just really concerned when I started to see um, the blood coming up more recently, and so I was just hoping to get this figured out."
130,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?"
130,RES,patient,That sounds like a good plan. Thank you.
130,RES,doctor,"Okay, great. No problem."
131,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've had this cough that started within the last day and uhm, I've also been particularly short of breath as well."
131,RES,doctor,"OK. Can you tell me about the, the cough, how, is it dry cough or wet cough?"
131,RES,patient,"It's wet, I've been bringing up, uh, sputum that's uh, It's just, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth when bringing it up."
131,RES,doctor,What color is the sputum?
131,RES,patient,"It's kind of, uh, like, yellowish green, type color."
131,RES,doctor,Havey you noticed any blood?
131,RES,patient,"No, I haven't seen any blood."
131,RES,doctor,"And it only started yesterday. What about the difficulties breathing, when did that start?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, that started really within the last twelve hours or so."
131,RES,doctor,And can you tell me if it's gotten better or worse since then?
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's been, it's been getting worse, uhm, and the phlegm, also smells really bad."
131,RES,doctor,"OK. When do you have difficult, like, is there anything that makes the, shortness of breath, worse?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, if I, uhm, when I was having a cigarette earlier today, it got a bit worse and when I went out to get the Mail today I, I just couldn't do it. I, I had to just sit down."
131,RES,doctor,"And that what happened to you before, right?"
131,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, and say two days ago, were you feeling perfectly fine?"
131,RES,patient,"I was yeah, I wasn't sick at all."

131,RES,doctor,"OK, and any uh diarrhea or Constipation?"
131,RES,patient,"Uhm no, I haven't anything like that."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, any sore throat?"
131,RES,patient,"Uhm, no."
131,RES,doctor,"OK alright uhm, any other symptoms that I haven't talked about, that you experienced over the past day?"
131,RES,patient,"No, it's really been, uhm, yeah, this cough and bringing up this, this sputum and being short of breath."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, can you tell me about your past uh, medical history, do you have any medical conditions?"
131,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, I have uhm, high blood pressure."

131,RES,patient,"And, uhm, high cholesterol as well."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, ok."
131,RES,patient,"And I've also been, had issues with anxiety in the past as well."
131,RES,doctor,"In terms of medications, are you taking any?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, I take uhm, an ACE inhibitor, statin, uhm, and uh, medication for my stomach, I think, like Pantoprazole."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled?"
131,RES,patient,"Uh, it kind of, it bugs me most days, its not so bad, I mean, sometimes I'll get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the, in my mouth, but it depends on what I eat so I really try to stay away from some, some foods."
131,RES,doctor,"So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, I still get it. It's definitely helped though it was a lot worse before, uh starting it. I've been on been on it now for a few years."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, and as for your anxiety, do you ever get panic attacks?"
131,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any, any panic attacks."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. Do you have any allergies?"
131,RES,patient,No.
131,RES,doctor,"OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual?"
131,RES,patient,"Well, yeah, I mean yesterday I, or, yeah, I had a bit more to drink than, uh, usual, more alcohol I mean. So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure."
131,RES,doctor,"It could potentially. Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink?"
131,RES,patient,"I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that."
131,RES,doctor,Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way?
131,RES,patient,"I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later."
131,RES,patient,OK.
131,RES,doctor,"And, uh, do you smoke?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit."
131,RES,doctor,"No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah I have been, have been trying, just too, too darn expensive these days, so, been trying to cut back."
131,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah, that's fair, alright. What about marijuana? Do you consume marijuana?"
131,RES,patient,"No, I don't."
131,RES,doctor,Any recreational drugs?
131,RES,patient,Nope.
131,RES,doctor,"Alright, do you have any family history of any medical problems?"
131,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, my, my father had, uh, he ended up having liver disease actually, he passed away from that I think. And he had heart problems too. He was a lifelong smoker and didn't really, didn't really take care of himself."
131,RES,doctor,"Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor?"
131,RES,patient,"Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though."
131,RES,doctor,"Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?"
131,RES,patient,"I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, I live with my wife."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances, or shoveling snow or cleaning the house, or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities?"
131,RES,patient,"Yeah, we moved, uhm, actually into an apartment last year. It's made it a lot easier in terms of the housework and that sort of thing. But I've been able to, uhm, I do the the grocery shopping and share the the chores around, around the house. I do, I'll use a cane sometimes. I, I injured my knee a number of years ago, but other than that, things are OK."
131,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good to hear. That reminds me, have you had any surgeries in the past?"
131,RES,patient,"Just on my, my left knee. I had a left knee replacement a few years ago."
131,RES,doctor,"OK alright and have you any had, had any hospitalizations?"
131,RES,patient,No.
131,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, uhm, so sounds like you've had a day of this wet cough with the, this, a bad smelling sort of sputum that's, that's yellowish green in color, and you've also had difficulties breathing for the past twelve hours, uh, so much so that you can't even go out to get mail and your hearts been racing. It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?"
131,RES,patient,"No, I haven't."
131,RES,doctor,"And you don't have any allergies to any, correct?"
131,RES,patient,Correct.
131,RES,doctor,"Alright, OK, we'll also do a physical exam just to give a listen to your, to your lungs and see how they're doing and then go from there. Do you have any questions for me?"
131,RES,patient,"No, that sounds good. Thank you."
132,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'm just coming in with my son, he's been having, he's been complaining of just, seems like pain in his right ear for the last I would say three to four days. And it seems like he's just more irritable, just not himself right now."
132,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?"
132,RES,patient,I would say four days now.
132,RES,doctor,"Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss?"
132,RES,patient,"Uh, no, he still responds when I call his name."
132,RES,doctor,"OK and, have you noticed any fluid coming out of his ears?"
132,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
132,RES,doctor,Is it more like one side of his ears or is it both ears?
132,RES,patient,It's just his right ear.
132,RES,doctor,"Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?"
132,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't see any swelling or redness at all."
132,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?"
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, I tried to take a look with a flashlight. I couldn't really see too much."
132,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?"
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, so that, kind of like last week he was recovering from, I think it was just a cold and he had a runny nose and just was a bit congested. But then over the last week it kind of just resolved. But then this week he started having just this ear pain."
132,RES,doctor,OK. Any fevers?
132,RES,patient,"Uh, no, not that I, I haven't measured anything and he hasn't mentioned any, like he hasn't felt cold or anything like that."
132,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss over the past month or so?"
132,RES,patient,No.
132,RES,doctor,"No, any change in his hair or nails, like rashes or, sorry, or skin?"
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, no, I haven't seen any changes in the skin."
132,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his vision or smell or taste?"
132,RES,patient,No.
132,RES,doctor,"No, OK. His runny nose, what color is it?"
132,RES,patient,"It was mainly, uh, it seemed to me like it was mainly clear when it was happening, like he wasn't bringing up any yellow or green material."

132,RES,patient,"Uh no, no complications, it was just a vaginal birth at 39 weeks and we didn't need to stay in the hospital at all afterwards."
132,RES,doctor,"OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, I don't know if, uh, like last time we did get some antibiotics. I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?"
132,RES,doctor,"Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?"
132,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
132,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, no worries."

133,MSK,patient,Um no just what can I do for my foot how do I make the swelling go down?
133,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well."
133,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
133,MSK,doctor,"Alright, thank you, we will get that started."

So for um, in Canada or anybody or in Ontario, at least, anybody who's older than 65, it's recommended to get this vaccine to protect against certain types of bacterial infections type which can cause pneumonia.

135,RES,patient,"Um, no, just um, what do you think the problem is? I've never felt this bad with my shortness of breath before."
135,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath."
135,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good, thank you."
136,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
136,RES,patient,"Um I just uh I have, I have a cough that I've had for a couple of days and like normally if I had a cough or cold, I would just like stay home and rest, but just because you know there's like Covid I I wanted to make sure, like I wanted to get checked out."
136,RES,doctor,"Yeah, of course that that was a great idea. Thanks for coming in. Um how long have you had this cough for?"
136,RES,patient,"Uh it's like 2 days. Like maybe three days ago, I started to feel like my throat was dry and I was like, oh, maybe I need to drink more water or something and then the next day I started like actually coughing."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
136,RES,patient,Yeah it's really dry.
136,RES,doctor,"Really dry, OK. So no sputum, no blood that you're bringing up?"
136,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that. It's just kind of annoying."
136,RES,doctor,"Yeah, um do you have any wheeziness associated with your coughing?"
136,RES,patient,I don't think so.
136,RES,doctor,"No, OK. No shortness of breath?"
136,RES,patient,"No, no, I've been, I feel like I've been tired, but I don't think it's been actually hard to breathe. I just feel overall like really tired."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and have you tried anything for the cough, like um over the counter cough syrup or anything like that?"
136,RES,patient,"Uh like I have, I've just been drinking tea and just like tea with honey just to like make it feel better. I I didn't like take any medicine."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you, have you noticed that there are any triggers for your cough, like the cold, or dust, or any like environmental triggers?"
136,RES,patient,"I mean, I've been, just because of Covid and stuff, I've been staying home ever since I had it."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you find that it's constantly there or um is it worse during a particular time of day, like morning, afternoon, or evening?"
136,RES,patient,It's kind of just been there
136,RES,doctor,"OK, and um is it getting worse, do you think?"
136,RES,patient,"I think so. I think like today is worse than yesterday, and the day before that, it just felt like dry and then and then like the next day I started coughing, so yeah."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
136,RES,patient,"I mean, I've had coughs before, um this one feels like particularly dry, but uh like it, it's not too different than like when I'm just like, like had a cough in other years."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um and you mentioned that your throat was also dry. Do you have a sore throat?"
136,RES,patient,"Maybe a little bit this morning, yeah, like at first it just felt dry like I was thinking like, oh it's like you know I need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels, now it's starting to think, I feel a little bit sore, I think."
136,RES,doctor,"OK, um is it hard for you to swallow foods or fluids?"

136,RES,doctor,"I mean yeah, some people have it, some people don't. Um I guess people with Covid present in different ways, yeah yeah, do you have a fever at all?"

Um and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like last week and I I don't know, I questioned it but I I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them, or like I don't know if they were actually sick or something. So, I might have been, and we wear masks and everything, like we're really good, but I don't know, I feel like the offices aren't like super, like the air flow's not that great."
136,RES,doctor,Yeah.
136,RES,patient,"So yeah, I think that's another reason I was concerned, that I I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story."

136,RES,patient,Uh not that I can think of.
136,RES,doctor,"No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?"
136,RES,patient,"Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not."
136,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure and I, and I think it's good that you came in."
136,RES,patient,Awesome.
136,RES,doctor,"Alright, thank you."

137,RES,patient,Yes it has.
137,RES,doctor,"OK, and how often are you coughing?"
137,RES,patient,"I um, I'd say a few times an hour now. Uh when it first started, it was a bit more intermittent, but now it's happening um all day long and throughout the night as well, it interrupted my sleep last night."
137,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, um is it a dry cough or are you producing sputum?"

137,RES,patient,"No, interestingly, nothing like that seems to really make it worse. It's just been um kinda coughing all day."
137,RES,doctor,"OK, and um has anything made it better? Have you tried anything for this cough?"
137,RES,patient,Uh I tried um drinking some uh like tea and some other cough syrups and it didn't didn't help.

137,RES,doctor,"OK, OK good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own or anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?"
137,RES,patient,"Um no, that, I was just worried about uh Covid."
137,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so that's definitely top on the list right now for things that we have to rule you out for. Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER. So how does that sound?"
137,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's really informative. Thank you."
137,RES,doctor,"Alright, take care."
137,RES,patient,Thank you.

138,RES,patient,"Um, it is mostly during the day and in the evenings, it doesn't wake me up from sleep."
138,RES,doctor,"OK, and any triggers that you've notice 5 days ago or anything that changed at that time to bring on the cough?"

138,RES,patient,"No, that's it. What do you think I have?"
138,RES,doctor,"Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can."

140,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then you mentioned that with walking you're having a limp currently?"
140,MSK,patient,Yes.
140,MSK,doctor,"OK, so we have an antalgic gates with an inability to bear weight as well. OK, so the that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today and based on these features it is starting like it could be either an ankle fracture or an ankle sprain. But because of the pin-point tenderness or that you're finding on the lateral side as well as some of the the inability to bear weight as you're describing it'll be important to get an X-Ray to make sure that there's not a fracture. Um and yeah, and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting so that to make sure that we're offloading the area for the bones to heal, but we'll see what the X-Ray shows."
140,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds great, thank you."
140,MSK,doctor,Thank you.
141,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
141,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I just came in today, I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old, and I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years, but just recently, just during the winter I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back and now, especially over the last few months whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again and recently for the last, I would say a week I've also been having some wheezing as well. So yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything is alright."
141,RES,doctor,"OK sure, so just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?"
141,RES,patient,"So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old."
141,RES,doctor,"13, OK, and you've been using Puffers since?"
141,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. So can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you're experiencing right now? OK, so you said some shortness of breath, when did that start?"
141,RES,patient,"So yeah, in the last, I would say two months I've noticed it, similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running, I get short of breath very easily. But at rest I'm fine, I don't have any trouble, but I've noticed it for the last few months."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities?"
141,RES,patient,Mhm.
141,RES,doctor,OK. And do you feel wheezy as well?
141,RES,patient,"Yeah, in the last one to two weeks I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Mainly during like, if I'm running or still, with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah, so that's been an issue for the last couple of weeks."
141,RES,doctor,"So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheezing eventually resolve?"
141,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, so I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, how long does it last before it goes away?"
141,RES,patient,"Probably, at least, like I would say 10 to 15 minutes."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, OK."
141,RES,patient,Until I'm fully kind of recovered.
141,RES,doctor,"Ok, Ok. Are You coughing as well?"
141,RES,patient,"Uhm, yeah, when I'm exercising, that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day otherwise, I'm not coughing."
141,RES,doctor,"OK. And, when you cough, do you bring up phlegm or is it more like a dry cough?"
141,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, and do you feel like your heart's racing?"
141,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
141,RES,doctor,"No, you don't feel like you're breathing a lot more than usual?"
141,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, Do you still have puffers at home?"
141,RES,patient,"I actually, like I haven't used them for a while so no I don't have any puffers."
141,RES,doctor,OK. Any weight loss recently?
141,RES,patient,No.
141,RES,doctor,"No, fevers or chills?"
141,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, any rashes or changes in your hair or skin or nails?"
141,RES,patient,"I do, I have just, uh, eczeme, I've had it for most of my life now, so especially during the winter I do get some irritation, especially on my hands. So yeah, some rashes, but that's about it."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?"
141,RES,patient,"No, no changes."
141,RES,doctor,"Stuffy nose, runny nose, changes in your taste?"
141,RES,patient,No.

141,RES,doctor,Chest pain?
141,RES,patient,No chest pain.
141,RES,doctor,Do you find you get short of breath when you're laying down or it wakes you up at night?
141,RES,patient,"No, just when I'm exercising, especially running."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, sure, any dizziness or fainting spells?"
141,RES,patient,No.
141,RES,doctor,Any headaches?
141,RES,patient,No headaches.
141,RES,doctor,"Any like, reflux, heartburn?"
141,RES,patient,No.

141,RES,patient,No.
141,RES,doctor,Changes to your bowel movements?
141,RES,patient,Nope.
141,RES,doctor,"OK, so you mentioned you were diagnosed with asthma and eczema in the past, any other longstanding medical conditions that you have?"
141,RES,patient,"Uh, no those those are the only ones."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, any allergies?"
141,RES,patient,"I do have, I think like, just seasonal allergies. I don't know if I'm allergic to pollen, but during the spring time I get allergies and then during the winter now I'm getting some of these symptoms that I'm talking about. So yeah, but none to any medications that I know of."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're not getting any night time symptoms, and you're only getting day time symptoms with activity, right?"
141,RES,patient,Yeah.
141,RES,doctor,Has this prevented you from going to work or school?
141,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, so I, just this past week, I usually do my running, like morning workout right before work, and just one of the days after I worked out, I felt just terrible, with this coughing and short of breath so I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own, so for the other days I have been going to work."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good. And, alright, and then any medications that you're on?"
141,RES,patient,"I'm on a, Just one of those steroid creams for my eczema."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
141,RES,patient,Yep.
141,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
141,RES,patient,"No heart conditions, but yeah asthma is pretty big in my family, as well as eczema, like my mom has it, my sister has it, so yeah asthma is pretty big."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, how about cancers?"
141,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, I don't think anyone in the family has any cancers."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you smoke?"

141,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?"
141,RES,patient,"No, I don't drink alcohol, no drugs, yeah, I'm pretty, I like to stay very fit and healthy so nothing like that."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"
141,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of. I live by myself in my apartment. I've been working from home. I work as a programmer and so I only go outside for runs and stuff for groceries, so I haven't really seen anyone sick around me."
141,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"
141,RES,patient,"No, I've mainly been at home."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, good, and where's home?"
141,RES,patient,Home is in Hamilton Ontario and I've just been working from home.
141,RES,doctor,"OK, do you live in a house, apartment, who do you live with?"
141,RES,patient,"I just live in an apartment by myself. I did have a roommate, like uh, that moved out just a couple of months ago. But yeah, right now I'm just by myself."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, any old carpets, pets, mold or asbestos in the house?"
141,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
141,RES,doctor,"OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?"
141,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back."
141,RES,doctor,"Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting."
141,RES,patient,OK.
141,RES,doctor,"As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?"
141,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
141,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no problem."
142,RES,doctor,"I understand that you've had a cough, can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
142,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've had this cough now, it's been going on for about two weeks, just, just hasn't gone away."
142,RES,doctor,"Uhm, oK, can you tell me a little bit more about this cough? Is it dry or wet?"
142,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah it's been, uhm, mix, it's been dry sometimes and I have had a little bit of sputum production recently, uh, it's been mostly clear though."
142,RES,doctor,Has the cough gotten worse over the past two weeks?
142,RES,patient,"No, it's been about the same."
142,RES,doctor,"Uhm, and have you had any blood that came up with the sputum?"
142,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed any blood."
142,RES,doctor,"Alright, what about any other symptoms over the past two weeks? Have you had, have you had any fevers or chills?"
142,RES,patient,"Not, no."
142,RES,doctor,"No. OK. And any uhm, I guess, any runny nose?"
142,RES,patient,"Yeah, my nose was a bit runny last week, but it's, that's better now."
142,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, uhm, it's just, OK last week, what else, what other symptoms did you have last week?"
142,RES,patient,"Yeah, I had a sore throat and a little bit of a headache as well, uhm, and, and some aches and fatigue. Those were uh, yeah, that was last week for about three days, and then I started to feel better. But I still have this cough, that, it's still going on."
142,RES,doctor,"So those other symptoms that you had last week that lasted about three days, are they all gone? are you still feeling fatigued or having a headache?"
142,RES,patient,"Those are both, yeah, they're gone."
142,RES,doctor,"Hmm, It's only the cough?"
142,RES,patient,Yeah I just have the cough.
142,RES,doctor,"Is there any time, any specific time of the day that it's worse or better? Anything that triggers it?"
142,RES,patient,"Uhm, maybe like, maybe when I went out into the cold or, uhm, like, when I went for a run where I really kind of exerted myself, it brought it on, but other than those things, nothing."
142,RES,doctor,"OK, but you're otherwise feeling better?"
142,RES,patient,"Yeah, for the most part, yeah, feeling better, but I still have a cough."
142,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, have you had any chest pain?"
142,RES,doctor,Any palpitations? Do you feel like your heart's racing?
142,RES,patient,"Uhm, no. Nothing like that."

142,RES,patient,"Alright, so I live with a few roommates. I'm just finishing up my undergraduate degree."
142,RES,doctor,"Yeah, that's great. Have you had any contact with anyone who was sick recently?"
142,RES,patient,"No, not that I could think of, I mean we went out one night last week and that's kind of when I had those other symptoms for a few days after that."
142,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Uhm and have you traveled outside the city or country?"
142,RES,patient,"No, I haven't."
142,RES,doctor,"No, ok. Do you drink alcohol?"

142,RES,patient,No.
142,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, OK alright, so that's all that I, I wanted to know. It sounds like you had a, you had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there, and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise you're feeling well, you don't have any other symptoms. Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that. I'll also do a physical exam and, and see how you're doing and then we can go from there."
142,RES,patient,"OK, great, thank you."
143,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
143,RES,patient,"Hi there, I, I've had this cough that started um, three days ago, and over these past couple of days, I've just been really achy all over and so, I've had a headache as well."

143,RES,patient,"Yeah, so that, about three or four days ago um, it started to come on, yeah."
143,RES,doctor,"Okay, and then how about the headache?"
143,RES,patient,That's been more in the last two days.
143,RES,doctor,"Two days, okay, and then the uh, muscle ache?"
143,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's been there for about two, yeah about two or three days. I wake up in the morning and I've been feeling like really fatigued and achy."
143,RES,doctor,"Um, the cough, is it dry or you're bringing up phlegm?"

143,RES,doctor,"Yeah um, sides of your head, okay. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how, how would you rate it?"

143,RES,patient,"No, that's it. I was just uh, I mean concerned about COVID. I've been hearing about this new variant and stuff on the news so, a little bit worried."
143,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. We will definitely um, take a swab from you today and we'll see um, what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"
143,RES,patient,That sounds good. Thank you.
143,RES,doctor,"Okay great, thank you."
144,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
144,RES,patient,"Hi, I'm um, I'm just, so I am here because I have this cough that I've had for the past um, week and a half, and I'm just uh, I usually don't come in with symptoms this minor, but because it's, because we're in the middle of a pandemic, I thought I should come in and get checked out."
144,RES,doctor,"Okay, yeah, so it's been going on for like more than a week. Um, can you describe to me what kind of cough you're having? Is it like a wet cough or a dry cough?"

144,RES,doctor,"Okay, and has it been getting worse over the, over the time period you described?"
144,RES,patient,"Um, it's kind of the same."

144,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
144,RES,doctor,"Okay, and is your cough like constant or does it come and go?"

144,RES,patient,No.
144,RES,doctor,No?
144,RES,patient,"I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID."
144,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good."

145,RES,patient,OK.
145,RES,doctor,"And although she doesn't have any family history of it, it can happen without family history as well. Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test. That will help us kind of understand uh if she has um asthma or not and then we can try her on um, it's called a short acting beta agonist, so it's a puffer."
145,RES,patient,OK.
145,RES,doctor,"And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her. Uh and if it um helps her then it's most likely that she does have asthma and she will need um that puffer and then she might also need another puffer, which is an inhaled corticosteroid, um for the future to decrease um the likelihood that this asthma gets worse in the future."
145,RES,patient,"OK, OK yeah thank you."
145,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no worries. So yeah, so yeah we'll get those tests done and then go from there."

And then I started getting a fever four days ago and it has been going on for the last couple of days as well. And the highest temperature I measured on myself was 38.8 degrees Celsius and yeah, so that, that's, that's my main concern right now."
147,RES,doctor,"OK and, since the sore throat started 5 days ago has it been getting better, worse or staying the same?"
147,RES,patient,"I would say it's getting worse. I have some pain with swallowing food as well as, like now, even when I'm talking a little, I'm getting some pain as well."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been able to maintain your appetite?"
147,RES,patient,I do feel like I've lost a bit of my appetite over the last three to four days.
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed any changes to your voice?"
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, I don't think so, not yet, I, but I think, like the way it's hurting right now, I feel like it's coming."
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, so have you notice any like neck swelling?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, now that you mention it, I, I do have like these two lumps on the right side of my neck, like kind of right below the jaw."
147,RES,doctor,OK. Are they painful?
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, not, not really. Like when I'm pressing on them they don't really hurt, but I definitely have two lumps."
147,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. We'll, certainly look into that on the physical exam. OK, and uh, and you mentioned that you've also been really tired over these last few days?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've, I haven't really had much of an appetite, kind of just, I've skipped work, just trying to take it easy like just napping the whole day, as much as I can."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and so you've been experiencing fatigue. Have you had any, any headaches?"
147,RES,patient,"No headaches, no."
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, how about any eye redness or runny nose, or?"
147,RES,patient,"Uh no, no runny nose, or, so I, I don't have headaches, but I, I, I think I was having some body aches just yesterday."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, so any particular area that, that's aching?"
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, not really. It's kind of just like a general, like I don't know if it was, it was because I was lying around the whole day, but just kind of a general pain throughout the body."
147,RES,doctor,"OK. And have you been experiencing any difficulties, or sorry, have you been experiencing any cough?"
147,RES,patient,"No, not really."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any shortness of breath or trouble breathing?"
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any wheezing?"
147,RES,patient,No wheezing.
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, and how about any chest pain?"
147,RES,patient,"No, no, no chest pain."
147,RES,doctor,"Have you had any heart palpitations or, or feeling like your heart's racing?"
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and, maybe you had any lightheadedness or, or dizziness?"
147,RES,patient,"Uh, no, not really."
147,RES,doctor,Have you had any abdominal pain?
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, actually, yeah, yesterday when I was, uhm, like when I was having the body pain, I also noticed a little bit of abdominal pain just, like on the upper, I would say upper left side."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and, and how would you describe this pain and how long has it been going on for?"
147,RES,patient,"Just since yesterday. It's, it's not really like, I would say it's more of a discomfort than a pain, but I definitely do feel like like something's just not right in that area."
147,RES,doctor,"I see, is there anything that you do that, that makes that, that feeling worse, or make, that make it better?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, like I, I try not to lie on that side. I have to go on to the other side."
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, did you notice this in the last couple of days as well?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, that, that just started yesterday."
147,RES,doctor,OK. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,How about any diarrhea?
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you had any fevers or, or sorry, yeah, you mentioned you had a fever of 38.2. And have you had any chills?"
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, no chills, well, yeah, I would say a couple nights ago I might have had some chills, but mainly it's just been, I've been feeling more hot and I have been kind of getting like night sweats."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, you've been having night sweats this week or have they been going on longer?"
147,RES,patient,"No, just, just this week."
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, have you had any changes to your weight over the last several months?"
147,RES,patient,"No, it's been pretty steady."
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, and the fever this week, has it been there the whole time, or has it come and gone?"
147,RES,patient,"It kind of comes and goes. I've probably taken temperatures like every day. But I would say it's definitely, for the last few days it's been more of a fever, like the nightsweats sensation. Before it was a bit fine, like, but the highest temperatures have been in the last few days."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?"
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, just like, I, I don't know, like I don't think there are any changes, but I did notice some, like kind of just pink, pink spots on my arm the other day."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, well uh, were they itchy?"
147,RES,patient,"No, they weren't really itchy. Just like a couple I would say like raised, not raised spots, just like flat, kind of pinkish spots."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and has that, has that spread anywhere or has it gone away?"
147,RES,patient,"No, hasn't really started spreading yet, I just noticed it on, on my arm, and I, I don't think it has really spread at all."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, this is on, on one arm?"
147,RES,patient,Yeah.
147,RES,doctor,"OK. And you've had some body aches, uh, have you had any joint pains?"
147,RES,patient,"No join pains, no."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you currently sexually active?"
147,RES,patient,Yes.
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about your partners or, or partner and I, and I was wondering if you use condoms?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I, I just have one partner right now, my fiance, and we Uh, I actually like have in an IUD, so like we, we don't use condoms, but like we're pretty honest and safe with each other. I fully trust him, like he doesn't have any partners or anything like that and I only have, I don't have any other partners as well."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
147,RES,patient,"No, never."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, any concerns currently? Any vaginal discharge or itchiness or, or pain?"
147,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been pregnant before?"
147,RES,patient,"No, I haven't no."
147,RES,doctor,OK. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
147,RES,patient,"Uhm, just uh, I have had just eczema in the past, but that, that's fairly stable. It's been treated, I don't really have it anymore."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, do you take any medications regularly?"
147,RES,patient,"Currently, no, no."
147,RES,doctor,Any allergies to medications?
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,"Alright, uhm, and any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,"OK. And could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like, who you live with, and, and where?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I'm just living with my fiance and that's, we're living in like a small apartment. And right now we're not really seeing anyone else really during the pandemic."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, so have you been around anybody who's been sick?"
147,RES,patient,"I just had to go into work like one day last week just to grab some of my stuff, but didn't really come into contact with anyone. My fiance does go to his work like a couple, like three or four times during the week, so I don't know if he got into contact with anyone, It's, it's hard to say."
147,RES,doctor,"Has he been sick at all? Like any, any cough, sore throat, anything, like that?"
147,RES,patient,"He did have a sore throat last week, but it kind of just went away on its own in a couple of days and compared to me, like, his was nothing really."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, uh. And have you traveled anywhere?"
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,And do you smoke cigarettes?
147,RES,patient,No.
147,RES,doctor,How about do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?
147,RES,patient,"Uh, probably smoke marijuana, just maybe once or twice a month."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, so it sounds like socially?"
147,RES,patient,Yeah.
147,RES,doctor,Do you use any other recreational drugs?
147,RES,patient,"No, nothing else."
147,RES,doctor,OK. And do you drink alcohol?
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, I, Probably have some red wine every other day, I would say."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, and this is like one glass or two?"
147,RES,patient,"Yeah, no, It's just like a normal glass of wine. Maybe, like we probably go through like a bottle between both of us, like every two weeks, maybe."
147,RES,doctor,"OK. And in the family, has there been anybody who's had any cancers?"
147,RES,patient,"No, no, no cancer is in the family."
147,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any genetic diseases or anything congenital that runs in the family?"
147,RES,patient,Not that I know of.
147,RES,doctor,"OK. So that was everything that I wanted to ask about on history, and so next we'll go ahead and get vitals and do a physical exam. But did you have anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about, or any other symptoms maybe?"
147,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. Do you think it can be covid at all?"
147,RES,doctor,"Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case."
147,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
147,RES,doctor,Thank you.
148,RES,doctor,So what brings you in?
148,RES,patient,"Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned."
148,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four?"
148,RES,patient,"Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?"
148,RES,patient,Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material.
148,RES,doctor,"White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?"
148,RES,patient,"It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat."
148,RES,doctor,"OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?"
148,RES,patient,I would say it's harsh.
148,RES,doctor,"Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?"
148,RES,patient,"Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?"
148,RES,patient,"No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine."
148,RES,doctor,"You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm?"
148,RES,patient,"No, no, I haven't noticed any blood."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes?"
148,RES,patient,"Not that I've noticed, no."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss?"
148,RES,patient,"Um, I don't think so."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, fevers?"
148,RES,patient,No.
148,RES,doctor,"OK, exhaustion?"
148,RES,patient,"Um yeah, I would say like for the last few months I am a bit more tired."
148,RES,doctor,"Mhmm OK, how about changes in your vision or hearing?"
148,RES,patient,"No, I haven't experienced that."
148,RES,doctor,How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose?
148,RES,patient,"Uh no, not really."
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste?"
148,RES,patient,Uh nope.
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Uh chest pain?"
148,RES,patient,"Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest."
148,RES,doctor,"Oh, yeah."
148,RES,patient,But it tends to go away with uh just some rest.
148,RES,doctor,"Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs?"
148,RES,patient,"I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and how long has that been going on?"
148,RES,patient,"Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells?"
148,RES,patient,No.
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion?"

148,RES,patient,No.
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding conditions? I know you said you have COPD, anything else?"
148,RES,patient,I do have high blood pressure.
148,RES,doctor,OK. Do you have something called congestive heart failure?
148,RES,patient,"Uh no, what's that?"
148,RES,doctor,"OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs."
148,RES,patient,"Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much."
148,RES,doctor,"OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications?"
148,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, so that's for your blood pressure?"
148,RES,patient,Yeah.
148,RES,doctor,"OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead."
148,RES,patient,"Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer."
148,RES,doctor,Yeah.
148,RES,patient,"And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?"
148,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?"
148,RES,patient,"Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while."
148,RES,doctor,OK. And do you have any allergies?
148,RES,patient,"Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once."
148,RES,doctor,"OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently?"
148,RES,patient,No.
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
148,RES,patient,Yep.
148,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, you're not quite at this age range yet, but uh we do recommend the pneumococcal vaccine when you turn 65. And um did you get the flu vaccine this year?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh yeah I did, with the pandemic going on, I usually don't get it, but I got it this year."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, good good. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
148,RES,patient,"Uhm, lung conditions I don't think so. Heart conditions, uh my father did have a heart attack in his 60s, but he's fine. He's he's living right now."
148,RES,doctor,"OK OK, any cancers?"
148,RES,patient,"Cancers, I think my uncle from my father's side um had uh bladder cancer."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um do you smoke?"
148,RES,patient,I used to smoke. Um I just quit a few years ago.
148,RES,doctor,"OK, congrats. Um how much did you used to smoke?"
148,RES,patient,"Uhm, I don't know, probably I went through a like a whole pack every day, I would say for at least 30 years of my life."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK um so it's good that you stopped. Um do you take any other recreational drugs?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
148,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink?"
148,RES,patient,"Uh I drink every like, maybe a beer a day."
148,RES,doctor,OK. Um are you um living with anyone right now?
148,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's just uh me and my wife."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, where do you guys live?"
148,RES,patient,Uh we just live uh outside of the city in in a condominium.
148,RES,doctor,"OK, any uh old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos, anything like that in the condo?"
148,RES,patient,"No, it's pretty well maintained."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, good. And have you been in contact with any anyone sick recently?"
148,RES,patient,"No, I've mainly just been trying to stay inside. I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province?"
148,RES,patient,"Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least."
148,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?"
148,RES,patient,"Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be."
148,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?"
148,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
148,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test."
148,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
148,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no problem."
149,RES,doctor,How can I help you?
149,RES,patient,"Hi so I brought my 6 year old son in today because yesterday during soccer practice, he he developed this pretty severe cough and he couldn't catch his breath."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, so this happened yesterday, you mentioned?"
149,RES,patient,"Yeah, it happened yesterday afternoon."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm so you mentioned a cough. Is it a harsh barky cough, or is it more like a muffled cough?"
149,RES,patient,I would say it's more muffled.
149,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it a dry cough or is it bringing up any phlegm?"
149,RES,patient,Dry
149,RES,doctor,Dry OK. So no blood in the with the coughing?
149,RES,patient,No blood.
149,RES,doctor,And does he sound wheezy to you?
149,RES,patient,"He does, yeah, he's still sounding a little bit wheezy now. It's it's better than last night. He was a bit more wheezy last night."
149,RES,doctor,OK. Uhm how about shorter breath? Does he sound short of breath at all?
149,RES,patient,"No, that that's gotten a bit better, that resolved about an hour. Like after he stopped playing but he was, he was short of breath yesterday."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you tried anything for his cough, for his shortness of breath or wheezing?"
149,RES,patient,"No, we haven't"
149,RES,doctor,No OK. Does he have a fever at all?
149,RES,patient,"No, he doesn't mention anything about feeling hot or or or having chills either."
149,RES,doctor,"No OK, and any rashes that you've noticed?"
149,RES,patient,No
149,RES,doctor,"No, weight loss over the past few weeks?"
149,RES,patient,"No, he's been gaining weight well."
149,RES,doctor,"OK good, has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"
149,RES,patient,"Well, sometimes he will get a runny nose. He takes like Reactin or Claritin or some sort of allergy pill for that sometimes, but that's usually like the changing of seasons that will happen more often."
149,RES,doctor,OK OK. Does he have any allergies?
149,RES,patient,"Yeah, to mostly environmental triggers. I'm not sure if the specific things are, but I just know it gets worse. Maybe in the spring, springtime?"
149,RES,doctor,OK. And does he have asthma?
149,RES,patient,"He's never been diagnosed, but he has had uhm or his sister has asthma."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And has he? Have you noticed any changes in his vision or hearing?"
149,RES,patient,No.
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about change in his smell or taste?"
149,RES,patient,No
149,RES,doctor,"No, how about like does he seem like he has any chest pain?"
149,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't mentioned anything like that."
149,RES,doctor,Any dizziness or fainting spells?
149,RES,patient,No
149,RES,doctor,"No, confusion or memory loss?"
149,RES,patient,No.
149,RES,doctor,"OK, Uhm how about confusion or sorry you said no headaches?"
149,RES,patient,No headaches.
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK, any joint pains, muscle aches?"
149,RES,patient,No.
149,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about changes to his bowel movements?"
149,RES,patient,"No, everything's been normal there."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, how about nausea or vomiting?"
149,RES,patient,Nothing like that.
149,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, so you mentioned he has asthma. He might have asthma. He was never formally diagnosed. Does is he otherwise healthy or does he have any longstanding medical conditions?"
149,RES,patient,"He's been healthy. Yeah, I know he did have like he would get some itchy skin when he was a bit when he was like a baby, but he hasn't needed any creams for that for a long time."
149,RES,doctor,"OK so he might have something like eczema, you think?"
149,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah I think he did."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and is he on any medications right now?"
149,RES,patient,"No, he doesn't take anything right now."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, Uhm during his mom's pregnancy with him, were there any complications?"
149,RES,patient,"No, she was uhm healthy and he was born at term with a normal weight and able to go home relatively quickly, so there weren't any concerns."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good and was he healthy like after birth?"
149,RES,patient,"Yeah, so he's he's done well. There weren't really any concerns with development or or growth, and he's doing well in school."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good. How about uhm so was he a full term baby and was it a vaginal delivery?"
149,RES,patient,Yes. Yes for both
149,RES,doctor,"OK, any complications during the delivery?"
149,RES,patient,"No,"
149,RES,doctor,"OK, and he didn't need any hospitalizations like right after birth as an as a newborn?"
149,RES,patient,No
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK good. Uhm Is he up to date with all his immunizations?"
149,RES,patient,"He is, yeah"
149,RES,doctor,OK. And you mentioned that he may have some seasonal allergies. Any other allergies that you know of?
149,RES,patient,Not that I know of.
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK. You mentioned that his sister has asthma. Any other lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?"
149,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK. OK. Uhm and does anyone at home smoke?"
149,RES,patient,No
149,RES,doctor,"No OK. Any old carpets? Does mold, asbestos, anything like that at home?"
149,RES,patient,"We we took out the carpets and stuff when his sister was diagnosed with asthma, so it's good from that perspective."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, good, and who lives at home with him?"
149,RES,patient,"So it's myself, his mom and then his sister."
149,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, any pets at home?"
149,RES,patient,He's got a fish.
149,RES,doctor,"A fish, OK. And has he has come into contact with anyone sick recently?"
149,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. I mean when at school, they've been pretty diligent with I mean covid and everything right now, so I think he's been OK."
149,RES,doctor,"Ok, uhm has he traveled anywhere recently?"
149,RES,patient,No.
149,RES,doctor,"No, OK. OK, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
149,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was just wondering if if my son had asthma as well and if like you need a prescription for inhalers."
149,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?"
149,RES,patient,"That sounds good, thank you."
149,RES,doctor,"Alright great, thank you."
150,RES,doctor,What brought you in today?
150,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've just been feeling a bit off over the last week. First I started having like, just a scratchy throat and that was probably I think 5 days ago that happened and then over the last 3 days I've been having diarrhea and also my whole body is just hurting."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, and so, when did the sore throat start?"
150,RES,patient,"I'd say like 5 days ago it started and it first began like kind of a tickle, but now it's more like, even swallowing food hurts a lot."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been eating or drinking less than usual?"
150,RES,patient,"Uhm, yeah my appetite's been a bit less over the last few days just because of how much it hurts."

150,RES,doctor,"OK, and muscle aches, like, when did those start?"
150,RES,patient,"Yeah, so that started just 3 days ago. I remember waking up and my thighs were hurting, then my upper arms and then it kind of went into my upper back and now it's kind of just general pain in all of the muscles."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, are you having any muscle weakness?"
150,RES,patient,"Uhm, I would say it's mainly pain, I don't really feel weakness."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, and how has your energy been? Have you been having fatigue?"
150,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say, uh, I don't know if it's because of the pain, but I definitely feel a lot more tired."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned diarrhea as well. When did that start?"
150,RES,patient,"Yeah, diarrhea also started around 3 days ago. I normally go 1 or 2 times a day, but now I'm going like 6 or 7 times a day and it's all usually pretty watery."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any blood in the stool?"
150,RES,patient,"No, I don't think I noticed blood."

150,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's good. Yeah, it's important to be socially distancing, especially when having symptoms. Has anybody else in that house been sick?"
150,RES,patient,"No, no one has been sick recently, at least in my house, but uh, just two weeks ago I did attend a family event, and just last week I found out, uhm, someone was having symptoms. They just got tested two days ago and their test result hasn't come back."
150,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. And have you traveled anywhere outside of the province or outside of the country?"

150,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, and so, he hasn't needed surgery for it?"
150,RES,patient,No?
150,RES,doctor,"OK, and I think that's all the questions that I wanted to ask today. Was there anything else that that maybe I forgot to tell you or forgot to ask about?"
150,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was just wondering, I don't know the results of the contact that I had, uh, so should I also get tested today?"
150,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in."
150,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good, thank you so much."
151,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
151,RES,patient,"So I've had a fever that I measured this morning and I had a cough.  I've had a cough these last several days. Yeah, today is Friday so it started Monday, so I guess like yeah the cough started four days ago."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, and the fever started four days ago as well?"
151,RES,patient,"Well, I've been feeling hot this week, but I checked my temperature this morning and it was the first time I checked it and it was 38.5."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, so that's definitely a fever, so we can take your temperature today as well. Umm, so have your symptoms been the same or getting worse, or be getting better over the past few days?"
151,RES,patient,"They are getting worse. I've been starting to feel really fatigued and, uh, tired as well and the cough has gotten worse too."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, have you ever felt like this before?"
151,RES,patient,"I mean, maybe a really long time ago when I was a kid or something like that. Maybe I had the flu, but nothing recently."

151,RES,patient,"Umm, no, I can't think of anything."

151,RES,doctor,"OK, and any triggers for your nausea?"
151,RES,patient,"Oh I can't think of anything. It just sort of came on. And it really went away on its own pretty quickly, but uh I don't know, maybe it was when I had my headache."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, when when did your headache start?"
151,RES,patient,"Um, so it's been on and off these last several days so I've been kind of resting a bit more too."
151,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, you said past several days, have you ever had headaches before that?"

151,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. Do you feel fatigued or tired at all?"
151,RES,patient,"Yeah, for sure. I haven't really had any changes, but just haven't been really getting my work done throughout the day because I have just been feeling so tired."
151,RES,doctor,"Yeah, umm, and do you feel any sort of body aches that go along with your fatigue?"
151,RES,patient,Maybe a little.
151,RES,doctor,"OK. Umm, can you think of anything that may have caused your symptoms? You know, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"

151,RES,patient,"Well, I have been walking the dog more. he weather is getting better and trying to eat out less often. Yeah, I've been trying to lose weight, but it it's been yeah, relatively stable still."

151,RES,patient,"I think my grandfather had bladder cancer, but, uh, I'm not sure."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, and I forget if I asked you earlier, but have you had any changes to your urinary habits, any changes in your urine itself or voiding frequency?"
151,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any changes there and I haven't noticed any like blood or color changes. No pain."

151,RES,doctor,"OK, and where do you live?"
151,RES,patient,I live in a like duplex and rent the basement in a house nearby.
151,RES,doctor,"OK, do you live with anyone?"
151,RES,patient,"Yeah, I live with my girlfriend."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, any concerns for you know old carpets or mold or asbestos in the duplex that you're living in?"
151,RES,patient,"Not in our unit so I mean, maybe upstairs, but if it's anything like our place, then no."
151,RES,doctor,OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?
151,RES,patient,"Uh, no, well  I guess I was just concerned about about COVID."
151,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you know that's the top on my list of differential diagnosis for you. So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics."
151,RES,patient,"OK yeah, thank you for all that information. Sounds great."
151,RES,doctor,"OK, well take care then, alright."
151,RES,patient,Thank you.
152,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
152,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?"
152,RES,patient,"The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago."
152,RES,doctor,"10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?"
152,RES,patient,That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.
152,RES,doctor,"OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start?"
152,RES,patient,"Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea."
152,RES,doctor,"OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?"
152,RES,patient,"Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?"
152,RES,patient,"Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything."
152,RES,doctor,"OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?"
152,RES,patient,"Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely."
152,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?"
152,RES,patient,"No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?"
152,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating."
152,RES,doctor,"Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?"
152,RES,patient,"Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else."
152,RES,doctor,"OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?"
152,RES,patient,"Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just"
152,RES,doctor,"Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?"

152,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."

152,RES,patient,"OK, any fevers or chills?"
152,RES,doctor,"Uh no I, maybe like a few chills, like I'm not sure actually, it was hard to tell, but I haven't had any fevers."
152,RES,patient,"OK, we'll take your temperature today just to make sure. Um any weight loss over the past few weeks?"
152,RES,doctor,"Uh no, probably weight gain."

152,RES,doctor,"Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?"
152,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
152,RES,patient,"I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing."

152,RES,doctor,OK. Um and where do you live right now?
152,RES,patient,"Uh, so yeah, I just live in the city in London uh in an apartment with my, just wife, my wife."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, um is she also sick or is she OK?"
152,RES,patient,"No, she's been completely fine, and I've been kind of isolating myself from her over the last week."
152,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?"
152,RES,patient,Mhmm.
152,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?"
152,RES,patient,"Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this"
152,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
152,RES,patient,"No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere."
152,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?"
152,RES,patient,"Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it."
152,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?"
152,RES,patient,"My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?"
152,RES,doctor,"Yes, please do."
152,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
152,RES,doctor,"Alright, take care."
152,RES,patient,"You too, thank you."
153,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, nice to meet you I, I've been having just over the last week my cough that's been getting worse and I had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday I noticed that I started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, so yeah, let's rewind a little bit. The cough you said started a couple of weeks ago, so would that be about 2 weeks? Three weeks?"
153,RES,patient,"I would say last week, so like 7 seven days ago."
153,RES,doctor,"Seven days ago, OK. So that started seven days ago and then when did the fever start?"
153,RES,patient,"The fever I hasn't been constant, but I've like had some nights where I just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills I've been recorded at a temperature, but I think I've had a fever at least three times in the last week."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?"
153,RES,patient,Yeah.
153,RES,doctor,"OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?"
153,RES,patient,"I think the taste happened like before, but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast, I couldn't really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner, but smell, I kind of lost around the evening."
153,RES,doctor,OK.
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, all just started yesterday."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?"
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's been pretty constant. It's been getting worse, especially like in the last few days. I'm mainly coughing like before I was coughing mainly at night, but now I'm coughing throughout the day."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?"
153,RES,patient,"Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh? Barky?"
153,RES,patient,"Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?
153,RES,patient,"Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?"
153,RES,patient,"Um, not really, no."
153,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about we wheeziness?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,Chest pain?
153,RES,patient,No chest pain.
153,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, experienced any weight loss recently?"
153,RES,patient,"No, not that I know."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, how about fatigue?"
153,RES,patient,"I have been a bit tired in the last few days. The fevers at night and morning. Just feeling a little bit crummy, just not really energetic, energetic to do anything."
153,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure."
153,RES,patient,"Just been planner, just sitting on the couch."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. Any changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes?"
153,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, you mentioned loss of smell. Do you have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
153,RES,patient,"I did have a runny nose earlier this week, but that's kind of subsided. Other than that, I don't really feel too much congestion. I've been taking Tylenol, the Tylenol cold so I don't know if that helped."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, how often are you taking the Tylenol cold?"
153,RES,patient,I just took it like for four days just before going to sleep in the last week.
153,RES,doctor,"Oh, I see. OK. OK and then. Any I do have a sore throat?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,"No, ok. How about any changes to your vision or hearing?"

153,RES,doctor,"No, no blood in the stool, right?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes to your appetite?"
153,RES,patient,"Um, just maybe in like a little bit with the loss of smell and taste, the food is not really the same in the last day, last few days?"
153,RES,doctor,"Yeah yeah, that makes sense. Any nausea or vomiting?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And any changes in terms of urine?"
153,RES,patient,"No, I've been peeing alright."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Any major or a longstanding medical conditions, or are you otherwise healthy?"
153,RES,patient,"No, I've been fortunate otherwise healthy. I had asthma as a kid, but like I haven't had to use the puffers for more than a decade."
153,RES,doctor,Oh ok. OK. And what triggers your asthma?
153,RES,patient,I think back then it was just when I did sports and I was running around a lot. I've been fine for the last 10 years at least.
153,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, that's good. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?"
153,RES,patient,No.
153,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Any are you on any medications?"
153,RES,patient,"Currently just the other thing, Tylenol cold, but other than that no other medications."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, not even other over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"
153,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
153,RES,doctor,OK. Do you have any allergies?
153,RES,patient,"Um, sometimes in the fall like I get a bit sniffly and, but other than that, I don't know of any allergies to any foods or medications."
153,RES,doctor,OK. And how about immunizations? Are you up to date?
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, they're all up to date."
153,RES,doctor,Any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?
153,RES,patient,"Uh, my father did recently have a heart attack at age of 58 I think he was, he, he's fine though, but that's that's about it."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, um any cancers that run in the family?"
153,RES,patient,"Um, no, I don't think so."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. And, and do you smoke?"
153,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, yeah I do."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, how much do you smoke?"
153,RES,patient,"Probably, I would say a pack a day."
153,RES,doctor,"Pack a day, OK. For how long?"
153,RES,patient,"Ah, probably since in my 20s, so at least 10 years now."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?"
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, especially with this pandemic going on, it's been, I've been trying to cut down just because like I don't want to get the, get COVID and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking. So I've been trying to cut down."
153,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure it's good that you're trying to cut down. We have resources to help you if you ever need them."
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, for sure."
153,RES,doctor,Do you do marijuana?
153,RES,patient,"No, no, I've never tried marijuana."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, how about other recreational drugs?"
153,RES,patient,"No, um, besides alcohol, nothing else."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?"
153,RES,patient,"Um, um, not that much. I'd probably say like a few times a week when there's a game on. I just grab a couple of beers, but that's about it."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, and where do you live right now?"
153,RES,patient,"Yes, I just live just outside of London with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse."
153,RES,doctor,OK and anyone else at home sick?
153,RES,patient,"No. I I've kind of stayed away once I noticed some symptoms. I'm just kind of just staying in my room, not getting out. I don't wanna make any of my families like."
153,RES,doctor,"Yeah, that makes sense. And have you traveled to anywhere recently?"
153,RES,patient,"No, umm, I haven't really traveled. I do I do go to work though I haven't in the last last week. I've told them that I've been having these symptoms, but other than that, no traveling."
153,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, OK, that's good. Those were all the questions I had for you today. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?"
153,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID."
153,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?"
153,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. I'll, I'll let my work know and yeah, hopefully it comes back negative, but I'll stay away from everyone till then."
153,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds great, thank you."
153,RES,patient,"Alright, thank you so much."
154,RES,doctor,How are you?
154,RES,patient,"I'm not so good, these last few days I haven't benn able to reallykeep anything down and not feeling so good."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days? 3 days?"
154,RES,patient,"Well, I feel like maybe the last five days I just haven't been feeling so good and I haven't really felt like eating. But these last two days I've been really nauseous and I've thrown up a few times."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy? Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, I do feel hot and um, yeah, maybe a bit tired."
154,RES,doctor,Tired? OK. And nausea and vomiting. Are you throwing up or just feeling nauseous?
154,RES,patient,"Mostly nauseous, but yeah, yesterday I threw up like three or four times and then again today I threw up like two or three times."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, are you throwing up any blood?"
154,RES,patient,"No, I didn't see any red. It was mostly like yellow and umm, liquidy beacuse I haven't been eating much solids or like just like food. I've been mostly just having drinks."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and so mostly fluid you said?"
154,RES,patient,Yeah.
154,RES,doctor,"OK, and what color is it?"
154,RES,patient,"Uhh, yeah, usually usually kind of like yellowish clear."
154,RES,doctor,OK. Are you having any abdominal pain?
154,RES,patient,"Maybe like after I vomit it kind of feels like squeezing a little bit. But I think, yeah, I think yeah that's just really just with when I'm heaving."
154,RES,doctor,"Right, um, are you, do you have any changes in your bowel movements?"
154,RES,patient,"Umm, no, I haven't noticed anything there."
154,RES,doctor,"OK. And so no diarrhea, no constipation?"
154,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, no blood in your stool?"
154,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about issues swallowing food?"
154,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, no problem swallowing. Just haven't felt hungry."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, so you don't have much of an appetite then."
154,RES,patient,"No, not not really."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, so um, any changes in in taste?"
154,RES,patient,"Um, maybe I mean, yeah, I think I might not be really tasting things the same."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, how about smell?"
154,RES,patient,"Now that you say it, I might, uh, yeah I think my smell has been impacted as well. I can't really smell anything."
154,RES,doctor,OK.
154,RES,patient,"I thought that was kind of weird, but didn't think anything of it actually until you just asked me."
154,RES,doctor,Yeah for sure. And how about any changes in your vision or hearing?
154,RES,patient,No changes to vision or hearing.
154,RES,doctor,"OK, any discharge?"
154,RES,patient,"Uh, nothing like that that, but I mean my eyes were a bit, they've been a bit red these last two days."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, have they been in any pain?"
154,RES,patient,"Nope, no pain and I've been able to see everything OK. It's just I just noticed they were a little bit more red. I just thought maybe I don't know I was, I've just been tired."
154,RES,doctor,Yeah for sure. Any coughing?
154,RES,patient,"Uhh, yeah I haven't had a cough but um, I've had a cough for a few years now, so yeah, that's not really a change for me."
154,RES,doctor,"Alright, so no change in your cough. Is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
154,RES,patient,"It's uh, oh, a dry cough usually."
154,RES,doctor,"Dry cough, OK. Any blood that you produce?"
154,RES,patient,"No blood, no blood."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, any shortness of breath?"
154,RES,patient,I'm not really able to exercise and stuff like that.
154,RES,doctor,"OK, have any wheeziness?"
154,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any fatigue or tiredness?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've definitely felt a little bit more kind of groggy and tired this last week, really."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, and muscle aches to go along with that?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, bit in my like kind of upper arms and legs a little bit."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, you said you've been feeling groggy. Do you feel dizzy at all?"
154,RES,patient,"Not dizzy, just maybe that I'm like moving in slow motion."
154,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, any confusion or memory loss?"
154,RES,patient,"No, I think I've been OK."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, any rashes?"
154,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed any rashes."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, how about headaches?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, these last few days I've had a bit of a headache as well.It hasn't been very intense, so, um, I'm not worried about it too much."
154,RES,doctor,"Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing."
154,RES,doctor,"Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?"
154,RES,patient,"No, no, it's pretty similar to headaches that I've had before."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, well I have high blood pressure and also, high cholesterol, so I do take medications for both of those. So yeah, I take a statin and Amlodipine I think."
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter."
154,RES,doctor,"Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?"
154,RES,patient,"No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats. But I mean now that you asked if I felt more hot than than usual, maybe."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, and did you take your temperature?"
154,RES,patient,"Uh, I did and the last time I checked it was a few days ago and at that time I didn't have a fever, but I mean, I'm still feeling hot so I'm not sure."
154,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?"
154,RES,patient,"Um, no. Like the last time I was in the hospital with, it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
154,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, actually got the shingles vaccine a few months ago."
154,RES,doctor,OK.
154,RES,patient,"Probably closer to a year ago now, actually."
154,RES,doctor,"Oh great, OK, that's awesome and are you allergic to anything?"
154,RES,patient,Just peanuts.
154,RES,doctor,"Peanuts, OK. Do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, my son has asthma. But nobody in my family's had a heart problem, though."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?"
154,RES,patient,"No, just my dad had colon cancer."
154,RES,doctor,OK. And do you smoke at all?
154,RES,patient,"No, I don't."
154,RES,patient,"Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, how about other recreational drugs?"
154,RES,patient,"I mean, I briefly like dabbled in the past at parties and stuff like that but that was when I was way younger, like in in my college years."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, what kind of drugs?"
154,RES,patient,"I think maybe we used cocaine a few times and MDMA, uh, but that was like a long time, probably like 30 years ago."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, were any of these drugs injected IV?"
154,RES,patient,"No, no, I've never done that."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, that's good. Do you drink alcohol?"
154,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. What kind of drinks do you have and how much of it do you have?"
154,RES,patient,"Usually, it'll just be one or two glasses of wine at a time and maybe two nights a week."
154,RES,doctor,OK.
154,RES,patient,And I usually stick with red wine.
154,RES,doctor,"OK, great, and who do you live with?"
154,RES,patient,"So um, it's just me and my son."
154,RES,doctor,How old is your son?
154,RES,patient,"Uh, he's 18."
154,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you live in a house or an apartment?"
154,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, we live in an apartment. Yeah, on the 8th floor."
154,RES,doctor,"On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?"
154,RES,patient,"It's a newish building so there isn't really any carpet actually in the unit, so yeah, it's pretty clean that way."
154,RES,doctor,OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?
154,RES,patient,"Well, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better."
154,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?"
154,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you."
154,RES,doctor,"Alright, great."
155,RES,doctor,What brought you in today?
155,RES,patient,"Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. When did the chest pain start?"
155,RES,patient,"So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of?"
155,RES,patient,"No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain. It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away?"
155,RES,patient,"Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better?"
155,RES,patient,"Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down?"
155,RES,patient,"Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on?"
155,RES,patient,"Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow."
155,RES,doctor,"I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before?"
155,RES,patient,"No, never."
155,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches?"

155,RES,patient,Not that I know of.
155,RES,doctor,"OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there."
155,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all?"
155,RES,doctor,"I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened."
155,RES,patient,"OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much."

156,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
156,RES,patient,"Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?"
156,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?"
156,RES,patient,That sounds really good. Thank you.
156,RES,doctor,"OK, no worries. Take care."
157,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
157,RES,patient,"Hi, so yeah I I'm really worried. I started coughing up blood this morning, and for the last two days I've been having some, like on my right calf, just a lot of swelling and tenderness. Uhm, I just actually got out of the hospital just last week. I had a knee replacement surgery on my right leg. So yeah, I was just really concerned about this blood that I'm coughing up."
157,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly. So when, so you had a knee surgery last week, were you like immobilized afterwards for periods of time?"
157,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any pain in your calf, and if so, which which one?"
157,RES,patient,It's just the right calf and it's it's pretty swollen right now and I was having a lot of pain over it for the last two days.
157,RES,doctor,"OK is it, can you feel the pain at rest, or or is it with uh like with movement? Or if you press on it?"
157,RES,patient,"It's yeah, it's pretty tender when I press on it. I haven't really been moving around, and it's still like painful right now, but it doesn't really hurt when I'm like, like I've been trying to keep myself rested just because of the surgery, but when I press on it, it is pretty tender."
157,RES,doctor,"OK, and is the is the swelling in kind of one spot of your leg, or is it most of the of the leg?"
157,RES,patient,"It's just the calf, I would say more like just the lower leg area."
157,RES,doctor,"OK. Have you noticed any skin changes, like redness or or or temperature like it feels hot to touch."
157,RES,patient,Maybe a little bit. I haven't really noticed it too much.

157,RES,doctor,"OK, and how much blood are you coughing up?"
157,RES,patient,"Just some on like I just notice on the tissue like just some spots that I noticed every time that I'm, like, I would have to cough it up. Maybe like in the last couple hours, I've had three episodes of that where I've noticed blood on the tissue."

157,RES,patient,"No, I think that's that's all."
157,RES,doctor,"OK, so we'll get the lab work started, as well as the imaging ordered. It will look for, to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present, because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time, it is a risk factor for it, and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this. So we'll wanna make sure to to do, to investigate for a pulmonary embolism."

158,CAR,doctor,"OK, so based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down and your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you are on as well as your history, that you might be having what's called congestive heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body, which may be caused by heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there."

160,RES,patient,"Um not uh, I don't think so like we um, maybe in the Philippines, we do provide a, so I go on like these mission trips with the Church and um we do sometimes go to the hospital as well."
160,RES,doctor,OK.
160,RES,patient,"Sometimes yeah, we we do see some sick people."
160,RES,doctor,"Mhmm, OK."
160,RES,patient,"But other than that, not since I've been here, no."
160,RES,doctor,Any travel outside the Philippines recently?
160,RES,patient,"Uhm, so I think. So this year has just been the Philippines, before I used to go to India as well. Um but recently nothing outside of the Philippines."
160,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, um those were all the questions that I had for you. Do you have any questions for me?"
160,RES,patient,"Yeah, I I was very worried um uh about the blood. I was just reading some things up and uh, about tuberculosis, so I was really stressed out today."
160,RES,doctor,"Yeah so um, that's definitely high on our differential. So, we'll do a couple of things. We'll do a Covid swab on you um just to rule that in or out, you should hear back for, about those results, in 24 to 48 hours. While you're here in the hospital, we're also going to do a chest X-Ray and or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent TB. If those come back positive um we will require you to isolate because this uh, because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. Um so we have a couple of uh, we have like a regimen that we'd put you on. It's called the RIPE medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. Um but we will uh keep you here until we have more answers on um like from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?"
160,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Um yeah I'm really worried, but hopefully it's not TB."
160,RES,doctor,"Yeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved. Uh we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment."
160,RES,patient,"OK, thank you so much."
160,RES,doctor,"Yeah, no problem."

161,RES,patient,Yeah yeah.
161,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and so most likely it's just caused by a viral infection like common cold perhaps, it she doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now, so and no signs of like a bacterial infection that I would be concerned about that I would give antibiotics for right now. But definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath, increased coughing with producing, more yellow or green material and if she gets more feverish, so will also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well. But yeah, some of these things you just look out for, but yeah, so that that we'll do the physical examination and go from there."

162,RES,doctor,"No OK, alright so I think that's all the questions I had right now. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
162,RES,patient,"No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her?"
162,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
162,RES,patient,"Uh no, that sounds great, thank you."
162,RES,doctor,"You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there."
162,RES,patient,"OK, sounds great thanks."
162,RES,doctor,You're welcome.  Take care.
162,RES,patient,You too.
163,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
163,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I've been feeling just really down recently in the last week. I started off by having this sore throat which started around 5 days ago and then I also noticed I've been getting some chills over the last few day. And on top of all of that, within the last three to four days I've been getting muscle aches all over my body."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?"
163,RES,patient,"So the fever. I think I haven't measured it, but I started having chills like 3 days ago."
163,RES,doctor,"Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?"
163,RES,patient,I would say 3 days ago as well.
163,RES,doctor,"Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?"
163,RES,patient,"A little bit with solids with a sore throat but liquids, I'm doing OK right now."
163,RES,doctor,"OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?"
163,RES,patient,"No, I think my voice has been the same. It's just when I'm not talking, especially if I'm swallowing my own like spit, it still hurts sometimes, but mainly with solid food."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and then, are you having any issues with taste or smell?"
163,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, how about hearing or vision?"
163,RES,patient,"No, no changes."
163,RES,doctor,Any weight loss over the past few weeks?
163,RES,patient,"No, I probably have gained weight."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, any fatigue or exhaustion?"
163,RES,patient,"Now that you mention it, I do feel pretty tired over the last few days, I don't know if it's just because of my muscles aching all the time, or I don't know. I have definitely felt very tired."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, how about changes in your hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
163,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."

163,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain? You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?"
163,RES,patient,"Um, no, I don't think it's specifically my joints. I think more so I would say like around in my thighs. Then I would say just my upper arms hurt a lot. And even, uh, my upper back area hurts a lot as well, so it's kind of just everywhere. But those are some areas that hurt the most."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, are you otherwise healthy?"
163,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, I do have a couple of things on my list. I do have high blood pressure. I have diabetes and other than that, I also have like high cholesterol."
163,RES,doctor,OK.
163,RES,patient,"Yeah, that's just some of the things that I've been diagnosed with."
163,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, and do you take medication for any of these things?"
163,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I take for the blood pressure, I take this medication called the Ramipril."
163,RES,doctor,OK yeah.
163,RES,patient,"And then for diabetes I'm taking Metformin. And then for the cholesterol I'm taking this medication called Crestor, yeah. Yeah, but other than that, just like vitamin D and multi vitamins. Those are some of the medications that I'm taking."

163,RES,doctor,"OK, good. And and how about any allergies?"
163,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't have any allergies."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
163,RES,patient,"Uhm, no lung conditions and uhh heart conditions, both my mom and dad suffered from like high blood pressure. My dad also had a heart attack when in his 60s. Now there is some heart conditions that run in the family."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?"
163,RES,patient,"Uhm, m son actually got diagnosed with colorectal cancer just a few years ago."
163,RES,doctor,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
163,RES,patient,He's doing OK though. Like it was pretty scary at the time.
163,RES,doctor,How old was he when he was diagnosed?
163,RES,patient,"I think he was, yeah in his forties, 46."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?"
163,RES,patient,"Yeah I had it done. Everything came back normal so yeah, I'm not sure where he got it from."
163,RES,doctor,OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?
163,RES,patient,"No, no sick contacts that I know of. I've been mainly in my house. I do go outside for groceries and some things like that, but other than that I'm retired. I don't really go out too much."
163,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, and you said you're retired. Do you live alone? Do you live with anyone?"
163,RES,patient,"No, yeah, I live alone now. And I live in London in an apartment"
163,RES,doctor,"OK, any old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos?"
163,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that. It's a pretty safe building."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, good, and do you smoke?"
163,RES,patient,"I used to. I used to smoke, probably in my 20s to late 40s, but then I quit."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, good, good for you. How much did you smoke before you quit?"
163,RES,patient,"Probably one to two packs a day, I would say."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good, that's good that you quit. Do you drink any alcohol?"
163,RES,patient,"Uhm, I just stick to some red wine, maybe a couple times a week."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, couple times a week so two to three times?"
163,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say two to three times and, uh, I probably go through maybe 1 bottle every two weeks."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And then any marijuana?"
163,RES,patient,"No, no, I've never had any marijuana or any recreational drugs, no, nothing else."
163,RES,doctor,"OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
163,RES,patient,"Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about."
163,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"
163,RES,patient,"Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?"
163,RES,doctor,"Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year."
163,RES,patient,"OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on."
163,RES,doctor,"Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider."
163,RES,patient,"OK, alright sounds good."
163,RES,doctor,"Alright, take care."

164,RES,doctor,"OK, and the cough, can you describe it a little bit? Is it like a wet cough, a dry cough? How would you describe it?"
164,RES,patient,"Yeah, I brought up a little bit of sputum. It's been clear, mostly clear and sometimes dry as well. The cough's been getting worse over the last couple of days as well and hasn't really stopped either, it's just kind of ongoing all day."
164,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's it's pretty constant?"
164,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's been constant."
164,RES,doctor,"OK, and how much sputum would you say you're bringing up?"

164,RES,doctor,"OK, and is your sputum at all yellow, green? Or does it have any blood tinge content in it?"
164,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."

164,RES,doctor,"OK, When do you have the chest tightness, when did that start?"
164,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah, that's started within the last two days as well, with the cough."
164,RES,doctor,"OK, so is it just the tightness when you cough or is it there just throughout?"
164,RES,patient,"Yeah if I take like a deep breath in, like, it just feels tight, like I can't get a deep breath."

164,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?"
164,RES,patient,"Yeah, if I exert myself it does make it a bit worse. It'll bring on the cough more, and shortness of breath."
164,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about any positional changes? Like, does lying down help? Does resting help relieve some of that tightness, cough and shortness of breath?"
164,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that has helped."
164,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you tried any kind of medications at all, over the counter?"
164,RES,patient,"No, I haven't tried anything."
164,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, so it seems that your shortness of breath, is it, uh, mainly when you're breathing in or breathing out? Or are you having shallow breaths? How would you describe it?"
164,RES,patient,"I would say it, yeah, I kind of go back to the chest tightness, it just feels like I'm not able to, like, breath in all the way and catch my breath after I exert myself or coughing. It's easy Uh, like if I rest I'm not short of breath."

We definitely want to make sure that you don't have coronavirus, so we will do a test for you today. And what we recommend in the meantime is to self isolate, even in your home, wear a mask around your family, if you can, like, eat separately, don't go outside and be off of work until the test results come back and then even after that, you might need to follow instructions of public health and self isolate for 14 days. If not coronavirus, hopefully, then it can also be other things, like, other viruses can cause similar symptoms as well, but yeah. So, we'll just get that test done and then see where to go from there."

It seems that your symptoms, You do have that cough and the shortness of breath and it's been chronic, but now you're coughing up some blood as well, so that is definitely something that's concerning and we want to make sure there is nothing going on so we will get a chest X-ray for you and see if we can find anything there. Are still producing the bloody sputum?"
165,RES,patient,"Yeah, that's been coming up a daily still."
165,RES,doctor,"OK, so if you think you can produce that, we can even take a sample of that as well and see if there is any presence. The one thing that we are concerned about with some of your symptoms and a long history of smoking as well is lung cancer. So yeah, we will do a chest X-ray, get some cytology done as well and then once we have that in the future we may need to maybe do a biopsy but right now we'll do a few of the first things that I mentioned and then go from there."

166,RES,doctor,"Your smell has been kind of funny, like you can't smell or do things smell differently than you expect them to?"
166,RES,patient,"Yeah, there was a candle on earlier today and I guess I couldn't really smell it, so I guess I haven't been able to smell."
166,RES,doctor,"Ok, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose?"
166,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had to blow my nose or anything."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?"

166,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have atrial fibrillation. And I do take Metoprolol for that."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, how long have you had A. fib?"
166,RES,patient,"It was like 4 years ago I think it was. It was having that like, felt like my heart was racing you were asking about earlier and they did an ECG and I was told I had atrial fibrillation. So yeah, I've been on a beta blocker for three years now."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, four years, and when was the last time you had an ECG?"
166,RES,patient,"Uh, maybe just a couple of months ago. I think every time that I come in to see my family doctor, they they do one."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and the last time that it was done, was it normal?"
166,RES,doctor,"OK, good. And then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"

166,RES,doctor,"OK, any complications from that?"
166,RES,patient,Um no.
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and then besides the Metoprolol, are you on any other medications?"
166,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I take a statin and baby aspirin."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and is that for the A. fib as well, the aspirin? Or is that just for other cardiovascular issues or some sort of preventative measure?"
166,RES,patient,"Yeah, I heard it was good for people who have atrial fibrillation so I started taking it."
166,RES,doctor,OK. and let's revisit your medications at the end of today's session. I just want to make sure that you're on the medications and I just want to make sure you're on the right dose.  Does that sound good?
166,RES,patient,"Yeah, certainly."
166,RES,patient,I think it's like a sulfa allergy. I received an antibiotic like that many years ago and had a rash.
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and have you had any reason to suspect that you may have taken any sulfas recently?"
166,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had any antibiotics so no, really no changes."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
166,RES,patient,I am yeah. I've received the Zoster vaccine for shingles and also the one for pneumonia.
166,RES,doctor,"OK, good, good yeah, those two we definitely recommend if you're over 65. OK, and do you know of any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"
166,RES,patient,"No, I think my aunt had lung cancer but she smoked her entire life."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and how about other cancers?"
166,RES,patient,No other cancers.
166,RES,doctor,And have you been in touch or do you think you've been in contact with any anyone sick recently?
166,RES,patient,"Well, I visited my mother at a long term care facility just this past weekend, so I guess about just over a week ago I visited there."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and have there been any COVID outbreaks at the long term care?"
166,RES,patient,"Yeah, there has been, I thought I was like away from those areas but I have heard about outbreaks there."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and any travel history?"
166,RES,patient,No travel.
166,RES,doctor,And do you smoke?
166,RES,patient,"I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, but I quit about, uh, about five years ago. I know four years ago it was when I found out I had atrial fibrillation. I quit."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, well that's good. Good for you for quitting. How about marijuana?"
166,RES,patient,"No, I don't smoke it, but I'll use some edibles I buy from the Ontario stores a couple of times per week. Just the CBD stuff."
166,RES,doctor,The CBD stuff OK. And how many milligrams?
166,RES,patient,"I'm not sure, I know it's their lowest dose though."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, OK if it's lowest dose, it might be 2.5 milligrams."
166,RES,patient,Sounds familiar.
166,RES,doctor,OK good. Is there a particular reason you take these CBD edibles?
166,RES,patient,It helps me sleep.
166,RES,doctor,"OK, if it's specifically to help you sleep, we can actually try and see if there are other options for you. You know there are pills, like they are sleep aids. Or even things like melatonin that can help regulate your sleep so we can revisit other options for you if you're open to that as well."
166,RES,patient,"OK for sure. Yeah I will. Um, yeah we can talk about that later."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, that sounds good and do you do any other recreational drugs?"
166,RES,patient,I do not.
166,RES,doctor,"OK, how about alcohol?"
166,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't drink anymore."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and did you used to drink before?"
166,RES,patient,"Yes, I just stopped a few years ago,"
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and what's your living situation like right now?"
166,RES,patient,I live in a house with my wife.
166,RES,doctor,"In a house, OK. Any concerns for like old carpets, mold or asbestos in your house?"
166,RES,patient,"No, we've renovated it over the years."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, good and I apologize, but I would like to clarify three more symptoms with you. Did you say you felt like you had a fever earlier?"
166,RES,patient,"Um, maybe I've been feeling a little hot, but it's been really more the cough and shortness of breath that's been bugging me."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, well we can take a temperature today just to make sure. Have you been feeling like you have night sweats or chills?"
166,RES,patient,"Um, not really. No, I haven't noticed that."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about, um, any weight loss over the past few months?"
166,RES,patient,"No, it's been been stable."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, alright good, so that brings us to the end. Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to clarify before we end the interview?"
166,RES,patient,"No, nothing today.  I was just really hoping to get, uh, whatever this is sorted out."
166,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you know, um, right now it looks like, it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes COVID.  So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do encourage isolation for 14 days. Until your symptoms are gone, sorry,  until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread COVID so we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband. If possible, we will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not COVID, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own, and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics. How does that sound?"
166,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds like a great plan."
166,RES,doctor,"OK, great so um, I will see you at the next appointment."
166,RES,patient,Thank you.
167,RES,doctor,Can you tell me what brought you in here today?
167,RES,patient,"Sure, I've been feeling very short of breath for the past, uh, two weeks, but even before that, I started feeling a little bit short of breath and I can't stop coughing and it just feels like it's really hard for me to breathe."
167,RES,doctor,"OK, so this started two weeks ago?"
167,RES,patient,"Yeah, it started two weeks ago."
167,RES,doctor,"OK, and you're also coughing?"
167,RES,patient,Yeah.

167,RES,patient,"Uhm,  I guess just, yeah, I'm not really too sure, they said I had some heart condition and my heart isn't functioning as well as it should be. They did an echo on me."

167,RES,doctor,"OK, and any recreational drugs like marijuana?"
167,RES,patient,I smoke once in a while.

167,RES,doctor,"Like uh, do you get it from a store that sells the joint?"
167,RES,patient,"Yeah, I get it from like a medical dispensary."
167,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, I see. Yeah, I just want to make sure because some, if you get it from other sources there might be more irritants in there that can cause some of your symptoms and for them to get worse as well. So yeah."
167,RES,patient,"Oh I see, I see, OK."
167,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and other than that, do you have any questions or concerns at all?"
167,RES,patient,"No, what do you think I should do from, For now?"
167,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so right now what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing, shortness of breath, and you have a history of COPD & CHF, we definitely want to make sure that you're not having, uhm, what I think you might be having isn't just an exacerbation of your COPD, and especially with the green sputum it might be like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse, so we'll do all the appropriate testing, we'll do, a chest X-ray, we'll get some blood work done as well, w'ell give you some uh, Ventolin as well while you're here, and we might give you like a steroid medication as well. So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here. So yeah, let's just, I'll get back to you, we'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there. Is that OK?"
167,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
167,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
168,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today.
168,RES,patient,"I I've had this cough that's been ongoing and and getting worse, and and now I've been having this like sharp pain in my in my chest."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the cough first start?"
168,RES,patient,"So yeah, like the cough started, uh, started maybe a couple of weeks ago."
168,RES,doctor,"A couple weeks ago, OK, and has it gotten worse since then, or has it stayed about the same?"
168,RES,patient,"Uh it, it got worse initially, but it's been about the, uh, well, actually yeah, it's been getting worse 'cause now I've I've started to notice blood in the sputum that wasn't there at first."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did you first notice that?"
168,RES,patient,"So I, I first saw some blood, uhm, two days ago. It was a really small amount so I didn't worry too much, but I I brought up blood yesterday and again this morning. It's been just about enough to cover a tissue, so it's not a lot of blood each time, but it's pretty red."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and before that were you getting any production throughout your coughs for the last few weeks, like were you producing any sputum?"
168,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
168,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Can you just describe your cough currently? Is it more of a wet cough or dry cough?"
168,RES,patient,"Uh it, yeah, it's it's dry mostly with the exception of bringing up some of the blood."
168,RES,doctor,"And is the blood just in like sputum that you're bringing up? Or are you coughing up blood into the tissue, for example?"
168,RES,patient,"Blood is, I'm coughing that up into the tissue."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you remember 2 weeks ago prior to that, were there any factors that might have caused this, like for example, did you travel anywhere or see or was in contact with anyone that was sick?"
168,RES,patient,"No I haven't uh, traveled anywhere. I have been doing volunteering and and things at the homeless shelter here in in town. It's been really cold out."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, and how long have you been volunteering there?"
168,RES,patient,"Uh, I started this winter, so the last three, three or four months."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and were you in contact with anyone there that was sick or was having similar symptoms at all?"
168,RES,patient,"There are certainly some people around that that had some that would have a cough, or were not feeling very well but, uh, and sometimes I would see people who would even have a hospital gown on, that that that uh came from the hospital. So yeah, there were definitely some people who weren't feeling well."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you know if anyone at the homeless shelter or anywhere else around your surrounding has had tuberculosis?"
168,RES,patient,"No, not that I'm aware of. I haven't heard of that."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, are you having any other symptoms at all besides the the coughing and the blood, like coughing up blood as well?"
168,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been uh, starting to get like this sharp chest pain as well. I kind of feel it on the left sides and in center I guess kinda more so."
168,RES,doctor,"OK and your chest pain, when did that start?"
168,RES,patient,"So, uh, this started, yeah, 'bout a few days ago as well. It's been within the last week."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, would you describe it as, so you said it's kind of a sharp pain, does it move around anywhere?"
168,RES,patient,"No, the pain I feel it about in the same spot each time."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you feeling the pain when you're coughing or is it when you're exerting yourself, like when do you feel the pain, and how long does it last?"
168,RES,patient,"I, yeah, I will feel it when I cough. I also feel it uh, if I'm maybe moving around as well. Like changing positions or things like that. It hurts for a few minutes and then it it will kind of settle down. If if I'm, if I stay stationary and sort of lean forward a little bit it will it will start to feel better."
168,RES,doctor,"Sort of feels better? OK, and besides, besides like leaning forward, has anything helped reduce that pain at all?"
168,RES,patient,"Yeah, well if I lie flat, uhm it, it's uh, or sorry. No actually, the pain gets worse if I I lie flat or if I'm if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really, the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, I see, and do you have any pain when breathing in or out?"
168,RES,patient,"I do, yeah it it gets worse if I if I'm taking a deep breath in, and even more so after I after I cough, if I'm trying to catch my breath, I'll feel it then too."

168,RES,patient,"My dad had a stroke when he was in his late 60s, but that's the only thing I can think of."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and I know you said you volunteer at the homeless shelter, but do you do anything else for work at all?"
168,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been doing some administrative work from from home because of covid, so with the extra time I've been trying to to do some extra volunteering."

168,RES,doctor,"OK. Yeah, alright so uh other than that, sorry, I think I might have forgotten to ask you a couple questions. So no fainting spells, no shortness of breath, nothing like that?"
168,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like that, just a stern cough."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and no chest pain on exertion?"
168,RES,patient,"No, it's the chest pain, well, I guess if I'm like moving around a lot, but it's not, it doesn't come on uh, like because of like physical activity. I just feel it like anytime I'm, like when I'm breathing in or even just moving my body around in the chair."
168,RES,doctor,And any like fatigue or increased tiredness.
168,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've had some fatigue for sure."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you lost any weight recently?"
168,RES,patient,"Yeah, I I have actually. I'm I'm down 20 pounds. I thought that was great. I I was 200 pounds just two months ago."
168,RES,doctor,And have you been trying to lose weight or that 20 pounds just went away spontaneously?
168,RES,patient,"Uh, I mean I I guess I've tried to make changes to my diet here and there because of the diabetes, but I don't really think that it would be enough to lose 20 pounds."
168,RES,doctor,"OK, I see. Yeah so, do you have any questions? Those are all the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
168,RES,patient,"No, I was just, I guess just concerned about the the blood in the, in the cough."
168,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely that's something concerning. We want to make sure there was no, so you work at a homeless shelter, where there may be a tuberculosis case, and your symptoms of coughing up blood as well as losing a significant weight recently, and some of the other symptoms that you described as well, point towards uh TB as one of the causes. No lung cancer history right, in your family?"
168,RES,patient,No.
168,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm so we definitely want to do testing for TB. Will do us a smear today of your sputum and we will, since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact a public health if the tests come back positive, and it seems that, we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?"
168,RES,patient,"Not right now. Guess will wait until some of the results come back and yeah, get started."
168,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so we'll just do the TB test first, alright?"
168,RES,patient,"Alright, thank you."
168,RES,doctor,"Welcome, take care."
169,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
169,RES,patient,"Yeah, so uh I'm just bringing my son uh here to the clinic. He's been having um just I think he's been complaining of uh ear ache in his uh I think it's mainly in his left ear for the last, I'd say at least a week. Um he's been kind of just having discomfort um and over the last few days uh he also started crying because of how much pain he is having, and then um we also noticed that he had like was just feeling warm, so we took his temperature and he actually had a fever just yesterday of like 39 degrees Celsius."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, alright. So let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start? You said a couple of days ago, so was that two, three, four days?"
169,RES,patient,"Uh I think the discomfort like uh, we saw him scratching his ear for the whole last week, but uh the crying actually started just I would say four days ago, um."
169,RES,doctor,OK.
169,RES,patient,So I think the last few days have been really tough for him.
169,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so three, four days. OK, have you taken a look into his ear? Like does does it seem red? Is there discharge?"
169,RES,patient,"Uh I think we did see some uh, just like it wasn't red or anything, but I think we did uh see some um just kind of clear to almost uh clear to yellowish fluid from his affected ear."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, clear to, you said white-ish?"

169,RES,doctor,"Left ear, OK. And the right ear looks normal?"
169,RES,patient,"Yeah, right ear, he hasn't been complaining uh at all. I haven't even looked at the right ear yet."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, is he itching his ears at all?"
169,RES,patient,"Uh he was he was itching like pretty much this whole week, but I think right now he's hesitant to even touch his ears."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, and does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears?"
169,RES,patient,I can't really see anything on the outside.
169,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all?"
169,RES,patient,"Um he still like answers to us and like I don't think his ear, hearing is affected."
169,RES,doctor,"OK. Has he had any past issues with his ears, like ear infections or like hearing issues in the past?"

169,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Were they were they treated with antibiotics?"
169,RES,patient,"Uh I think one time they were, but I I'm pretty sure that was on, in his right ear."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. He's never had to get like tubes inserted or anything like that?"
169,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."
169,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Um, alright. Um has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"

169,RES,patient,"No, nothing else."

169,RES,patient,I just took it yesterday but uh he was feeling a bit warm yesterday so we just took it and it was like um 39 degrees Celsius.
169,RES,doctor,"OK, OK sweet. Um so 39 degrees, so he does have a fever uh for sure. We'll take his temperature again today just to make sure. Have you been giving him anything for his high temperature, like Tylenol?"

169,RES,doctor,"OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?"
169,RES,patient,"Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago."
169,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?"
169,RES,patient,No.
169,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?"
169,RES,patient,"Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now."
169,RES,doctor,"Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work."
169,RES,patient,OK.
169,RES,doctor,"Yeah, how does that sound?"
169,RES,patient,That sounds good. Thank you so much.
169,RES,doctor,"OK, great, thank you."

171,RES,patient,"Oh, uh no allergies."
171,RES,doctor,"OK alright um well it looks like um I, it's great that you brought him into the emergency room. Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely. We'll also check his vitals and um we'll do uh, yeah, we'll go from there. Do you have any questions?"

172,RES,doctor,OK. How long have you been smoking for?
172,RES,patient,"I started smoking in high school, so when I was 18 years old."
172,RES,doctor,Mhmm.
172,RES,patient,"And at that time I would have about 6 cigarettes a day, but then I like I, I knew that smoking wasn't good for me, so I'm trying to cut it down, but my friends still smoke, so sometimes when I go out with them, I'll just have a cigarette or two, maybe like once a month, I would say."
172,RES,doctor,"Once a month, OK. OK. And then any other recreational drugs like marijuana or cocaine or anything like that?"
172,RES,patient,"I tried a few in high school but not since then. I had, yeah, I had cocaine once."

172,RES,doctor,"And, and where do you live right now?"
172,RES,patient,"Uh, I live, I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, about 20 minutes from here."
172,RES,doctor,"OK. Any old carpets at home? Dust, mold, asbestos, anything that would be triggering your cough?"
172,RES,patient,I don't know. I have not really had a problem but been here at this place for about a year and a half.
172,RES,doctor,OK.
172,RES,patient,It is an old building but it's been OK so far. No recent changes.
172,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"
172,RES,patient,"No, I was just worried this cough isn't, isn't serious, right? You don't think I have Covid?"
172,RES,doctor,"So because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we're going to get a swab on you done and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER."
172,RES,patient,For sure. Thank you.
172,RES,doctor,"Yeah, take care."
173,RES,doctor,"Umm, how may I help you?"
173,RES,patient,"So yeah I've been having for the last two days, uh, it just started randomly. I had to miss work, Just a headache started at the beginning and then I noticed the same day, so this was two days ago. A headache started and my body just started aching throughout the day and yesterday I just developed, I think it was a fever, I didn't really get a chance to check, like, but I was very chilly yesterday and now I have this cough as well."
173,RES,doctor,"OK, so just to confirm, so the, the symptoms at first started with a headache and, and fatigue, and that started two days ago?"
173,RES,patient,"Yeah, like with fatigue, like also just the, my muscles were aching."
173,RES,doctor,"OK, and any particular muscles that were achy or is this more of a, uhm, general kind of whole body feeling?"
173,RES,patient,Just a general whole body feeling.
173,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, and in terms of the headache, could you describe, uhm, could you describe the headache?"
173,RES,patient,"Yes, it's just kind of like at the front like near my forehead, on, on kind of like both sides more. It just feels like, like pressure in there."
173,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had headaches like this before?"
173,RES,patient,"Uh, no, not really."
173,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, is the headache on one side or, or the other or on both sides?"
173,RES,patient,I think it's like both sides.
173,RES,doctor,"And is the headache like pulsating or is it more, continuous kind of constant pain?"
173,RES,patient,I think it's more continuous constant.
173,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you had any sensitivity to light or sound that, that's made the headache a lot worse?"
173,RES,patient,"No, it's, it's kind of just there, it's about the same as when it was when it started."
173,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that, the headache or anything else?"
173,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
173,RES,doctor,"OK. And so, and then, last question for the headache piece. Does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset, worst headache of your life sensation?"
173,RES,patient,"Uh, no, it's still like, like I can still cope with it, like, if I wanted to I would have gone into work. But it was the muscle aches that really started bothering me."
173,RES,doctor,"OK. And so you had a cough as well, when did this start, and is it a dry or wet cough?"
173,RES,patient,"It's a dry cough and it started yesterday, probably in the morning when I woke up."
173,RES,doctor,"OK, and has the cough been getting any better or worse?"
173,RES,patient,"Uhm, since yesterday I would sayit's probably a bit worse now."
173,RES,doctor,"Alright, and it's dry, but have you seen any blood that's come up?"
173,RES,patient,"No, no, no blood."
173,RES,doctor,And have you had any shortness of breath?

173,RES,doctor,"OK, no, that's great. And that reminds me, actually, how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight changes?"
173,RES,patient,"Not really, like I, I, I think over the last two years I've just been very focused on my fitness, so I feel like I've probably lost around 30 pounds over the last year. Last one to two, yeah, year, but like I, I've been exercising a lot like uhm, gym every day, it's, it's been, it's been a journey."

173,RES,patient,"Uh, unfortunately I do have to, uh, I'm one of the unlucky ones that still has to go into work. And yeah, it's it's hard to say like at work, there are times when we, like at lunch we eat like without a mask. I don't know if, I didn't notice anyone having any symptoms, but like, I don't know if someone, you know, who knows where anyone has been."
173,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so nobody that you're aware of who's been sick though?"
173,RES,patient,No.
173,RES,doctor,And everybody at home has been OK?
173,RES,patient,"Yeah, at home everyone's good. I kind of just distance myself into like one room."
173,RES,doctor,Mhm.
173,RES,patient,Just in case anything goes wrong.
173,RES,doctor,OK. And have you traveled anywhere?
173,RES,patient,"No, we've been, we've been at home this whole time."

173,RES,patient,No. Never.
173,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, and do you drink alcohol?"
173,RES,patient,"Yeah, well just occasionally, like I would say maybe, maybe some wine, once, uh, like once every couple days. Maybe a beer on the weekend, but that's it."
173,RES,doctor,"Alright. So I think that was all I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that, that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and?"
173,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I, I, I don't know if I should get a test done, like for covid. Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?"
173,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days."
173,RES,patient,"OK, I'll do that. That sounds good."
173,RES,doctor,"Alright, thank you."
174,RES,doctor,So what brings you in here to the ER?
174,RES,patient,"Well, I thought I should start by saying I was recently hospitalised for pneumonia. I left five days ago, but as soon as I left that evening, I started coughing again and now I have all the same symptoms. I have a cough, I'm feeling short of breath and I have a feeling like I have a fever."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, and before you were discharged the day, can you let me know what you had and what kind of things were you treated with?"
174,RES,patient,"I was treated with some antibiotics, I don't know exactly which ones. They said I had some sort of bacterial pneumonia."
174,RES,doctor,OK. But then it got resolved and they sent you home?
174,RES,patient,"Yeah, that's right."
174,RES,doctor,So are your symptoms similar to when you got admitted?
174,RES,patient,"They are similar, but I feel like they are also worse now."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, worse, OK, so you're having a cough, shortness of breath and fever, and did that all start together? Or did one come before another?"
174,RES,patient,"Um, so the cough came first, then the shortness of breath, and then the fever."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, and the cough, how would you describe the cough?"
174,RES,patient,"Um, it's harsh, it's persistent."
174,RES,doctor,Are you producing any sputum?
174,RES,patient,"Um, I guess a little bit, yeah. Yeah, I guess a little bit and it's yellow."
174,RES,doctor,"It's yellow, OK, do you notice any kind of blood in your sputum?"
174,RES,patient,"No, no blood."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, so just yellow sputum and how much would you say you're producing an average day?"
174,RES,patient,"Um, maybe like, 10 to 15 times in a day I produce enough to fill like the inside of my palm."
174,RES,doctor,"OK. And with the fever, did you get a chance to measure, take a temperature at all?"
174,RES,patient,"Umm, no, I haven't actually taken my temperature."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, but you've been having chills and are you having any other symptoms?"
174,RES,patient,"Yeah, chills. I've been feeling kind of hot during the day."
174,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. And how about the shortness of breath, is that just during activity or you can have that when you're sleeping or resting as well?"
174,RES,patient,The shortness of breath is more with like activity when I'm walking around.
174,RES,doctor,OK. And have all these symptoms been getting worse at all?
174,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'd say they're getting worse now. It's like this everyday and it's definitely getting worse."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, do you feel dizzy or lightheaded at all?"
174,RES,patient,"Um, no."

174,RES,patient,"No, I went straight home."
174,RES,doctor,And any recent travel?
174,RES,patient,"No, no recent travel."
174,RES,doctor,"OK, any headaches?"
174,RES,patient,No headaches.
174,RES,doctor,Any nausea or vomiting?
174,RES,patient,No.

174,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?"

175,RES,doctor,"OK, so not in any particular area, just kind of all over your stomach?"
175,RES,patient,"Yeah, like, I mean, I guess sort of like in the center, more so, but I can't really put one finger on the spot."
175,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it constant or does it come and go?"
175,RES,patient,It kind of comes and goes.
175,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, is it associated with eating food at all, or does it get better when you defecate?"

176,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so well, certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever. And if you do and it's high enough, that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis,  and if so, with some of your symptoms, including the discharge, obstruction, loss of smell, and facial pain, that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again. So that might require antibiotics, but we will check your temperature and go from there."
176,RES,patient,"Alright, sounds good, thank you so much."
176,RES,doctor,Thank you.
177,RES,doctor,So what brings you here today?
177,RES,patient,"Yeah I have my 2 year old daughter here with me. I don't know what's happening with her, but she seems to be getting really sick. So I'll give you that kind of timeline. So two days ago she was feeling hot and her fever hasn't broken. We've been giving her Tylenol, but she still seems to have a fever. The last time I checked her temperature was 38.5 and she seems to have issues swallowing food. She's drooling and she seems short of breath."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did she start getting short of breath?"
177,RES,patient,That started yesterday.
177,RES,doctor,Has her fever been getting worse or has it stayed around the same?
177,RES,patient,"So I just checked the first day. It was like 38, 38.5."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?"
177,RES,patient,That started yesterday as well.
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and has it been getting worse at all?"
177,RES,patient,I think so. Now she's barely even drinking fluids.
177,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?"
177,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've noticed some of that."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, you see a lot of redness in there?"
177,RES,patient,"I see, yeah, I see quite a bit of redness in there."
177,RES,doctor,And has she been drooling at all?
177,RES,patient,"Yeah, a little bit today."
177,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, any coughing?"
177,RES,patient,Not hat I noticed.
177,RES,doctor,"No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself? Or is she irritable?"
177,RES,patient,"Yeah, she's very irritable."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, do you notice any kind of paleness or blueness in her skin? Anything like that?"
177,RES,patient,She's not blue. She's looking a little pale though.
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and sorry, when did the shortness of breath start? Is it getting worse at all?"
177,RES,patient,"Shortness of breath started yesterday as well, moreso today which is why I brought her in."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting or diarrhea or constipation?"
177,RES,patient,"Um, no nothing like that."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and how's her appetite and sleep?"
177,RES,patient,"It's been, it's been not great. She's not eating well, I guess because she's in a lo of pain and she didn't sleep well for the past two nights either."
177,RES,doctor,"OK uhm, has she had any recent infections at all, like a cold or anything like that?"
177,RES,patient,"She did have a cough 2 weeks ago, yeah."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?"
177,RES,patient,"I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?"
177,RES,patient,"I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, any past medical history?"
177,RES,patient,"Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis."
177,RES,doctor,Any issues during pregnancy or after birth at all?
177,RES,patient,No.
177,RES,doctor,Are her immunizations are up to date?
177,RES,patient,"Um, yes, she didn't get the H. flu vaccine though."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, any hospitalizations or anything like that in the past?"
177,RES,patient,"Um, no."
177,RES,doctor,"OK, and any family history of any medical conditions?"
177,RES,patient,"Um, no."
177,RES,doctor,"And currently, who does she live with at home?"
177,RES,patient,I'm she lives with myself as well as her older brother.
177,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, so yeah those are all the questions that I have."
177,RES,patient,Do you think this is like an urgent matter?
177,RES,doctor,"Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?"
177,RES,patient,"Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?"
177,RES,doctor,"So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER."
177,RES,patient,"OK. OK yeah, that sounds good."
177,RES,doctor,"So I'll give them a call right now, and, uh, you can head over to the ER. Or if you need a ride, we can arrange to do that for you too."
177,RES,patient,"OK, great, that sounds great."
177,RES,doctor,Thank you.
177,RES,patient,You too.
178,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
178,RES,patient,"So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?"
178,RES,doctor,"OK, do you have any chest pain?"
178,RES,patient,"No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing."
178,RES,doctor,OK.
178,RES,patient,"So yeah, that's, that's that."
178,RES,doctor,"And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?"
178,RES,patient,"Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, have you brought up any blood?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?"
178,RES,patient,"Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today. Uhm, so uhm, so you mentioned that you have had some throat tightness. Have you had any loss of smell or, or loss of taste?"
178,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
178,RES,patient,"No, no nausea or vomitting."
178,RES,doctor,"How about, any diarrhea or Constipation?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,And have you had any urinary problems like painful or frequency?
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,OK and have you had any night sweats over the last several weeks to months?
178,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
178,RES,doctor,"And, uhm, have you had any weight changes over the last little while?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,OK. And have you noticed any skin changes or rashes?
178,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I, I do have just like the general, like, eczema, that I use a cream for, but that's just normal for me."
178,RES,doctor,"OK. And any muscle aches or, or joint pains?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,Have you had any fatigue?
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,"OK, alright you mentioned asthma as part of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?"
178,RES,patient,"No, it's just asthma and it was diagnosed, I think when I was like, probably 11 or 12 years old."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you use inhalers for that?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one."
178,RES,patient,"The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, so you don't need it that that often then?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,"Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?"
178,RES,patient,"Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and, and do you use any other medications?"
178,RES,patient,"Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?"
178,RES,patient,Not that I know of.
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and are your immunizations up to date?"
178,RES,patient,Yeah.
178,RES,doctor,"Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates. I just go to college and I'm living with three other roommates."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and has anybody been sick?"
178,RES,doctor,And have you traveled anywhere?
178,RES,patient,"Uhm, I decided, like, I, yesterday I went home like, to my parents house and helped my dad, that's where I was cleaning the basement. But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?"
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?"
178,RES,patient,"Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time."
178,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?"
178,RES,patient,No.
178,RES,doctor,"Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time."
178,RES,doctor,"OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?"
178,RES,patient,"No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. And do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?"
178,RES,patient,"Uh, no if I, if I really want marijuana, I would have to go with edibles, I, I can't take the smoke."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, I see and, do you drink alcohol?"
178,RES,patient,"Uh just, I would say probably on the weekends I might have four or five beers."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, and, anybody else in the family have asthma or skin irritation like, like you have?"
178,RES,patient,"Yeah so my, my older sister actually also was diagnosed with asthma. She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?"
178,RES,patient,"My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life."
178,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?"
178,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help."
178,RES,doctor,"Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult."
178,RES,patient,"Yep, sounds good."
179,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
179,RES,patient,Hi I'm here with my son and he's just been feeling awful. He just has this runny nose and he's been sneezing all the time and uh I don't know maybe he has allergies or something? I just came in 'cause I wanted to get him checked out and maybe get some medications. He's just feeling horrible.
179,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure when did when did the sneezing and runny nose start?"
179,RES,patient,"He he's had it for um, he's just always kind of, you know he's always having that runny nose. You know kids always do but it's just been pretty bad over the past um two weeks."
179,RES,doctor,"Past two weeks. OK. What started first, the sneezing or runny nose?"
179,RES,patient,Uh the runny nose kind of just got worse a little bit over the past uh two weeks and then the sneezing kind of started at about the same time.
179,RES,doctor,OK and and the runny nose is he having um like what colour is it?
179,RES,patient,It's just clear like.
179,RES,doctor,"Clear. OK. Does he ever feel like he's uh, do you ever feel like he's stuffy?"
179,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, kind of. He's just been snorting and sniffing and um I don't think he knows how to blow his nose yet. But he's like clearing his throat, so I think he's he's a little bit stuffy."
179,RES,doctor,Okay.
179,RES,patient,"But he hasn't complained about difficulty with breathing or like, he's been, like he sleeps with his mouth closed. So I think he he should be able to breathe OK."
179,RES,doctor,"OK, good, so you said no shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Has he had any coughs?"
179,RES,patient,"Kind of. In the morning, so I I see that whenever he wakes up in the morning, he just has to like clear his throat a lot and like cough and then um gets better."

179,RES,patient,"Um, a little bit."

179,RES,patient,Oh yeah.
179,RES,doctor,OK.
179,RES,patient,"It usually gets worse um uh I guess like around this time, uh I can tell when spring is coming up. Um, it gets pretty bad, but he always has a runny nose um and he sneezes sometimes here and there."
179,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned this has been going on for more than four days this time around?"
179,RES,patient,"It's been, it's been going on for the past uh two weeks."
179,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and is it like um impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to um like, sleep?"
179,RES,patient,"Uh it does affect his sleep sometimes he doesn't like um, just the itching really bothers him."
179,RES,doctor,Mhmm.
179,RES,patient,"So he can't uh, he finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, I usually, that's when I give him the the medications. To help him fall asleep."
179,RES,doctor,OK. OK. And uh is he up to date with all his immunizations?
179,RES,patient,Yeah.
179,RES,doctor,"OK. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?"
179,RES,patient,Uh I have asthma.
179,RES,doctor,OK. And is your asthma severe?
179,RES,patient,"Uh no, it's it's pretty well controlled. I used to, actually, I used to have asthma as a child."
179,RES,doctor,"OK, I see."
179,RES,patient,It's pretty well controlled right now. I don't even need medications.
179,RES,doctor,"OK, OK."
179,RES,patient,"I remember I used to, I used to get allergies as well as a child."
179,RES,doctor,Oh I see.
179,RES,patient,"But very similar, lots of sneezing and yeah."
179,RES,doctor,"Mhmm, alright. Were you ever, did you ever take like an allergy test?"
179,RES,patient,"No. I didn't think about it, I just never, like my my my parents didn't take me to get that testing done."
179,RES,doctor,"OK, how about your son? Has he been allergy tested?"
179,RES,patient,"No, but I feel like he probably should."
179,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. And then, does anyone at home smoke?"
179,RES,patient,No.
179,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Um do you have any, like old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos at your place?"
179,RES,patient,"Uh we've got all of, we got our carpets uh removed uh two years ago. That's actually helped uh with his symptoms. Uh and I know, we tried it, we removed the curtains as well and we've used blinds. So yeah."
179,RES,doctor,OK.
179,RES,patient,"And I don't think so, I don't think there's any spores or things like that."
179,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Um, is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise, like he's growing, gaining weight OK, like he's, his motor skills and like social behaviours are all up to par with his peers?"
179,RES,patient,Oh yeah he's doing great.
179,RES,doctor,OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
179,RES,patient,No.
179,RES,doctor,"No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?"
179,RES,patient,Sounds great.
179,RES,doctor,"OK, great."
179,RES,patient,Thank you.
179,RES,doctor,No problem.
180,RES,doctor,What can I do for you today?
180,RES,patient,"Um yeah, so I'm here because I've had this fever, this cough, and now my head hurts. That's been going on for about the past four days and I just want to make sure um it's nothing too serious."
180,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah, that's great. So can you tell me, have you, did you measure your temperature?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh no, I haven't actually measured it, I just feel hot and feel chills."
180,RES,doctor,"OK, but we can take your vitals here um and uh you you said that you've had a cough for the past four days, dry cough or wet cough?"
180,RES,patient,Um it's been pretty dry.
180,RES,doctor,"Um, any uh no blood or any um sputum um coming up right?"
180,RES,patient,"No, no."
180,RES,doctor,"OK and has the the cough gotten worse or better or the same, has it been the same since the past four days?"
180,RES,patient,Um it's it's actually getting worse.
180,RES,doctor,"OK, is there anything that makes it better or worse?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."
180,RES,doctor,OK. Uh have you tried anything for your cough?
180,RES,patient,I've tried like decongest like cough suppressants but it doesn't seem to have helped.
180,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and then tell me about your headache. That started four days ago as well?"
180,RES,patient,Yeah.
180,RES,doctor,And uh where exactly is it?
180,RES,patient,So it's like just on the front part of my head.
180,RES,doctor,"And does it feel like uh, what does it feel like? Is it like a throbbing sensation? A band like sensation? Um is it sharp, is it dull?"
180,RES,patient,Uh it feels pretty throbbing right now.
180,RES,doctor,Is it both sides or on the uh left or right?
180,RES,patient,Uh it's it seems like it's both sides.
180,RES,doctor,"If you had to give it a number from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe pain ever, what number would you give it?"
180,RES,patient,Uh I would give it about like a seven.
180,RES,doctor,"Oh wow, OK. And how's it changed over the past four days?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh, it's just gotten a little bit worse."
180,RES,doctor,"Um is it uh is it, what was I gonna say, is it constant or does it come and go?"
180,RES,patient,Um It seems pretty it seems pretty constant.
180,RES,doctor,Have you taken anything for it?
180,RES,patient,I tried like some Tylenol for it and it seems to help a little bit.
180,RES,doctor,"Does it, is there a certain time of the day when it's worse? Before going to bed, at the end of the day, waking up, anything like that?"
180,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
180,RES,doctor,Have you had a similar headache in the past?
180,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, I guess I have, a little bit in the past, but that was also when I was like sick."
180,RES,doctor,"Sure, um does it wake you up in the middle of the night?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh no, it hasn't woken me up."
180,RES,doctor,"OK, um I guess other than the headache, I'll ask you about, and the cough and fever, I'll ask you if you've had any other symptoms. So have you had any confusion?"

180,RES,doctor,"OK, any family history of lung or heart problems uh or anything else, or cancers?"
180,RES,patient,No.
180,RES,doctor,And do you currently live alone or do you live with someone else or with other people?
180,RES,patient,I live with um my husband and our our daughter.
180,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any, have you traveled anywhere?"
180,RES,patient,"No, not recently."
180,RES,doctor,"Have you uh, what do you mean by recently?"
180,RES,patient,Uh like I have traveled in the past two years.
180,RES,doctor,"OK, that's fine, that's fine. Have you had any contact with anyone who might be sick? Either you or your husband or your daughter?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh no, I don't think so."
180,RES,doctor,Have you gone out of the home at all?
180,RES,patient,Uh just to do like essential things like groceries and the bank and things like that.
180,RES,doctor,Do you wear a mask and maintain social distancing?
180,RES,patient,Yes.
180,RES,doctor,"OK um alright, uh do you drink alcohol?"
180,RES,patient,"I drink like once once in a while, have a glass of wine."
180,RES,doctor,"OK, how, I guess how often would you say?"
180,RES,patient,Uh once a week.
180,RES,doctor,OK. And do you smoke?
180,RES,patient,"Um no, not anymore."
180,RES,doctor,Uh how much did you smoke in the past?
180,RES,patient,"I I'd have like half a pack, um but I only smoked between like the age of 20 to like 25."
180,RES,doctor,OK. Do you smoke marijuana or have any edibles with marijuana in it?
180,RES,patient,No.
180,RES,doctor,Any recreational drugs?
180,RES,patient,No.
180,RES,doctor,"OK um alright well uh, and you said that you don't have a family history of any problem?"
180,RES,patient,No.
180,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, alright, I think that's all the questions I had for you. So uh looks like you've had a fever, cough, and a um and a headache that's gotten worse in the past four days and your headache's pretty bad, a seven out of ten. Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home. Um and uh I guess a couple of other questions that I wanted to ask and I should have asked earlier, do you have any um any stiffness in your neck or any difficulties moving your neck?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
180,RES,doctor,"OK alright, and um do you have any questions?"
180,RES,patient,"Uh No, that's it. Thank you so much."
180,RES,doctor,Great.
181,CAR,doctor,It sounds like that you're experiencing some chest pain.
181,CAR,patient,"Yeah, so this chest pain has just been coming on for the last couple of weeks now."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, uhm. So 2 weeks, and can you tell me kind of where you're feeling that pain?"
181,CAR,patient,"Um yeah, I'm I'm just feeling this chest discomfort, sort of over on the left side."
181,CAR,doctor,"The left side, OK. Does does it stay just in one spot or does it kind of spread anywhere else?"
181,CAR,patient,"No, I don't really feel it anywhere else. Yeah, I just feel it in that one spot on the left side."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, does it feel dull and achy, or does it feel more sharp?"
181,CAR,patient,It feels pretty sharp.
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, and is it constant like on all the time, or do you feel like it kind of comes and goes?"
181,CAR,patient,It comes and goes. I would say I it might last for um 20-30 minutes at a time and then it goes away.
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, and over the last two weeks since you said it started, has it gotten any worse?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uh, no. It's been about the same."
181,CAR,doctor,"About the same, OK, and has it gotten more frequent, these like 20 to 30 minute episodes?"
181,CAR,patient,"No, it's happened about two or three times during the 2 weeks."
181,CAR,doctor,"And if you were to rate it on a scale of zero to 10, zero being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you've ever felt, where would it fall?"
181,CAR,patient,I would say a 4 out of 10.
181,CAR,doctor,"OK. Uh, can you think of anything that that you've done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain?"
181,CAR,patient,"Um,  I don't know I've separated from my husband 2 two years ago which has been really stressful but other than that I mean I can't really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, but do you feel like you have been more stressed out in general?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uh, yeah the last couple of years have been a lot more stressful because of those issues in my personal life."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that you're coming in and we can hopefully get to the bottom of this. Not that I think that's necessarily the source of your pain, and we definitely want to look into everything, but it is really helpful to know that. So when you've had these episodes, have you taken anything to help with the pain or done anything that's that you felt it made it go away?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uhm, I've tried some Advil, some Tylenol and actually some Tums as well, and it hasn't really helped."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, do you think it's worse when you're moving around, if you're if you're kind of doing more exercise, or is it kind of just the same no matter what you're doing when you get the episodes?"
181,CAR,patient,"Oh, it actually I I feel like it happens most of the time when I'm either at work or or driving."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK. OK, and before this two week period, have you ever had anything like this before?"
181,CAR,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like this happen before."
181,CAR,doctor,Do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for?
181,CAR,patient,"No, previously healthy."
181,CAR,doctor,"And just jumping back to these pain episodes when you have them, do you experience anything else? Do you get any nausea or vomiting?"
181,CAR,patient,No.
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, do you get any, do you have any difficulty breathing during these times?"
181,CAR,patient,"No, I haven't."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed any fevers?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uh, no, no fevers."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick recently?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uhm, no, I haven't."
181,CAR,doctor,And have you traveled anywhere outside of Canada?
181,CAR,patient,"No, I've been home."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK so you have, you said you have been previously healthy, nothing that you've been seeing your family doctor for on a regular basis. Do you take any medications?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uhm, I do not, no medications, just the Tylenol and Advil I tried for the pain."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, do you have any allergies?"
181,CAR,patient,No allergies.
181,CAR,doctor,And is there any history of heart problems in your family?
181,CAR,patient,"Yeah, my father had a heart attack when he was 60 just last year and it's actually one of the reasons what concerns me about the chest pain that I thought I was having."
181,CAR,doctor,"For sure, it always feels very concerning when when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had issues like similar issues in the past. I don't know that this is related to that. I I personally don't think so at this point, but we're definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that. I'm going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general. Do you smoke cigarettes?"
181,CAR,patient,"Yeah, I smoke about half a pack to a pack per day. I've been trying to quit and I was smoking more one pack per day, but so it is down a little bit, but, It's still something I'm trying to work on."
181,CAR,doctor,"Congratulations, that's a really tough thing to do so, good for you. That's that's really exciting. Step in the right direction, right? Do you drink alcohol?"
181,CAR,patient,"Um, I do, but, uh, I'll have maybe one or two glasses of wine on the weekend."
181,CAR,doctor,Do you use any other substances?
181,CAR,patient,Uh no.
181,CAR,doctor,"I know that you said you don't see your family doctor for anything regularly, but I just want to check a couple of specific things like have you ever been told you have high blood pressure?"
181,CAR,patient,"No, I've never been told I've I've had high blood pressure."
181,CAR,doctor,And have you ever been told you have like high cholesterol?
181,CAR,patient,"I haven't, but I've actually never been tested either."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, and do you exercise regularly?"
181,CAR,patient,"Yeah, actually, I'll either do some running or cycling, probably three or four days per week and I haven't had any chest pain or or problems exercising."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, that's good to hear. And have you ever had problems with heartburn?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uh. I don't think so, no."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK. OK, so just to kind of summarize what we've talked about, over the last two weeks, you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that's on the left side, it feels more sharp, is that correct?"
181,CAR,patient,Yeah.
181,CAR,doctor,"And it's kind of constant when it comes on, there's nothing really that makes it better or worse, it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so, it has kind of stayed the same over over the last two weeks, hasn't really gotten worse or better, it hasn't gone away either?"
181,CAR,patient,"Right, yeah exactly."
181,CAR,doctor,"You never had anything like that before and you have been, it sounds like experiencing some stress in your life, it definitely can play into that as well. OK, is there anything else that you wanted to to tell me about that I didn't ask you today?"
181,CAR,patient,"Uh, no, I think that's um, yeah, I think that's all that I wanted to talk about today."
181,CAR,doctor,"OK, so what I'm going to do is bring all this information to your family doctor and we can come back together and talk to you about the next steps."
181,CAR,patient,"Awesome, thank you."
181,CAR,doctor,Thanks for coming in.

182,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would really like that. Thank you."
182,RES,doctor,"You're welcome. Um yeah, but those are all the questions I had for today. We'll definitely do like a physical examination, but it seems you've just been having a cough for the last two weeks."
182,RES,patient,Yeah.
182,RES,doctor,"Without any other symptoms. Um, okay, so do you have any questions at all for me?"
182,RES,patient,Um no.
182,RES,doctor,"So what we'll do is, since you've had this cough for the last two weeks, we definitely want to do a COVID swab, just in case. You've been uh, working from home, but if there was any potential contact, they usually, it comes back in 24 to 48 hours."
182,RES,patient,Okay.
182,RES,doctor,"Other than that, sometimes uh, with a history of smoking, you can have something called uh, COPD. We can, like after the physical examinations and everything, we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function tests as well. Um, and yeah, but other than that, it can also just be like a dry cough, can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes two or more weeks to resolve. In that case we wouldn't really."
182,RES,patient,Sure.
182,RES,doctor,"Um, yeah, so we'll do the physical examination and then go from there."
182,RES,patient,Sounds great.
182,RES,doctor,"Alright, take care."
183,RES,doctor,So what brings you in today?
183,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've had, I've had a cough for a number of years now, but store these past like day, it's gotten a lot quite a bit worse and I've been really short of breath."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, and so how many days would you say you've been short of breath?"
183,RES,patient,"Less than a day, maybe just really kind of started last night and has carried out throughout this morning. I, I called this morning to get an appointment."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, and it, was it brought on by any activities or were you doing anything at that time before it started?"
183,RES,patient,"No, last last night I was, well, I was just doing my regular kind of routine after dinner - cleaning up and just the cough started first. And over, the over the night it got worse. I could just couldn't catch my breath and that was similar this morning."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, so you've also had a cough."
183,RES,patient,"Yeah I have. Yeah, uh, I've had a cough for a long time now, but it's been worse over this last day."
183,RES,doctor,"Yeah, is it like a wet cough or dry cough?"
183,RES,patient,"It's wet, I I'm bring up sputum most of the time, but it's been, it's usually like white or clear and it's a lot more like, uh it's a lot more greenish, yellow and, yeah."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you having any kind of fevers or chills anything like that?"
183,RES,patient,"Uhm yeah I, I did have some chills last night, so I'm not sure about a fever though."
183,RES,doctor,"OK. And are your symptoms at all, so you do have a shortness of breath, but any kind of chest pain at all?"
183,RES,patient,"I do have some chest pressure for sure. I just feels like I can't, can't ah, catch my breath."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, so is it mostly related to your breathing or do you have it at rest? Or do you have it with any exertion?"
183,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think it, it's there kind of most of the time, like the chest pressure. I kind of feel it throughout my chest when when I'm breathing but, but also just kind of sitting here I can kind of feel it."
183,RES,doctor,OK I see. And are all of your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?
183,RES,patient,They've been constant and they've got been getting worse since since last night.
183,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had this happen to you before?"
183,RES,patient,"It has, yeah, I, actually last last winter I was hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation for, for a few days. I I know I got some antibiotics and umm, I needed some oxygen."
183,RES,doctor,I see and did you go home on home oxygen at all? Like do you use oxygen at home?
183,RES,patient,"No, I was told I didn't need any any yet, but if I didn't quit smoking I might in the future."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you using any kind of puffers at all?"
183,RES,patient,"Yeah, I I do I I use I think it's called like Spiriva or something like that. I use that every day and there's another one that I'll use like if my symptoms are getting bad. My blue one. I did try that actually last night and it didn't, it helped a little bit, but, not not enough."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, so have you just tried like tried it one time last night? Have you tried it after that?"
183,RES,patient,"Yeah, we just tried it last night."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, so nothing today right?"
183,RES,patient,"No, nothing today."
183,RES,doctor,"OK. Other than that, so you did have an admission before for this. And you have COPD. Do you have any other symptoms right now? Like runny nose, sore throat, any cold like symptoms?"
183,RES,patient,"No, no, I I I don't."
183,RES,doctor,Did you have it before these symptoms started?
183,RES,patient,"Uhm no, I've been feeling, I've been feeling OK."
183,RES,doctor,OK. And have you traveled at all recently?
183,RES,patient,"Uh, well, I did, I just go up to the trailer not too long ago to visit some family, but that's just an hour away."
183,RES,doctor,OK. Anyone sick around you recently?
183,RES,patient,"No, I don't, I don't think so."
183,RES,doctor,"And is there, are you having any headache or nausea or vomiting?"
183,RES,patient,"No, I haven't had anything like that."
183,RES,doctor,"OK. And besides the time you got hospitalized, have you had any exacerbations after that?"
183,RES,patient,"No, I just had that, had that happen, the one time, last year."
183,RES,doctor,"OK. And do you feel that your symptoms are similar, worse, or how do they compare to last time, if you remember?"
183,RES,patient,"Pretty similar. I think last time I was worse, but I waited longer last time and so that's why I was concerned and and wanted to come in early."
183,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, uh, alright, so uh, have you had any fevers at all or chills?"
183,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've I've had some chills last night like I just couldn't get warm. I was loading up on blankets and it didn't seem to help."
183,RES,doctor,OK so we'll get a temperature on you today as well. Do you feel that you're breathing faster at all?
183,RES,patient,"Uh, not necessarily it, just it just harder to to, feel like I can't catch my breath."
183,RES,doctor,"OK, do you feel fatigued at all?"
183,RES,patient,"Ah yeah, I I have a, I mean I have been feeling just tired this morning, but I think that's more to do with the fact that I just can't really do a whole lot of exertion because as soon as I move around I'm, I can't breathe."
183,RES,doctor,"I see. Uhm OK, and are you having any kind of diarrhea, constipation, or any urinary troubles at all?"
183,RES,patient,"No, I'm not."
183,RES,doctor,OK. Any changes in your sleep or appetite?

184,RES,patient,"Oh, I didn't get that this year."
184,RES,doctor,"OK, well we recommend that you you get your vaccines and um also the uh HPV vaccine. Um it's it's best to get the HPV vaccine earlier on. It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier. And let's go back to your symptoms, then. Have you had any surgeries?"
184,RES,patient,"Uhm, I got my appendix removed when I was 13."
184,RES,doctor,Anything else?

184,RES,doctor,"Yeah, sure, OK. Um and uhm, I suppose just um OK. What was I gonna ask? Um do you uh, so no travels, OK. Do you feel like you've been in contact with someone who might be sick or might have Covid?"
184,RES,patient,Uh I don't think so.
184,RES,doctor,"No, OK alright. And have you looked at your throat? Does it look swollen or red?"
184,RES,patient,"Yeah, it looks pretty swollen and red."
184,RES,doctor,"Well, that's all the questions, oh one more question actually. Do you have um any medical conditions that run in the family?"
184,RES,patient,"Um no, I don't think so. Maybe like high blood pressure."
184,RES,doctor,"Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result. Do you have any questions?"
184,RES,patient,"Um no, that sounds great, thank you."
184,RES,doctor,OK sounds good.

185,RES,patient,I've felt hot yes.

185,RES,patient,No chest pain.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, and any throat pain?"
185,RES,patient,"Yeah, my throat's been a little sore, but I thought it was maybe just because I was coughing so much."
185,RES,doctor,OK and any issues swallowing food?
185,RES,patient,"Umm, no problems swallowing food."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in your smell?"
185,RES,patient,"Now that you mention it, yeah I thought it was maybe just plugged up, but I haven't really been able to smell these last few days."

185,RES,patient,No.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any night sweats or chills?"
185,RES,patient,Nothing like that.

185,RES,patient,"Yeah, I tried some uh like day and night time Tylenol at home to sleep but still, when I woke up in the morning, still not feeling very good and the cough is still here too."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?"
185,RES,patient,"Maybe as a kid. I mean, I remember getting the flu. I had a cough and that sort of thing, but I haven't been sick for several years now."
185,RES,doctor,"OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed? How are you feeling worse? Or do you feel kind of the same as when it started?"
185,RES,patient,I would say I feel a bit worse.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, and has anyone around you been sick recently?"
185,RES,patient,"Umm, no, not that I know of. Yeah, everybody in the house has been OK."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
185,RES,patient,"Umm, yeah, I was visiting some cousins up North several weeks ago, but that was just traveling within the province."

185,RES,patient,"No, I'll use my Tylenol or Ibuprofen or Advil I guess if I get the occasional headache.  And I guess, umm, something like Reactine or Claritin for the seasonal allergies but that's about it."
185,RES,doctor,OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?
185,RES,patient,"Umm, no, just usually like in the springtime."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
185,RES,patient,Yeah I am. Yeah I get the flu shot every year.
185,RES,doctor,"OK good. And in terms of family history, do any of your family members have lung conditions or heart conditions?"
185,RES,patient,"I know mom has high blood pressure, but nobody's had a heart attack or, uh, no lung conditions either."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, any cancers that run in the family?"

185,RES,doctor,"OK, and then do you smoke?"
185,RES,patient,I just I smoke cannabis every once in awhile.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, how much do you smoke?"
185,RES,patient,"Um, I would say maybe, I enjoy it on the weekends."
185,RES,doctor,Did you say a joint on the weekends?
185,RES,patient,Yes.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, so is that like 1 milligram?"
185,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say something about that. Yeah, it's not much."
185,RES,doctor,OK. But no cigarettes though?
185,RES,patient,No.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, any other recreational drugs?"
185,RES,patient,No.
185,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
185,RES,patient,"Umm, I do, yeah, I'll have like two or three beers on the weekend."
185,RES,doctor,Sure. And and where do you live?
185,RES,patient,I'm just like 20 minutes down the road in a house here.
185,RES,doctor,"Sure, is it an apartment complex or is it like a full house?"
185,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's a single family home. I live there with my wife and three kids."
185,RES,doctor,"OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?"
185,RES,patient,"Actually last year we had most of the carpets taken out, so not anymore."
185,RES,doctor,OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?
185,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that."
185,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?"
185,RES,patient,"Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back."
185,RES,doctor,"Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have."
185,RES,patient,"OK, awesome, thank you."
185,RES,doctor,"Yeah, thank you."
186,RES,doctor,What brings you in here?
186,RES,patient,"I've had this cough for over a week now, and it just hasn't gone away."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, so this cough has been going on for a week. Can you describe the cough a little bit for me?"
186,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I mean sometimes I produce sputum and sometimes I don't. It's uh, white and whiteish clear in color."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and it's been going on for more than a week.Has it been getting worse?"
186,RES,patient,"It got a little bit worse at first, but then it's been kind of the same, um, since."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed at all, um, like green or yellow color of your sputum or any blood tinged sputum?"
186,RES,patient,"Uh, No blood, and maybe a little yellowish."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, little yellowish, OK. And how much would you say you bring up, um, on an average day?"
186,RES,patient,"Uh, a couple of teaspoons."
186,RES,doctor,"Couple of teaspoons OK.OK, has there been anything that um, makes it worse or better?"
186,RES,patient,Nothing that I can think of.
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had this happen to you previously in the past?"
186,RES,patient,No.
186,RES,doctor,"And is the cough uh, constant or does it come and go?"
186,RES,patient,"It comes and goes, uh, throughout the day. No particular time of the day it's worse."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and, um, are you having any, uh, other symptoms besides the cough, um, like shortness of breath,sore throat, um, runny nose, congestion, anything like that?"
186,RES,patient,"Uh. yeah, I've had, um, a sore throat, uh, and a headache, as well."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the sore throat start?"
186,RES,patient,"Um, that started about five days ago."
186,RES,doctor,Five days ago? And has it been getting worse?
186,RES,patient,"No, that's been about the same."
186,RES,doctor,"And do you have any difficulty, uh, swallowing at all?"
186,RES,patient,"It's a little sore, but, uh, it's been OK, to eat and drink."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed any kind of redness in your throat or any swelling around your neck?"
186,RES,patient,"No, I took a look in the mirror as best I could with my phone and I couldn't really notice anything that looked red."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about the headache? When did that start?"
186,RES,patient,"So it's been, uh, kind of off and on over the past, uh, week or so. Um, feels like a like a pressure sensation and my head is just really squeezing."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and um. So is it on one side of your head or both sides?"
186,RES,patient,Both sides.
186,RES,doctor,And it's Kind of like a pressure and squeezing. Is it at all pulsating?
186,RES,patient,No
186,RES,doctor,"No? OK, Is it constant or does it come and go?"
186,RES,patient,It comes and goes.
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you taken any medications to make any of these symptoms better?"
186,RES,patient,"Yeah, I have used some Advil for the headaches and over the counter medicine at night time to help sleep."
186,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh,and do you recall doing anything in the last few weeks which you might believe that Uh, caused some of these symptoms? like for example, were you in contact with anyone that was sick at all?"
186,RES,patient,"Well, I'm a nursing student and I've been on rotations in the hospital recently."
186,RES,doctor,"And anyone that you probably saw in the hospital, anyone sick that you were in contact with?"
186,RES,patient,"I did see some people who had, like, infectious symptoms."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and other than that, have you been having any fevers or chills?"
186,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've felt chills."
186,RES,doctor,"OK chills, and when did you feel them?"
186,RES,patient,"I've been feeling chills throughout the day and at night, I just feel like I can't get warm even with a blanket on."
186,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you taken your temperature at all?"
186,RES,patient,No.
186,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, we can do that for you today. Uh, other than that any recent travel outside of the province."
186,RES,patient,"No, been just at school."

186,RES,doctor,"You said it's more than a week now, right?"
186,RES,patient,Yes.
186,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so what we will do today is, uh, first of all, with the pandemic going on, with some of these symptoms, we need to rule out coronavirus. And so we will be getting a swab done for you as well today and considering you are having these symptoms, we will also get another test done for you today to see if there's any bacteria causing what we call walking pneumonia. It's community acquired pneumonia that's fairly common in like the younger population. And so we'll see if you could have that. And so from there we'll see if we need to put you on any antibiotics which will help you. And if we need to get any blood work or X Rays we'll let you know as well. Is that OK? And if you feel like you have worsening symptoms like shortness of breath, you need to make sure you come back to the Emergency Department."

187,RES,doctor,"And does it usually happen during the day, throughout the night or does it have any sort of pattern?"
187,RES,patient,"I would say that it doesn't really have a pattern. The sore throat is always there and the fever started a day back and it seems to break sometimes, but right now there is no real pattern to it."

187,RES,doctor,And is it just with solids or do you get the soreness with liquids too?
187,RES,patient,"I would say mostly with solids, sometimes with liquid. If it's like really cold or something."

187,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, so yeah, overall it seems that you had this sore throat which is constant, getting worse and a bit of a fever in th last one or two days and you've also had swelling in your neck and so yeah, do you have any other questions or concerns?"
187,RES,patient,"No, like what do you think I have? Do you think it's COVID?"
187,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already."
187,RES,patient,"OK, sure I can do that."
187,RES,doctor,"Yeah, do you have any questions?"
187,RES,patient,"No, that sounds good. Thank you so much."

188,RES,doctor,"OK, so you mentioned the sore throat started three to four days ago and the chills started yesterday. And is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
188,RES,patient,"Yeah, it seems like appetite's gone down, like a lot of pain in his throat, especially when swallowing solid foods."
188,RES,doctor,"Have you taken a look into his throat? Is it red? Do you see any yellow streaking white stuff, anything like that?"
188,RES,patient,"I definitely did take a look yesterday and definitely saw a lot of redness. I don't know if I saw any white or yellow streaks, but definitely looks very red in there."
188,RES,doctor,"OK, do his tonsils look enlarged?"
188,RES,patient,"Uh, everything looks swollen in there, I don't know what's what, but it does look very angry in there."

188,RES,patient,"No, no, he hasn't told me anything about that."
188,RES,doctor,Any appetite changes?
188,RES,patient,"Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing I'm trying to make sure that he gets like liquids because over the last few days he can't tolerate like solid foods at all."
188,RES,doctor,"Yeah, how about a weight loss over the past few weeks?"
188,RES,patient,"No, not really. t's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself."
188,RES,doctor,OK. Alright and has he been healthy otherwise?
188,RES,patient,"Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him."
188,RES,doctor,"OK, have you tried anything for his sore throat? Anything over the counter?"
188,RES,patient,"We did try, uh, like Tylenol cold. It helped with this headache, but it didn't really help with his sore throat"

188,RES,patient,I think probably in his late 30s with type 2 diabetes.
188,RES,doctor,"Type 2, OK and then any sick contacts recently that he may have had?"
188,RES,patient,"I don't think at home at least, uh, but maybe at school, like you never know who they are in contact with, so I'm wondering if he just picked it up somewhere from school."
188,RES,doctor,OK.
188,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, they're all wearing masks right now, but I don't know if he picked something something up from his classmates."
188,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. OK, and then any travel to anywhere recently?"
188,RES,patient,"No, we've been at home, haven't left even to go to like a different city, have been in London the whole time."
188,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, and who does he live with at home?"
188,RES,patient,So he lives with myself and his dad.
188,RES,doctor,Any siblings?
188,RES,patient,"No, he's an only child."
188,RES,doctor,"OK, any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?"
188,RES,patient,"You know we don't have any pets. We don't have any like old carpets, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue."
188,RES,doctor,"Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?"
188,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I think those are everything I wanted to talk about but I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or like if there's anything we can do today for him."
188,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?"
188,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good."
188,RES,doctor,"OK, great thank you."
188,RES,patient,Thank you.

189,MSK,doctor,"OK, and um, do you smoke cigarettes?"
189,MSK,patient,"Uh no, I don't."
189,MSK,doctor,"Alright, how about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or uh or anything else?"
189,MSK,patient,No.
189,MSK,doctor,"Alright. Um and is there any, uh, like musculoskeletal or like autoimmune conditions that run in the family?"
189,MSK,patient,"Uhm no musculoskeletal issues uh that, I know diabetes runs in the family."
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, um alright, so that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So next I just wanted to do a physical exam, and just looking at the left knee, are you seeing any um swelling or redness uh on the knee?"
189,MSK,patient,Um it appears slightly more swollen than my right knee.
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, but are you seeing any redness?"
189,MSK,patient,No redness.
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are there any temperature changes? Like does the knee feel hot or or warm?"
189,MSK,patient,No.
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, and if you um press along the uh joint line, do you feel any pain?"
189,MSK,patient,"Uhm yeah, it feels a little tender."
189,MSK,doctor,"OK. And how about pain over any of the muscles, like the thigh muscles or the hamstrings or the calf muscles?"
189,MSK,patient,"No, those are fine."
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then how about any pain over the patella or kneecap?"
189,MSK,patient,That that's a little bit more painful.
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you able to bend your knee uh like like flex it, straighten it?"
189,MSK,patient,"Uh I can do that, it's just painful when I do that."
189,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um and uh and then how about walking, are you um, do you have an antalgic gait or or or a limp?"
189,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, no, well, I guess I'm I'm putting more weight on my right knee so it might appear to some people that I do have a slight limp."
189,MSK,doctor,OK. And any issues with moving your hip or your ankle?
189,MSK,patient,Uh no.
189,MSK,doctor,"OK, um so I think that was everything I wanted to ask and check today. Did did you have any questions?"
189,MSK,patient,"Um yeah, so um how do you, how can I treat my knee?"
189,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly, so it it sounds like um this could be most likely osteoarthritis um of the left knee, which uh is something that would be best treated with uh trying to stay as active as you can, but but also pacing your activities as well, so that you're not um doing so much that the next day you're in significant amount of pain, but it's important to remember that um activity will help um with keeping your knee mobile, but also um actually help with reducing pain as well, and then also uh you could use Tylenol um as a medication for it. I wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or NSAIDs on a long term basis, although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain. Um and then also like topical agents such as um like Voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on, we can consider something like a steroid injection as well."
189,MSK,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
189,MSK,doctor,"Alright, thank you."
190,RES,doctor,What brought you in today?
190,RES,patient,"Yeah absolutely. I have had this awful, awful headache for the past, two days I wanna say, its horrible."

191,RES,doctor,"OK, when you say the past couple of days, do you mean two days, three days, four days?"
191,RES,patient,"I would say the last two days, yeah, just yesterday and today."
191,RES,doctor,"OK, so loss of taste, so you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're just not getting the full depth of your taste?"

191,RES,patient,"I mean, I guess I could have been dehydrated. I didn't even think of that, but I mean, since the food didn't taste so great, I don't know. I probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days. Maybe I haven't eaten as much."

191,RES,doctor,"OK, and is there any tobacco in there or nicotine?"
191,RES,patient,"I think there might be, but umm, I don't know. I usually just buy the flavored ones."
191,RES,doctor,"OK, well, you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine, because neither of those are good for your health. And so we can, you know, have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that."
191,RES,patient,"Yeah, sure."
191,RES,doctor,I'll just continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?
191,RES,patient,"Umm, no."
191,RES,doctor,And who do you live with?
191,RES,patient,"I live with my mom, my step dad, and then my younger sister."

191,RES,doctor,"OK, in the city you said?"
191,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I live close. I go to high school not too far from here."
191,RES,doctor,"Oh, that's nice. And any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know, like it being an old building, old carpets, mold, anything like that?"
191,RES,patient,"No, I live in a nice place. It's usually like really clean."
191,RES,doctor,"OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?"
191,RES,patient,I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID.
191,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?"
191,RES,patient,"Yeah, that makes sense."
191,RES,doctor,"OK great, well have a great day."
191,RES,patient,"Yeah, thank you."
192,RES,doctor,How may I help you today?
192,RES,patient,"Hi, um so for the past week or so I've um I've had this cough um and some shortness of breath. I feel hot and I just feel kind of uh fuzzy like I just I can't concentrate on things very well. I get confused sometimes so I thought I'll come to you to get it checked out."
192,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah it's it's that was a really good idea to come in to get checked out. Um so can you uh, I'll talk I'll ask about each symptom a little bit. So starting with the shortness of breath can you um tell me how uh bad the shortness of breath has been?"
192,RES,patient,"Uh it's been sometimes it's not so bad, some other times it's really bad. Um at first it wasn't that bad, but now like I'm having a hard time taking a deep breath in. Um it hurts and I just feel like I can't walk like 2 blocks even before getting short of breath."
192,RES,doctor,"And uh before this week how much did, did you ever feel short of breath before this?"
192,RES,patient,"No, nothing like this before."
192,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Um do you feel that the shortness of breath has gotten kind of worse over time?"
192,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
192,RES,doctor,And what about the cough? Did that start at the same time as the as the difficulty with breathing?
192,RES,patient,Um it started before the difficulty with breathing.
192,RES,doctor,"Can you, uh is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"
192,RES,patient,"Um it was it was a dry cough at first, but now I'm seeing some phlegm um and it looks kind of yellow."
192,RES,doctor,Have you seen any blood in the phlegm?
192,RES,patient,No.
192,RES,doctor,"Uhm and, uh, are you hearing any wheezing sounds?"
192,RES,patient,"Yeah, a little bit."
192,RES,doctor,"OK. Um how uh, has the cough sort of improved or gotten worse over time?"
192,RES,patient,Um it's it's gotten worse.
192,RES,doctor,OK. And you mentioned you also you also have a fever. Did you check your temperature?
192,RES,patient,Um I did I it was like 38.5 this morning.
192,RES,doctor,"And have you been checking your fever this past week, or was that the first time you, um, checked it?"
192,RES,patient,It's the first time I checked it. I I've felt hot though in the past and I've felt like I had chills.
192,RES,doctor,"Yeah. You're also feeling a little bit fuzzy. When did that start, and can you explain that a little bit?"
192,RES,patient,"That started about um, I think like yesterday morning. Um I just feel fuzzy like I can't concentrate on things as much as I used to be able to. And the other day I uh was cooking something and then I forgot I was cooking it. Um yeah, just a little bit confused."
192,RES,doctor,Did you leave the stove on?
192,RES,patient,"No, no, I had turned it off. I just forgot I left like the pot on the stove and made dinner."
192,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and you feel like this is very new, that this has not been going on for weeks or months where you forget things or having difficulties with concentration?"
192,RES,patient,No this has never happened before.
192,RES,doctor,"Uh OK. I'm gonna ask you about a couple of other uh symptoms just to make sure that you don't have any other um, just to get a full picture. So do you have a headache at all?"
192,RES,patient,"Um no, no headache."
192,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in your vision or your uh hearing that has that has uh been very sudden or that has happened over the past week?"
192,RES,patient,No.

192,RES,doctor,OK. And um any chest pain?
192,RES,patient,"Yeah, it hurt hurts when I try to take a deep breath in."
192,RES,doctor,When did that start?

192,RES,patient,"Um no, not really no"
192,RES,doctor,OK. Do you get any chest pain otherwise um in this week when you're not trying to take a deep breath?
192,RES,patient,"No, there's no chest pain at rest."

I just want to get a good listen to your lungs and take all your vitals as well. However, yeah so after that since you're having some symptoms of what might be a pneumonia, it can be a bacterial infection, a viral infection, we will have to get some blood work done as well as a chest x-ray. And right now, with the pandemic going on, we will also do Covid swab test for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?"
193,RES,patient,"Yeah, that makes sense, thank you."
193,RES,doctor,"Alright and, if if you're while you're here, if your shortness of breath gets any worse at all, just let us know and we'll help you out."

194,RES,doctor,"Okay, so those are all the questions I have for you today. Any questions for me?"
194,RES,patient,No.
194,RES,doctor,"Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?"
194,RES,patient,No.
194,RES,doctor,"Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?"
194,RES,patient,Yeah.
194,RES,doctor,"Alright, so we'll be with you shortly."
195,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
195,RES,patient,"Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried."
195,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. What started first?"
195,RES,patient,"I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that."
195,RES,doctor,OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?
195,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?"
195,RES,patient,I did it under the armpit.

195,RES,patient,No.
195,RES,doctor,"OK, and did he seem wheezy?"
195,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
195,RES,doctor,"No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?"
195,RES,patient,"Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting."

195,RES,patient,"No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment."

195,RES,patient,"Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out."
195,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?"
195,RES,patient,"Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer."
195,RES,doctor,OK.
195,RES,patient,"But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?"
195,RES,patient,"Yeah, no issues there so far."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?"

195,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And who does he live with at home?"
195,RES,patient,"Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?"
195,RES,patient,"Uh, no nothing like that."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?"
195,RES,patient,"No, I think that was all."
195,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?"
195,RES,patient,That sounds good. Thank you.
195,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, no worries."
196,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
196,RES,patient,"Hey, I just, um, I just kind of came in to talk about my stuffy nose. It's yeah, it's been a problem for, I don't even know how many years it's always been there. And now that school is a little less busy and things are virtual and have more time, I decided I'll get something done, um, to get it fixed."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and how long has this been going on for?"
196,RES,patient,"Since I was young, um like maybe years, couple years."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and then do you like how often are you getting the stuffiness? Is it like every day? Is it during the day at night? When do you usually get it?"
196,RES,patient,"It's kind of uhm, it's kind of all the time, to the point that I've somewhat gotten used to it. And it's just my, it's only on the left side and it's just always kind of stuffy. Initially I would have trouble falling asleep 'cause it would, I would just find it a little bit bothersome, but now I'm kind of just used to it."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side."
196,RES,patient,"Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and so you have stuffiness. But do you ever get any kind of discharge or drainage from your nose?"
196,RES,patient,Sometimes I get a little bit bleeding.
196,RES,doctor,"Are you, OK. Um, bleeding? Is it blood mixed into the discharge or drainage? Or is it like you get nosebleeds?"
196,RES,patient,"I get nosebleeds like maybe yeah. Like maybe when I'm exercising or something I'm like at the gym. Uhm, fom doing the gym class. Yeah, yeah when playing with my friends."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and how often do you get these nose bleeds?"
196,RES,patient,Uhm? Maybe once a month or once in two months.

196,RES,patient,No.
196,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and do you find that you have to constantly clear your throat at all throughout the day?"
196,RES,patient,"Uhm, no."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you at all feel that some stuffiness drains back into your throat at all anytime during the day?"
196,RES,patient,"I don't think so, no."
196,RES,doctor,So it's just the congestion that's been going on for quite some time and does it change with the seasons at all?
196,RES,patient,"No, it's just there all the time. Like I can't even tell. This is like my normal now, but my mom said I should get it checked out."
196,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm. Have you tried anything for it like either medications or the neti pot or steaming and has anything helped you at all?"
196,RES,patient,"I tried steaming but it didn't do much. It kind of got better. Maybe for an hour maybe, but then yeah, it didn't do much."

196,RES,doctor,"Ok. So yeah, so mainly yeah. So there's all the questions I had for you. Do you have any questions or concern?"
196,RES,patient,Nope.
196,RES,doctor,"Ok so there can be many different reasons for this chronic congestion and we'll do a full physical examination for you today. Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there. For now, we'll just do the physical examination to go from there."
196,RES,patient,"Great, thank you."
196,RES,doctor,"Welcome, take care."
197,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
197,RES,patient,"I brought my son in today because he had a fever that started two days ago and, and then since then he he's had a cough that started as well and it it he's been short of breath. It looks like he's like breathing faster and just having a harder time to breathe."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm, before the fever, did you notice any other symptoms, like a runny nose or a stuffy nose?"
197,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that. Yeah, the fever kind of came on pretty, pretty suddenly it seemed like."

197,RES,patient,"It's, uh, yeah, he is bringing up a little bit of sputum, yeah he's doing it."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, what color is the sputum?"

197,RES,patient,"Ii did, yeah."
197,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, how much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well?"
197,RES,patient,"I'd say ah, even at rest now he's like breathing faster."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, umm, and it does anything help with that? So does sitting up help? Or, uh, you know, getting fresh air or anything like that?"
197,RES,patient,"No. But you'd say, like taking a smaller breaths helps because like if he if he takes a deep breath and he gets, he gets like chest pain."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and how about when he's laying down?"
197,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't said anything like, like that for laying down just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said."

197,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and does she have a fever as well?"
197,RES,patient,"She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days."

197,RES,patient,"No, we've been at home."
197,RES,doctor,OK. Does anyone at home smoke?
197,RES,patient,No.
197,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And who lives at home with him?"
197,RES,patient,"So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister."
197,RES,doctor,"OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?"
197,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so. It's a newer home."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
197,RES,patient,"Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though."
197,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?"
197,RES,patient,That sounds great. Thank you.
197,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, no problem."
198,RES,patient,"I've been having this cough for around, I would say half a year now and I just can't seem to get rid of it."
198,RES,doctor,OK. And does this cough have any phlegm that you bring up?
198,RES,patient,"No, it's completely dry. I can't bring anything up."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and since the cough started, has it been getting getting worse, staying the same, getting any better?"
198,RES,patient,"It was pretty much the same for I would say like three or four months, but then I've noticed it getting more frequent over the last couple of months."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and six months ago, can you think of anything that that changed? Including like, traveling anywhere or changing in in your work or or living environment?"
198,RES,patient,"Uh, not really, uh, I'm like almost 75 years old now, so I just thought it was probably just due to my age."
198,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, have you been have you brought up any blood with the cough?"
198,RES,patient,"No, I've never brought up any blood."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you have had any shortness of breath?"
198,RES,patient,"Not that I've noticed, but I do find that I get a little bit more tired with exercise than I used to, but not really any shortness of breath."
198,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
198,RES,patient,"I don't know if this is just due to old age, but like I've noticed some joint pain as well, like in my hands and feet. I just assumed that was 'cause I'm getting old."
198,RES,doctor,"OK um, and has there been anything that's made the cough worse?"
198,RES,patient,"Sometimes when, I'm exercising a lot more but not not too much, it's kind of just always been there, hasn't really changed too much, but it's gotten more frequent over the last couple of months."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and anything that's made the cough better that you've tried?"
198,RES,patient,"No, nothing I've tried like everything. I've tried Tylenol cold, I've tried other home remedies but like like steaming and everything like that but nothing has really helped."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and is the cough worse in the morning, throughout the day or or at night?"
198,RES,patient,It's pretty much always there. It doesn't really change with any time of the day.
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and is the cough interfering with sleep?"
198,RES,patient,"Yeah, I sometimes I I do have coughing fits at night that wake me up. I do have"
198,RES,doctor,"OK. Um and, you mentioned some joint pains as well and then when did that those start?"
198,RES,patient,I would say over the last year is when I started noticing it a lot more than before.
198,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been having joint stiffness or or muscle stiffness early in the morning?"
198,RES,patient,"It does get a little bit more stiff in the morning, but it's kind of just there throughout the day."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any red hot or or kind of swollen joints?"
198,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, any injuries to any of your limbs or or joints that could explain some of the pains"
198,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of, nope."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and how has your energy been? Have you been experiencing a lot of fatigue?"
198,RES,patient,"Yeah, I definitely have been more tired. I can't really even go outside for a walk sometimes or I get really tired working in the garden. So it's been tough."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did that when did you notice that change and and how were you different before?"
198,RES,patient,"Like before, like before six months ago, I remember I used to be able to go for long walks around the block, then when I was gardening I can go on for hours, but now I'm pretty it's pretty limited to like maybe 15-20 minutes and then I have to go back into the house."
198,RES,doctor,"I see OK, so pretty big difference over the last six months to a year for you."
198,RES,patient,Yeah.

198,RES,doctor,"I'm sorry to hear that. What did you say you retired, what did you do for work previously? Did you have any exposures to chemicals or asbestos products while while at work?"
198,RES,patient,"Not that I remember, no it was it was a pretty, pretty much like a desk job I would say."
198,RES,doctor,"OK um, so no reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that?"
198,RES,patient,"Um, not really, but I I do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos. Does that does that like count at all?"
198,RES,doctor,"Like a it could be important, uh, because, uh, well how long, how long did you live there for?"
198,RES,patient,I would say almost 20 years.
198,RES,doctor,"OK, so um, yes, that definitely would be is is important for the history today because, unfortunately, long term exposure to asbestos when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you've been describing along with cough and uh, respiratory symptoms. So it'll be something that we'll be sure to investigate today, OK? But I just had a couple more questions. First, do you smoke cigarettes?"
198,RES,patient,"I quit long time ago, more than like 10 years ago, but I used to smoke like 5 to 10 cigarettes for around 20 years."

198,RES,doctor,"Alright, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
198,RES,patient,No.
198,RES,doctor,"OK, so those are the questions that I wanted to go over to make sure I asked on history. Was there anything that else you wanted to tell me?"
198,RES,patient,"No, I think that's all."
198,RES,doctor,"OK, so next we'll do your physical exam and order some investigations. But currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as well as um, something called, well, it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you've been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease, and it doesn't sound like you have a family history of those, but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest X-Ray and a chest CT."
198,RES,patient,Sounds good.
199,RES,doctor,It's nice to meet you. What's your name?
199,RES,patient,"It's nice to meet you as well. My name is Jenn and I'm here with my son Joey here, who he's had a sore throat now for the last couple of days."

199,RES,patient,"No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that."
199,RES,doctor,"OK, so um, just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent and we do this thing called the Centor score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well."
199,RES,doctor,Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?
199,RES,patient,"Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you."

200,MSK,doctor,Does that hurt?
200,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah."
200,MSK,doctor,"OK so right hip flexion um also causes pain, and then would you mind uh folding your knees backwards um and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt?"
200,MSK,patient,Uh no.
200,MSK,doctor,"OK, so no pain at knee flexion. And how about when you point your feet um and toes up towards the ceiling?"
200,MSK,patient,"Uhm yeah I I do get some pain with my um, yeah when that's all straightened out, yeah."
200,MSK,doctor,"OK, so some pain on um planter flexion of the right foot. And how about if you um point your feet and toes towards the ground?"
200,MSK,patient,No pain there.
200,MSK,doctor,"OK, um alright and how about when you uh kick your legs uh to the side and upwards?"
200,MSK,patient,Oh uh no pain with abduction.
200,MSK,doctor,"OK so no pain on right hip abduction, and then how about when you bring it back down?"
200,MSK,patient,No.
200,MSK,doctor,"OK and no pain on hip adduction. OK, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions for myself?"
200,MSK,patient,Uh just wondering about possibly like what it could be.
200,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?"
200,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
200,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah no problem."
201,MSK,doctor,What brings you in here today?
201,MSK,patient,"I've had this pain in my back thats kind of like in my lower back and my buttocks and it's now radiating down to my right leg. I've had this for awhile now, but it's getting worse and I just want to come get it checked out."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how long have you had this pain for?"
201,MSK,patient,About a month.
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and has gone worse at all like did you have the it radiating through your leg before or is that something that happened after?"
201,MSK,patient,That's something that happened after that happens that that's been going on for the past week.
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is this pain constant or does it come and go?"
201,MSK,patient,"And it's pretty much always there, but certain things can make it worse. Like if I'm walking or doing certain activities it can it can make it worse."
201,MSK,doctor,OK. And did you have any back pain before this month?
201,MSK,patient,"No, not, I mean no, not really."
201,MSK,doctor,OK. An what kind of pain would you say it is. Is it like a sharp stabbing pain or is it more so a dull aching pain?
201,MSK,patient,"Um usually or well before it was like a mild achy pain, but now it can be. It's sharp and it feels like a burning sensation."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, a burning sensation, where would you say that burning sensation is?"
201,MSK,patient,It's like down my buttocks to the right leg.
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you feel any kind of numbness or tingling with it?"
201,MSK,patient,"Um a little, a little bit of tingling. Yeah, a little bit of tingling."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how would you rate the pain from a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've had in your life?"
201,MSK,patient,"So usually it's about like a 5 to 6 out of 10, but when it gets bad and um sharp, I'd give it an 8 out of 10."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are there any kind of motions or positions that cause you more pain?"
201,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so I'd say like just any sort of physical activity, like if I'm on my feet a lot, it hurts."
201,MSK,doctor,Mmm.
201,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that's pretty much the only thing that I can think of right now."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, did anything happen one month ago or before this pain started. Like any injuries or falls that might have caused this pain?"
201,MSK,patient,"Um no like a long time ago, like 6-7 years ago I injured my back at work but. I just did some conservative treatments for that and it went away."
201,MSK,doctor,OK was it your lower back.

201,MSK,patient,"No, those are kind of the only regions that I'm experiencing it right now."

201,MSK,patient,I would say ext.. Extending my back hurts more.
201,MSK,doctor,OK and you get pain with sitting down?
201,MSK,patient,Um sometimes.
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about lying down?"
201,MSK,patient,"Um lying down I guess it depends on the position. If I am straight on my back it's it's not too bad, but if I like I'm hunched over or something like that, it hurts."
201,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see OK and have you tried any medications over the counter and painkillers that have helped?"

201,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?"
201,MSK,patient,"Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for?"
201,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI."
201,MSK,patient,OK
201,MSK,doctor,"And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there."
201,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you."
201,MSK,doctor,You're welcome. Take care.
202,RES,doctor,How can I help you today?
202,RES,patient,"Um yeah hi, I brought I brought my 8 year old daughter here um because I've noticed that she's been quite wheezy um for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough, um sounds like she's a little short of breath, so I just wanted to get things checked out."
202,RES,doctor,"OK, so for the, when it first presented, about four to five days ago, what did you notice, notice first?"
202,RES,patient,Um I noticed that she was wheezy um and it's it seemed like she was having some difficulty taking in deep breaths.
202,RES,doctor,"OK, now was this with any type of activity or just at rest?"
202,RES,patient,"Yeah, she was playing tag with one of her cousins and she she was quite out of breath after."

202,RES,patient,It's been fluctuating.
202,RES,doctor,"OK, but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later?"
202,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's just it would, she would have these these uh episodes, but it would resolve on its own and then she would, you know go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again, but when she rests um then it goes away, so I wasn't really sure, too sure what to think of it. But now I think it's important to get it checked out, so here we are."

202,RES,doctor,"OK, and when she's having these wheezy episodes, do you ever notice that she looks like she's really straining to breathe, really struggling?"
202,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, so she, it's not like she turns blue or anything like that, um she just slightly slightly has a hard time catching her breath."
202,RES,doctor,"OK, so these usually recover on their own?"

203,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm. OK, I think that that about covers my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?"
203,RES,patient,"Um no, I don't think so."
203,RES,doctor,"OK. I’m going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?"
203,RES,patient,"No, thank you very much."
203,RES,doctor,OK well thanks for chatting with me we should be back shortly to kind of let you know with the next step.
203,RES,patient,"OK, great, thank you."
203,RES,doctor,Thanks.
204,RES,doctor,What can I do for you?
204,RES,patient,"Hey I I came in here today I I just was feeling just a bit short of breath over the last few days and I've had a so I normally have a cough, but I've just been coughing a lot more over the last week and I don't know if it's if it's something else. I I do have a COPD diagnosis which I was diagnosed with like a couple years ago, but this is this seems to be much worse."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, you said you were diagnosed with COPD couple years ago. Was that two years ago? Three years ago?"
204,RES,patient,"It was almost, probably five years ago."
204,RES,doctor,"Five years ago, OK, and have you always had this cough since then?"
204,RES,patient,"Yeah I’ve probably had a cough for the last 10 years, I think."
204,RES,doctor,OK.
204,RES,patient,Yeah.
204,RES,doctor,And you you’ve mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week?
204,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been coughing a lot more. Even just walking down the stairs from my bedroom to even the kitchen I just have to take a little bit of a breather, just start coughing."
204,RES,doctor,OK. And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlem?
204,RES,patient,"No, I'm bringing up like this. It's usually before this week. It was like kind of a clear to yellow. Sorry clear to white material, but this past week it's been more yellow in color."

204,RES,patient,"So that's just in the last few days. But just to clarify, I do get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use puffers, but the last few days I've just been really short of breath, even even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and, can't really catch my breath."
204,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?"
204,RES,patient,"Uhm no, not really, it's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, how about when you're asleep? Does it wake you up and kind of make you gasp for air?"
204,RES,patient,No.
204,RES,doctor,"No OK. So no orthopnea or PND. Alright, and the puffers that you're on, can you remind me which ones you're on again?"
204,RES,patient,"So I'm on this one called Ventilin for the which I’ve been using a lot more recently just for relief and then, I'm on this other puffer thing. It's called spiriva."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, how often? How? How many times this week have you had to use your ventilin?"
204,RES,patient,"Uhm, Ventilin are probably used. Probably almost like 10 times this past week."
204,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, any chest pain?"
204,RES,patient,"Uhm? Just when I'm having like those coughing fits in with the breathing, I feel some discomfort, but that's it."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Alright and then any palpitations or feeling like your heart's racing?"

204,RES,patient,"I was on like a diuretic. Then the doctor said, like my blood pressure was really well under control, so I just stopped taking it."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and the doctor was OK with that."
204,RES,patient,"Uh no, I just stopped taking it. I didn't really like ask the doctor."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure and that's something you should keep an eye on as well, just in case ou have complications with your kidneys. Does that sound OK?"
204,RES,patient,Yeah.
204,RES,doctor,OK uhm? And are you on any medications other than the puffers?

204,RES,patient,"Uhm? My father had lung cancer but he smoked a lot, I also smoke so I sometimes worry about that, but he had cancer and my mother, she was perfectly healthy. Yeah, so just my father."
204,RES,doctor,Just your father OK. How much do you smoke?
204,RES,patient,"Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even 2 packs at one point in time, but right now it's half the packaging."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs like cannabis, heroin, cocaine?"
204,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that, no."
204,RES,doctor,OK. And do you drink alcohol?
204,RES,patient,Um just probably maybe like a couple times a month.
204,RES,doctor,Couple times a month OK. And are you currently married?
204,RES,patient,"Yeah, I currently live with my sorry, wife, in an apartment."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, and any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?"
204,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"
204,RES,patient,"No, not not really. Wie’ve been just to ourselves."
204,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"
204,RES,patient,"No, just been on our house."
204,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?"
204,RES,patient,"Uh, yeah I was just wondering what this can be."
204,RES,doctor,"Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG’s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We’ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?"
204,RES,patient,That sounds good. Thank you.
204,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, no problem."
205,RES,doctor,What brought you in today?
205,RES,patient,"Hi, um so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days um and just before that I had a stuffy nose um and I had a sore throat, well I still do, um and it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have covid or what it is."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, so if I understand, it started with a stuffy nose?"
205,RES,patient,Yes.
205,RES,doctor,OK and that kinda progressed to a fever?
205,RES,patient,"Yes, that's right."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been feeling any other symptoms aside from the fever?"
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,"Nothing really, have you had any nausea, any vomiting at all in the last little while?"
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,Any pain anywhere else in your body?
205,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, do you have any neck stiffness?"
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,Any headaches?
205,RES,patient,"Um no, no headaches."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been able to eat and drink during this time period?"
205,RES,patient,Yes.
205,RES,doctor,"Excellent. OK, you've had a cough at all?"
205,RES,patient,No cough.
205,RES,doctor,"No cough, OK and then how about abdominal pain, any pain in your tummy?"
205,RES,patient,Um no.
205,RES,doctor,"Nothing like that, what about other changes in your body? Have you noticed any fevers or any rashes, any skin changes?"
205,RES,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
205,RES,doctor,"OK. What about any pain in any of your joints and your knees, hips?"
205,RES,patient,"Oh, actually um not in my joints, but I've just, there there has been some muscle ache."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, how long has that been going on for?"
205,RES,patient,Uh for the past two three days.
205,RES,doctor,So around the same time that you've had this fever?
205,RES,patient,Mhmm.
205,RES,doctor,OK.
205,RES,patient,That's right.
205,RES,doctor,Now have you had any contact with anyone who's been sick in the last little while?
205,RES,patient,"Um no, not that I can think of."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any recent travel anywhere else?"
205,RES,patient,"No, I did go hiking um last weekend, um and it was about 2 hours away, um there were some people on the hiking trail that I passed by, but um other than that, no travel outside the province."
205,RES,doctor,OK. Does anyone around you or in your immediate circle come down with anything similar recently?
205,RES,patient,Um my husband has also been experiencing similar symptoms for the past week.
205,RES,doctor,"OK, how's he doing?"
205,RES,patient,Uh the same as me.

205,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you leave the house for work at all?"
205,RES,patient,"No, I work from home."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds good. So you have some muscle aches, little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, do you have any difficulty swallowing?"
205,RES,patient,"Uh no, it just hurts."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're still able to swallow food, swallow liquids?"
205,RES,patient,"Yes, that's right."
205,RES,doctor,It doesn't feel like anything is going down the wrong way or have any coughing after you swallow?
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,"OK. And just in terms of coming back to this sore throat, do you feel like you have any swelling around your neck? Does it feel inflamed or swollen?"
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,Nothing like that?
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, excellent. So you're eating well, doing well, any changes to your bowel movements recently?"
205,RES,patient,"Uh no, no."
205,RES,doctor,"OK, alright, I'll just kind of go into other things, just in terms of anything else that you might have had in the past, uh have you ever been hospitalized for any reason in your life?"
205,RES,patient,I had my gallbladder taken out five years ago.
205,RES,doctor,"OK, so that was around when you were 50 years old?"
205,RES,patient,Uh yes.
205,RES,doctor,OK. And any other surgeries you've had in your life?
205,RES,patient,Uh no.
205,RES,doctor,"No, anything you've had to see a doctor for?"
205,RES,patient,"Um I, in the past couple of years uh just for things like like this I guess um colds, um I'm pre diabetic, so I've been checking my glucose levels, yeah other than that nothing else."

205,RES,doctor,Do you drink alcohol?
205,RES,patient,Uh I drink once once in a while.
205,RES,doctor,"OK. And when you drink, how many drinks do you have?"
205,RES,patient,Um about one or two glasses of wine.
205,RES,doctor,"Got it. Any other recreational drugs, substances?"
205,RES,patient,"Um no,"
205,RES,doctor,"So no marijuana, heroin, cocaine?"
205,RES,patient,"I've tried marijuana before, just like edibles, but not, not regularly."
205,RES,doctor,Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?
205,RES,patient,No.
205,RES,doctor,"OK, and when was your last menstrual period?"
205,RES,patient,It was um a year ago.
205,RES,doctor,A year ago?
205,RES,patient,Mhmm.
205,RES,doctor,"OK. And then otherwise, so we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you have the hiking trip last week and you passed some people, but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now."
205,RES,patient,Yeah.
205,RES,doctor,"Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?"
205,RES,patient,"No, do you think I have covid?"
205,RES,doctor,"It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?"
205,RES,patient,"No, I haven't."
205,RES,doctor,"So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile."
205,RES,patient,"OK, sure."
205,RES,doctor,"Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?"
205,RES,patient,"Alright, great thank you."
205,RES,doctor,Take care.
206,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
206,MSK,patient,"Hi, I'm here because I've had this numbness and tingling in my feet for awhile now and I started to notice these open wounds on my feet as well and I'm not feeling it, but it's there."
206,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when did you first notice the numbness and tingling?"
206,MSK,patient,"It's been on going for the past like 2 years, but recently I've seen the past like 3 months it's gotten worse."

206,MSK,doctor,"OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?"
206,MSK,patient,Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?
206,MSK,doctor,"So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well."
206,MSK,patient,Mmmm
206,MSK,doctor,"Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well."
206,MSK,patient,"OK OK, thank you."
207,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
207,MSK,patient,"Hi, yes I've had this pain in my left elbow for a couple of weeks now and it's not getting any better so. I'm just here to kind of figure out what it is."

207,MSK,patient,"No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?"
207,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there."
207,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
208,RES,doctor,Could you tell me what brought you in today?

208,RES,doctor,"OK, did they tell you what the diagnosis was at that time, or just say that it was a viral infection?"
208,RES,patient,"No, they they said it could be bronchiolitis or just an upper viral infection."
208,RES,doctor,"OK, um any reasons for hospitalizations?"
208,RES,patient,"At that time that he had the bronchiolitis or viral infection, he was hospitalized for two days just to help his breathing."

208,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good, thank you."
209,RES,doctor,How are you doing?
209,RES,patient,Not so well I I feel like I've been having just worsening breathlessness and a cough for it's been going on for two years now and I just can't seem to get rid of it.
209,RES,doctor,"OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?"
209,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?"
209,RES,patient,"Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?"
209,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say so."
209,RES,doctor,OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?
209,RES,patient,"Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?"
209,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?"
209,RES,patient,It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath.
209,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?"
209,RES,patient,It can get up to I would say like an eight sometimes when I'm doing a lot of work.
209,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever experienced this before?"
209,RES,patient,"Not before the two years, before I I never felt anything like that."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned it's gradually been getting worse, right?"
209,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say so."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, and the cough, um, do you ever cough up any blood?"

209,RES,patient,"No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations."
209,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?"
209,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point."
209,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative."
209,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
209,RES,doctor,Thank you. Take care you too.
210,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
210,RES,patient,"I um. I just haven't been feeling very well over the past couple months. And I have decided I just come in and see what's happening, so I've just I've been feeling short of breath. And I kind of passed out sometimes and I'm really worried about it."

210,RES,patient,"Uhm? Kind of the same maybe a little bit worse, but I yeah maybe the same. Definitely not getting better."
210,RES,doctor,"OK, how far are you able to walk or exert yourself before you're short of breath?"
210,RES,patient,"I can walk quite a bit, um, but I, I guess like when I go for my my runs in the morning, I start feeling short of breath. It's maybe like, two blocks or three blocks."
210,RES,doctor,"OK, and any any symptoms where you get short of breath at night and where you had to get up and and put your feet over the bed?"
210,RES,patient,No.

210,RES,patient,"Hum, no."
210,RES,doctor,"Alright, so we will do some pulmonary function testing and get some imaging of your lungs today as well as an ECG and maybe a monitor for your heart as well to just check your heart racing for the next 48 hours.

211,RES,doctor,When did this start?
211,RES,patient,"Um, I would say started, uh probably 3 months back, but it's gotten worse, so like before I used to like just have some irritation in my throat and cough a little, but now, I would say probably every other day I'm having these episodes where I can't stop coughing when I'm exercising."
211,RES,doctor,"Hmm, um and is this cough a dry cough, or do you bring up some mucus?"
211,RES,patient,"It's usually, it's usually a dry cough and sometimes I do bring up like this light material, but usually it's mostly a dry cough."
211,RES,doctor,"You never notice any blood, right?"
211,RES,patient,"No, no blood."
211,RES,doctor,"OK and uhm, it started about three months ago, I guess before that did you ever have a problem when you would exercise or when you were vacuuming or cleaning, has this been a problem that has occurred for years and that's just something that you that got worse and now it's come to your attention? Or was it just very new and sudden, three months ago?"
211,RES,patient,"Um, it's fairly new. I've never really had this issue before although I have been like so like after the new year in the winter I, I, I wasn't much of the person who ran or exercised a lot. But I, I kind of needed a new goal to become more fit and active. So I notice that, I don't know, maybe that's why like, it is something new that I've been trying, but yeah, it's not been an issue before."
211,RES,doctor,"OK, and other than the the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms like a sore throat or itchy eyes? Itchy nose? Stuffy nose or runny nose? Anything like that?"
211,RES,patient,"No, none of those, but I did it, initially I used to get just an irritation in my throat. But now it's just more of a cough."
211,RES,doctor,"OK. Do you have, do you get any pain in your chest at all?"
211,RES,patient,"Uh, when I'm usually it goes away in 10-15 minutes but when I'm coughing a lot I do get some tightness."
211,RES,doctor,OK. Do you ever feel like you're short of breath when you're coughing or otherwise?
211,RES,patient,I do find that it's harder to take a breath at those times.
211,RES,doctor,Ok. Uhm and how long do these last for? Episodes last for?
211,RES,patient,"Probably, uh 15 to 20 minutes and yeah, it's it's mainly just after I like often times over the last few weeks I've had to just stop doing what I'm doing, like exercising and just come home and rest."
211,RES,doctor,Do you feel like your hearts beating really fast when that happens or you're sweating?
211,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I I feel like it's usually, I don't know if it's because of the exercise, but I have like a Fitbit and it's my my heart rate is much faster."

211,RES,doctor,Ok.
211,RES,patient,"Now, while the University has closed down, and by that I've lived there all my life before, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it."
211,RES,doctor,"Do you feel like they may have put new curtains or or like there's old carpets or new a new pet, or something that could have caused some irritation for you?"
211,RES,patient,"No, but I have noticed that when I when we vacuum. I, I do get some of those symptoms as well. Just more of an irritation mores than the cough."
211,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and do you feel that you're particularly anxious when these episodes are occurring? Do you have any new stressors in life?"

212,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, the shortness of breath is it happening at rest or exertion and how much exertion?"
212,RES,patient,"Uhm, I think it's happening mostly on exertion. Usually I'm able to walk around the house, no issues, go up and down stairs, but right now I'm pretty limited. I can't really go up and down stairs without getting really short of breath. I can't even walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without becoming shortness of, like short of breath."
212,RES,doctor,"OK, um OK, and when did that change happen?"

212,RES,patient,"Uhm no, I think that those are all the questions I had and everything was covered."
212,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm so uh, the next steps for now, I think, will be to, uh start, we'll get a physical exam in and your vital signs and get some investigations. It is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the change changing sputum. The increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath as well, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so, uh, this will require some antibiotics as well and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation."
212,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
213,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
213,RES,patient,"Hi I just want to talk about these, these times when I feel like I'm just I'm suffocating and I just can't breathe. It's pretty scary and I don't know what's going on."
213,RES,doctor,"Yeah, certainly, um, feeling short of breath like that can be quite scary for sure. When, when do these episodes kind of happen? Are they spontaneous? Or can you think of things that you're doing when they when they come on."
213,RES,patient,"Uhm? I, I don't know, it's just like. Uhm? Sometimes, like before interviews, sometimes just kind of random. Uhm, yeah. I can kind of tell when they're about to come on. Uhm? Yeah, I think. It's mostly like job interviews."
213,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had many of those recently?"
213,RES,patient,Job interviews?
213,RES,doctor,Yeah.
213,RES,patient,"I got I got laid off because of the pandemic and now I've been looking for jobs and it's just like it's kind of nerve wracking. But also like I don't know, I'm just worried it could be something else like it's just, yeah, it's like I really just can't breathe, it's so weird."
213,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, it's certainly. It sounds like there's been a lot of stress recently. Certainly plenty for with the pandemic as well. And so when you get short of breath, you you said you have this, you could feel that it's coming on and how long does it last for?"
213,RES,patient,"Like 15 minutes 15, 20 minutes."
213,RES,doctor,Is there anything you do to help it go away?
213,RES,patient,I'll just say go and lie down and close my eyes.
213,RES,doctor,OK. And do you get shorter breath if you walk far distances or exert yourself?

213,RES,doctor,"Potentially, it certainly can't rule out. Inorganic cause meaning something going on, otherwise just yet we might need to do some physical exam and some investigations first, but it certainly could be related to that. With all of the stressors that are going on. And so you had a low mood. Have you had any periods in your life where you felt really energetic, like you didn't need any sleep, you're really talkative, you had all the energy in the world."

213,RES,patient,I can kind of tell it's gonna come on like I have a sense of it and then it just like starts. It suddenly just happens.
213,RES,doctor,"OK. So you you have the heart racing, are there any other symptoms as well?"
213,RES,patient,I don't think so.
213,RES,doctor,"OK, so, uh, we will get an ECG and  I will look at that, but I've been concerned now thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks and so, I guess that would be something that we could discuss more about in regards to like I guess previous traumas and things that and the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage manage stress better."
213,RES,patient,"Sure, thank you."
214,RES,doctor,What can I do for you today?

214,RES,doctor,"Any allergies to food, environmental allergies or any medication allergies to medications?"
214,RES,patient,"Not that I know of, no."
214,RES,doctor,Any medical conditions that run in the family?
214,RES,patient,"Uhm so I think, uh, diabetes, and for my family, but I I I don't have it so and I think that's pretty much about it on my dad's side. On my mom's side and there was someone, like my aunt did have ovarian cancer."
214,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you, I guess have you, I forgot to ask earlier, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?"
214,RES,patient,"Uhm I had a surgery to remove my appendix in my 20s and since then, no. No surgeries or hospitalizations."
214,RES,doctor,"OK.  Alright, and I guess that's all the questions I have for you. You haven't had any difficulties breathing right?"
214,RES,patient,"No,"
214,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Do you OK? And you've had diarrhea for two days. How's your appetite and have you been eating and drinking OK?"
214,RES,patient,"Uhm appetites pretty OK, like I feel like, I've been more hungry, with the carry I feel like I, need to eat more."
214,RES,doctor,"Uhm, It's also important with the diarrhea to drink lots of fluids and to make sure that you're not losing important minerals and you're not losing like sodium or potassium in diarrhea and other things like calcium that could create problems. So, continue to eat well and continue to drink lots of water. I guess so what we'll do is we'll do a COVID swab just to just to check if you have COVID or not. We'll also do a few labs to see how your electrolytes are, do your vitals to see if you have fever, measure your heart rate and do a physical exam and then go from there. And I'll off - I'll talk to my attending as well and we'll come back and discuss the management plan with you."
214,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
215,RES,doctor,How may I help you?
215,RES,patient,"Hi, I've had um I've had a cough for the past um three days and uh I also developed a fever, um I think, so I checked it yesterday night, it was um 38. And uh I just decided to uh come into the walk in clinic just to um just to get myself checked out."
215,RES,doctor,"Yeah certainly, it it sounds like you um have had a fever as well, so uh with the cough, you said that started three days ago, has it been getting uh any better or any worse?"
215,RES,patient,"It's gotten a little bit better, I'd say."
215,RES,doctor,"OK, that's good. Um and and prior to three days ago, um did you have a cough before or was it a new new cough?"
215,RES,patient,It's a new cough.
215,RES,doctor,"Alright, and uh are you bringing up any sputum?"

215,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh so you've had um this cough, a dry cough, a fever, chills, and uh been more tired and and been a little bit more achy these past uh three days. Have you had any other symptoms?"

215,RES,patient,"Yeah, um, yeah I mean, when I I guess I get sick I do get similar symptoms like when I get the cold or the flu, but I usually have like a runny nose um or like a stuffy nose, but that's kind of different this time, a little bit."

215,RES,patient,"Uhm well, I uh I've been hospitalized. I I was kept in the psych unit for a couple of days, um two years ago. But nothing other than that."
215,RES,doctor,OK. Um and it's been stable since then?
215,RES,patient,Yeah.
215,RES,doctor,"OK, great. And I um I just wanted to ask a little bit about um your personal history. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about uh where you're living and and who you're living with."
215,RES,patient,"Uh sure, so I'm living with my um I'm living with my husband and uh we live in an apartment."
215,RES,doctor,"OK, and has he been sick or has anybody you've been around been sick?"
215,RES,patient,"Uhm, he was sick last week but he got better on his own."
215,RES,doctor,"OK, and were were his symptoms similar to yours or or uh or were they different?"
215,RES,patient,"Um they were kind of different, I would say. He just had a um he had a sore throat and uh that kind of lasted for three or four days, and then he just got better."

215,RES,doctor,"And and for how long or for, when did you start smoking? Sorry."
215,RES,patient,"Uh so I've been uh smoking since I was uh 20 years old, so about 30 years ago was when I started."
215,RES,doctor,"OK and and have you could, have you thought of, have you tried to quit before?"
215,RES,patient,"Uhm I did, but then I just didn't. Uh I just went back to it. Um but I'm trying to cut down."
215,RES,doctor,"OK, uh it's good that you've been able to cut down, so congratulations on that. Um and do you drink alcohol?"
215,RES,patient,"Uhm I I do. Uh, I'll drink um sometimes with my friends maybe uh once a month or once in two three months. Um but I haven't been going out with them since the pandemic started, so I haven't had much to drink. I haven't had anything to drink um since the past year."
215,RES,doctor,OK. Um I see. And uh have you had any um history of heart or lung conditions in the family?
215,RES,patient,No.
215,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, and I think that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on on history today before we go ahead on to the physical exam. Uh did you have anything that you wanted to add maybe before um that I forgot to ask about?"
215,RES,patient,Uh no.
215,RES,doctor,"OK, um so we will start with um some investigations, including a a Covid swab today, just because of your uh general symptoms which do overlap with with Covid, um although it could as you mentioned uh be something like the common cold um as well. Um and so we will uh be sure to test for Covid and in the meantime we ask you to self isolate um for for 14 days, um and we will get back the results um as soon as we can, and if your symptoms get worse at any point, um then we will uh act accordingly."
216,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?
216,MSK,patient,"Uh I just came in today I think I broke my leg or something, it's something that was, I heard a snap, I was in um just a dance class um and we have like these long uh dresses, it it was a traditional dance class and my foot uh slipped right onto, it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I I felt right on my, my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down. I knew something was not right and something was broken."
216,MSK,doctor,When did this happen?
216,MSK,patient,Just uh I would say like an hour ago
216,MSK,doctor,"Hour ago, OK. Are you able to bear any weight on it at all?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, not really. I I had to come in the ambulance."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and um if you were to localize this pain, where exactly is it?"
216,MSK,patient,"It's pretty much my whole lower leg is painful, but I think where it looks like it broke is like the middle part of my lower leg."
216,MSK,doctor,"The middle part, OK middle part of your lower leg, so kind of where your shins are?"
216,MSK,patient,Mhmm.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour."
216,MSK,patient,Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing?"
216,MSK,patient,It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is it?"
216,MSK,patient,At 10 for sure.
216,MSK,doctor,"Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better?"
216,MSK,patient,"Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms?"
216,MSK,patient,"Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,How about any numbness or tingling in the area?
216,MSK,patient,"Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes."
216,MSK,doctor,OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area?
216,MSK,patient,"Um no, I I can feel everything in that area."
216,MSK,doctor,OK.
216,MSK,patient,But it's hard to tell like it's just very painful right now.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um how about headaches?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, no headaches."
216,MSK,doctor,Uh any fainting or dizziness.
216,MSK,patient,No.

216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,"Um how about coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, no, nothing like that."

216,MSK,doctor,"No, any changes to your bowel movements?"
216,MSK,patient,"Uh no, not that I've noticed."

216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,Changes to urinary habits?
216,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
216,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, um and are you otherwise healthy?"
216,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I've been pretty healthy, I um don't take any medications regularly, I don't have any medical conditions."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, um just just for like my pregnancies, I had two pregnancies, both of them delivered vaginally, but no issues with that, just after that no hospitalizations or surgeries."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. Um and then um are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
216,MSK,patient,Yep.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Um do you have any allergies?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, not that I know of."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, um and then is there any family history of like musculoskeletal issues?"
216,MSK,patient,Um so my mother has something called osteoporosis.
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, yep."
216,MSK,patient,Um but that's that's all that I can think of.
216,MSK,doctor,How old was she when she was diagnosed with that?
216,MSK,patient,Um probably in her fifties.
216,MSK,doctor,"In her fifties, OK."
216,MSK,patient,Late fifties I would say.
216,MSK,doctor,"Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, I've never, I've never had testing."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,Uh how about autoimmune conditions?
216,MSK,patient,"Uh no, not that I know of."
216,MSK,doctor,Any cancers?
216,MSK,patient,"Uh, I think one of my aunts has uh ovarian cancer."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, um how old was she when she was diagnosed with that?"
216,MSK,patient,"Um like pretty uh recently, so probably like in her sixties."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, um and then have you been in touch with anyone sick recently?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, have you done any travel recently?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,OK. Um those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own or anything you wanted to add before we move to the physical exam component?
216,MSK,patient,"No, I just want to get this fixed as soon as possible."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best."
216,MSK,patient,Thank you.
216,MSK,doctor,"Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left?"
216,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area?"
216,MSK,patient,"Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area?"
216,MSK,patient,No.
216,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer?"
216,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg?"
216,MSK,patient,"No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK?"
216,MSK,patient,"That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much."
216,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, no worries."
217,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
217,RES,patient,"This afternoon, I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, when did it start?"
217,RES,patient,So I think it's a it started around three months ago and I believe it's just been getting worse.
217,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, how often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?"
217,RES,patient,"I feel it like a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or at at night when I go outside at night, my chest feels a little tight too at the same time."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, and how long does it last?"
217,RES,patient,I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.
217,RES,doctor,"OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?"
217,RES,patient,"Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?"
217,RES,patient,I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.
217,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?"
217,RES,patient,"It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens."
217,RES,doctor,"Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?"
217,RES,patient,"I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that?"
217,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say so."
217,RES,doctor,And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?
217,RES,patient,"No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything."
217,RES,doctor,"OK so no sputum or phlegm, no? OK, do you ever feel wheezy?"
217,RES,patient,"I I I do hear like a like a weird sound when I breathe out sometimes, I I think it might be wheeziness."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Do you have a sore throat?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh, no I don't have a sore throat, no."
217,RES,doctor,"No? Um, how about a runny nose or stuffy nose?"
217,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
217,RES,doctor,Any changes in your smell?
217,RES,patient,"No, no changes in my smell, no."
217,RES,doctor,OK. How about hearing?
217,RES,patient,"Uh, no hearing is fine."

217,RES,doctor,"OK, so you woke up feeling chilly, any night sweats?"
217,RES,patient,Uh no.
217,RES,doctor,"OK, any weight loss?"
217,RES,patient,No no.
217,RES,doctor,How about changes in your skin? Like have you noticed a rash anywhere?
217,RES,patient,"Uh, not that I've really noticed no, no rashes."
217,RES,doctor,OK and any chest pain at all?
217,RES,patient,"No, just sometimes when I I'm coughing a lot I feel a little bit of just tension and heaviness in there. But that's just when I'm like really coughing a lot."
217,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK, and any any feelings like your heart's racing?"
217,RES,patient,Nope.
217,RES,doctor,No? OK. And how about swelling? Have you noticed swelling anywhere in your body?
217,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
217,RES,doctor,"No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?"
217,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that. I think it's mainly just worse if I go out in the cold or I'm like running around, doing more activities."
217,RES,doctor,Does it ever wake you up at night?
217,RES,patient,No never.
217,RES,doctor,OK and any nausea or vomiting?

217,RES,doctor,"OK, good are you otherwise healthy?"
217,RES,patient,"Yeah, I don't have any other condition, I I do remember my doctors saying I have hay fever before, but that's about it."
217,RES,doctor,When was that?
217,RES,patient,I think that was like more than three years ago.
217,RES,doctor,"OK, um, any recent surgeries?"
217,RES,patient,No.
217,RES,doctor,No? Are you on any medications?
217,RES,patient,"I just take some Tylenol sometimes for the like Tylenol cold, sometimes for the symptoms. I don't think it has really helped."
217,RES,doctor,"No? OK, do you have any allergies? Not just to medications, but to anything else?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh just like hay fever but nothing, nothing else that I can think of, no."
217,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
217,RES,patient,"As far as I know, yeah everything's up to date."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, any family history of lung conditions?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh, don't think so. My sister, I think she they were saying she might have asthma and she also has eczema. No one else in the family has any other conditions."
217,RES,doctor,"Not not even like heart conditions, cancer?"
217,RES,patient,"No, uh no, not that I know."

217,RES,patient,No.
217,RES,doctor,"No, OK, and any travel recently?"
217,RES,patient,"No, I've been here in Ontario."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, and where do you live?"
217,RES,patient,"So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago."
217,RES,doctor,"Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night."
217,RES,doctor,"Yeah, any any pets?"
217,RES,patient,"Oh no, I don't have any pets."
217,RES,doctor,OK and and do you smoke?

217,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um, and is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh, so no, I think that that was all like just the shortness of breath was scaring me a lot. But yeah, just the coughing, but other than that I just want to know what's going on."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right?"
217,RES,patient,"No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe?"
217,RES,doctor,"Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?"
217,RES,patient,"Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months."
217,RES,doctor,OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?
217,RES,patient,"No, I don't recall having any of that done."
217,RES,doctor,"OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?"
217,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good."
217,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then."
217,RES,patient,"Alright, thank you."
217,RES,doctor,Take care.
217,RES,patient,You too.

220,MSK,doctor,"No, OK now I am going to get you to um extend your wrist."
220,MSK,patient,OK.
220,MSK,doctor,And then keep your elbow in full extension as well. Does that hurt?
220,MSK,patient,"Uh it does, yeah."
220,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, OK, how about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh it does, yeah that hurts as well."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about when you flex your elbow?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh no, that that doesn't cause any pain."
220,MSK,doctor,OK. How about when you extend your shoulder all the way up?
220,MSK,patient,"No, nothing there, that feels fine."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then flexing your uh, or sorry abducting your shoulder?"
220,MSK,patient,That feels normal.
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, and then how about when you pronate and supinate your forearms?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh, pronation um?"
220,MSK,doctor,So like twist your um arm inwards so that your palm is facing the floor.
220,MSK,patient,"No, that doesn't really cause any pain, pronation and supination."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright. Um alright, and then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"
220,MSK,patient,Um I'm uh healthy.
220,MSK,doctor,"You're healthy, OK. And then UM do you have, have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"
220,MSK,patient,"I had a surgery for um a C-section for uh my, my son, um but that's that's it."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, and um how long ago was that?"
220,MSK,patient,That was about uh 17 years ago.
220,MSK,doctor,OK. And was that an emergency C-section?
220,MSK,patient,"Uh no, it was not."
220,MSK,doctor,OK um and then are you on any medications?
220,MSK,patient,"Um no, I've just been taking uh Tylenol and Advil um for the pain."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright um immunizations wise, are you up to date?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh I I am, yes."
220,MSK,doctor,OK. Do you have any allergies?
220,MSK,patient,Uh no allergies.
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, family history of any uh skeletal or muscular um issues?"
220,MSK,patient,"Um no, nothing like that in the family."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, neurological issues in the family?"
220,MSK,patient,Um no neurological issues in the family.
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about um autoimmune conditions?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh no, nothing like that."
220,MSK,doctor,OK and then um do you smoke?
220,MSK,patient,"Uh no, I haven't smoked before."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh do you do um marijuana."
220,MSK,patient,"No, I I don't use that."
220,MSK,doctor,OK. Um Alcohol?
220,MSK,patient,"Um uh yeah, I'll have a glass of wine every once in awhile, but maybe just one, one a week."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you been around sick contacts recently?"
220,MSK,patient,"Um no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick."
220,MSK,doctor,OK. Any recent travel?
220,MSK,patient,"Uh nope, I've been at home."
220,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?"
220,MSK,patient,"Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow."
220,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?"
220,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you."
220,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, no worries."
221,RES,doctor,What brings you all in today?
221,RES,patient,"Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don’t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though."
221,RES,doctor,Oh OK.
221,RES,patient,"Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something."
221,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days."
221,RES,patient,Mhm.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, OK so let's focus on the cough."
221,RES,patient,"It’s Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry."
221,RES,doctor,"Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
221,RES,patient,"Uh I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Yeah he yeah, its just like little cough."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,"No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"
221,RES,patient,"No, no, not that I've noticed."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, how about short of breath?"
221,RES,patient,"Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?"
221,RES,patient,Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"
221,RES,patient,"Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud."
221,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"
221,RES,patient,"Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold."
221,RES,doctor,OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?
221,RES,patient,"I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"
221,RES,patient,"No, I don't think so."
221,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?"
221,RES,patient,Mm I don't think so.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"
221,RES,patient,"I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"
221,RES,patient,Maybe a bit of like a look at runny nose.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"
221,RES,patient,"He, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, how about vision or hearing?"
221,RES,patient,I think those are fine.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"
221,RES,patient,"No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
221,RES,doctor,Any changes in his bowel movements. Pardon?
221,RES,patient,Um sorry no changes.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"
221,RES,patient,No
221,RES,doctor,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, any changes in his urine?"
221,RES,patient,"I haven’t really been looking, but I don't think so."
221,RES,doctor,Any dizziness or fainting spells?
221,RES,patient,"No, just like fatigue."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, any confusion or memory loss?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?
221,RES,patient,"Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm."
221,RES,patient,"Exactly, like nothing."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?"
221,RES,patient,Yeah totally.
221,RES,doctor,"OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"
221,RES,patient,"No, no, like everything is things really good."
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now?"
221,RES,patient,Yeah totally.
221,RES,doctor,"OK. Any, does he have any allergies?"
221,RES,patient,"Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing."
221,RES,doctor,Is he up to date with all his immunizations?
221,RES,patient,Yeah.
221,RES,doctor,"Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"
221,RES,patient,Uh no everyone is really healthy.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live?"
221,RES,patient,"Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here."
221,RES,doctor,"OK and, is she healthy?"
221,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy."
221,RES,doctor,"OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?"
221,RES,patient,"Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say."
221,RES,doctor,OK.
221,RES,patient,But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything.
221,RES,doctor,"OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"
221,RES,patient,No.
221,RES,doctor,"No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"
221,RES,patient,"I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure."
221,RES,doctor,Yeah for
221,RES,patient,"yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead,"
221,RES,doctor,No go ahead.
221,RES,patient,I’m just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.
221,RES,doctor,"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?"
221,RES,patient,"Yeah, sounds good."
221,RES,doctor,"OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection."
221,RES,patient,"OK yeah, that's good to know."
221,RES,doctor,"Alright, sounds great. Have a good day."
221,RES,patient,You too thanks.
222,RES,doctor,So I understand you're having some chest tightness?
222,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?"
222,RES,patient,I think it's staying the same.
222,RES,doctor,"OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?"
222,RES,patient,"No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady."
222,RES,doctor,"OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?"
222,RES,patient,Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.
222,RES,doctor,"OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?"
222,RES,patient,"No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?"
222,RES,patient,"Uh, no I can't say that I did."
222,RES,doctor,"Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?"
222,RES,patient,"Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?"
222,RES,patient,Kind of just all over.
222,RES,doctor,"OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?"
222,RES,patient,"Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?"
222,RES,patient,Exactly.
222,RES,doctor,OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?
222,RES,patient,"Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, any fevers?"
222,RES,patient,"No, can't say that, no."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?"
222,RES,patient,No.
222,RES,doctor,Any chills?
222,RES,patient,No.
222,RES,doctor,Any unexplained weight loss at all?
222,RES,patient,Nope.
222,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?"
222,RES,patient,"Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?"
222,RES,patient,"Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?"
222,RES,patient,"Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one."
222,RES,doctor,OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?
222,RES,patient,"No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?"
222,RES,patient,"Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?"
222,RES,patient,"Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?"
222,RES,patient,"I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah."
222,RES,doctor,"So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?"
222,RES,patient,"Exactly, yeah."
222,RES,doctor,"OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?"
222,RES,patient,"Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?"
222,RES,patient,"Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol."
222,RES,doctor,Yeah.
222,RES,patient,"That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril."
222,RES,doctor,Yep.
222,RES,patient,"And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often."
222,RES,doctor,"OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?"
222,RES,patient,"No, no."
222,RES,doctor,OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?
222,RES,patient,"No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?"
222,RES,patient,"No, never."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?"
222,RES,patient,"Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?"
222,RES,patient,"Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that."
222,RES,doctor,"OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?"
222,RES,patient,Exactly.
222,RES,doctor,"OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much."
222,RES,patient,"Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough."
222,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?"
222,RES,patient,"Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart."
222,RES,doctor,"No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?"
222,RES,patient,"Sounds great, thank you."
222,RES,doctor,"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment."
222,RES,patient,Thank you.
223,RES,doctor,So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?
223,RES,patient,"Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?"
223,RES,patient,Yeah.
223,RES,doctor,"OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?"
223,RES,patient,"It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?"
223,RES,patient,"No, this one, this one's pretty small."
223,RES,doctor,"This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?"
223,RES,patient,"I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?"
223,RES,patient,"No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?"
223,RES,patient,No.
223,RES,doctor,Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?
223,RES,patient,"No, no, I've been fine."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?"
223,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else."
223,RES,doctor,That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?
223,RES,patient,"Uh no, I didn't, no."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?"
223,RES,patient,Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.
223,RES,doctor,"OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?"
223,RES,patient,We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.
223,RES,doctor,"OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?"
223,RES,patient,"No, no. I've been pretty healthy."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?"
223,RES,patient,Uh just for my cholesterol.
223,RES,doctor,"OK, are you taking and medications for that?"
223,RES,patient,"Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one."
223,RES,doctor,"OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?"
223,RES,patient,Uh no.
223,RES,doctor,So no drug allergies?
223,RES,patient,No.
223,RES,doctor,"OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?"
223,RES,patient,"Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked."
223,RES,doctor,OK. So no headaches?
223,RES,patient,No.
223,RES,doctor,Nothing like that?
223,RES,patient,Nothing like that.
223,RES,doctor,"OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?"
223,RES,patient,"No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out."
223,RES,doctor,"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?"
223,RES,patient,"Great, thanks."
223,RES,doctor,Thanks Jean.
224,RES,doctor,Do you want to tell me what brought you in today?
224,RES,patient,"Yeah, so for the past two days I I've I've noticed that I can't smell things as well, as I used to be able to smell them and I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's covid."
224,RES,doctor,OK. You said for a couple days?
224,RES,patient,"Yes, for two days."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
224,RES,patient,"No, no, nothing like this."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?"
224,RES,patient,"The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?"
224,RES,patient,"It's been pretty consistent, yeah."
224,RES,doctor,OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?
224,RES,patient,Yes.
224,RES,doctor,"And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum? Any blood? Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?"
224,RES,patient,It's dry.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?"
224,RES,patient,The dry cough? Um it's been pretty consistent as well.
224,RES,doctor,"OK is there, have you done anything to try to make it better? Have you taken any over the counter medications or?"
224,RES,patient,"No, I haven't tried anything."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fevers?"
224,RES,patient,"Fevers, no fevers."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, any difficulty breathing?"
224,RES,patient,No.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, any headaches?"
224,RES,patient,"Um no, no headaches."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, any sore throat?"
224,RES,patient,No.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, any chills or night sweats?"
224,RES,patient,No.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, any muscle ache or general weakness?"
224,RES,patient,Uh no.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, so generally it seems like you're pretty well other than this loss of taste slash smell and the dry cough that correct,"
224,RES,patient,Yes.
224,RES,doctor,OK and then recently have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?
224,RES,patient,"Um no not that I can remember or yeah, not that I can remember."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, have you traveled anywhere?"
224,RES,patient,"Um I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago. I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that I don't see where else I could have gotten this from."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, was that hiking somewhere close by?"
224,RES,patient,"Yeah, it was like half an hour from where we are."
224,RES,doctor,OK. Are your immunizations up to date?
224,RES,patient,Yes.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it? It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?"
224,RES,patient,No.
224,RES,doctor,OK. Have you had any chest pain? Thats the other thing . I'm not sure if I asked you .
224,RES,patient,No no chest pain.
224,RES,doctor,"OK. And in terms of your general health, do you? Do you have any chronic conditions that you live with?"
224,RES,patient,Um no no.
224,RES,doctor,Do you take any medications?
224,RES,patient,No.

224,RES,patient,Um no.
224,RES,doctor,"OK, do you read along with a partner or roommate?"
224,RES,patient,I live with my parents and my younger sibling.
224,RES,doctor,OK. And is that in town here?
224,RES,patient,"Yes, yeah."
224,RES,doctor,"OK. And in general, do you eat a healthy diet? Do you exercise?"
224,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so."

224,RES,doctor,"OK, and how is that going?"
224,RES,patient,"Pretty good, yeah, we're doing things online now."
224,RES,doctor,So you haven't really been out of the house?
224,RES,patient,No.
224,RES,doctor,"OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms."
224,RES,patient,Yeah.
224,RES,doctor,"Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?"
224,RES,patient,"No, uh thank you so much."
224,RES,doctor,"OK, well thanks for coming in today. Will definitely get you taken care of shortly."
224,RES,patient,Thank you.
224,RES,doctor,K thanks.
225,MSK,doctor,What brings in here today?
225,MSK,patient,"Hi there, I've just last night I was, I went for a run and I twisted my ankle. I think I stepped on something and it it really hurts."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and so when did you have the injury?"
225,MSK,patient,It was just yesterday.
225,MSK,doctor,OK.
225,MSK,patient,Yeah it was just just yesterday that it happened.
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you remember if you twisted it so you twisted your ankle, like did did it twist inwards or outwards?"
225,MSK,patient,"Inwards yeah, I feel like I inverted my ankle."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK. And, so since then, were you able to stand up and or were you not able to bear any weight?"
225,MSK,patient,"No, I was able to, uh, kind of finish the I I I just finished the walk. I was able to walk home 'cause it didn't hurt that bad immediately. It was a bit painful, but the pain really started a few hours later and has been pretty much constant ever since."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK so it kind of got worse over time over the last day?"
225,MSK,patient,Yeah.
225,MSK,doctor,"And do you notice any kind of bruising, redness, swelling, any skin changes?"

225,MSK,patient,Dull and achy.
225,MSK,doctor,OK. OK. And has this happened to you in your ankle before?
225,MSK,patient,"I'm I, I feel like I've maybe I I've done something like this when I was younger, maybe playing basketball or something like this when I was a kid, I twisted my ankle before."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does this pain just stay, where's the pain exactly on the right side of your ankle or on your left, like interior side?"
225,MSK,patient,It's on the right kind of outside of the ankle.
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and which ankle is this just to clarify?"
225,MSK,patient,On the right ankle.
225,MSK,doctor,OK so so it hurts on the right side of the right ankle.
225,MSK,patient,"Yeah, exactly."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does the pain radiate or move anywhere in your feet?"
225,MSK,patient,"I can kind of feel it around on the the sole of my foot as well, but mostly on the outside though."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?"
225,MSK,patient,"Alright, it gets worse really to if if I move my ankle or if I'm standing on it."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and anything that makes it better?"
225,MSK,patient,"Alright, just if I rest and avoid moving it."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you notice any fevers or chills?"

225,MSK,doctor,"OK, any weakness in your right right extremities or any kind of numbness or tingling sensation?"
225,MSK,patient,No numbness or tingling and no muscle weakness either.
225,MSK,doctor,"Ok, right. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
225,MSK,patient,"I'm uh, I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquinolone as an antibiotic."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's two months ago. OK. And any medications that you're on currently?"
225,MSK,patient,I I take a Vitamin D and some other vitamins too. Vitamin A as well I guess that just helps my my skin and and then the vitamin D for my my bones.
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, any allergies to medications or any environmental issues?"
225,MSK,patient,"No allergies, no."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?"
225,MSK,patient,No.
225,MSK,doctor,"OK. Any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions. Anything that you know of?"
225,MSK,patient,"My grandparents have arthritis, so and my like my dad had had gout before."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do your grandparents have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, do you know?"
225,MSK,patient,I think osteo yeah osteoarthritis.
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and do you currently work?"
225,MSK,patient,"I do, yeah, I work as a software engineer."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what's your living situation like currently?"
225,MSK,patient,Right now I'm actually just living alone in a in an apartment.
225,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and do you smoke at all?"
225,MSK,patient,"No, never I can't with the with all this like training for yeah at the race and stuff like that."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that before?"
225,MSK,patient,"No, I've never used anything like that in the past."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about alcohol?"
225,MSK,patient,"Uh rarely I'll have maybe a glass of wine like once every couple of months, but it's pretty infrequent."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so I just have a few questions. Right now over your right ankle, do you have, so you mentioned you don't have any swelling, but do you notice any kind of redness or warmth at all?"
225,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and if you press down on your ankle, does it hurt a lot?"
225,MSK,patient,"Uh a little bit of pain now that right, uh, like outside, but it's not uh, it doesn't hurt that bad. Yeah, I'll say no."
225,MSK,doctor,"OK, and if you kind of, uh, are you able to move your ankle at all?"
225,MSK,patient,"I can, yeah I can move it around a little bit. I'm trying to avoid that though, just because it it does hurt, but I can move it around."
225,MSK,doctor,OK. And are you able to stand up and walk or are you not able to do that right now?
225,MSK,patient,"I can, yeah, just for short periods of time 'cause it's just 'cause of the pain, but I can walk on it."
225,MSK,doctor,"Ok, yeah, so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done to make sure there is no fracture. Most likely though, it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain uh, due to you inverting your ankle the other day. Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well. However, if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain, we might also require you to get an X Ray of the right foot and ankle, as well as just your lower leg. So yeah, we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an X Ray."
225,MSK,patient,"OK, that sounds good, thank you."
225,MSK,doctor,"Alright, take care bye."
226,RES,doctor,I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department.
226,RES,patient,So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, where is the pain located?"
226,RES,patient,I would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did this pain start?"
226,RES,patient,"So I think it started just around 2 hours ago. I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful."
226,RES,doctor,"OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy."
226,RES,patient,I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse?"
226,RES,patient,"If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest?"
226,RES,patient,"No, I would say just on the left side."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better?"
226,RES,patient,I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms?"
226,RES,patient,"Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, um has anything like this ever happened to you before?"
226,RES,patient,"No, no. I mean, I've never had any pain in my chest before."
226,RES,doctor,"OK are you, did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike?"
226,RES,patient,"No, I got right back up. I just just had the pain."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, so any injuries to the head?"
226,RES,patient,No.
226,RES,doctor,OK.
226,RES,patient,That's fine. I was wearing a helmet.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, excellent and any headache right now?"
226,RES,patient,No.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any fever chills?"
226,RES,patient,"No, I feel I'm fine."
226,RES,doctor,Any nausea or vomiting?
226,RES,patient,Nope.
226,RES,doctor,Do you feel as though your heart's racing?
226,RES,patient,I would say like in the last hour a little bit more so than usual.
226,RES,doctor,OK. Any skin changes or or rashes you've noticed?
226,RES,patient,"Besides, just I got some scrapes here and there on my hands, but nothing else."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you have a cough?"
226,RES,patient,Nope.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and any recent infections?"
226,RES,patient,"No, I've been pretty pretty healthy recently. No, no cough or no infections."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, any dizziness?"
226,RES,patient,Um no.
226,RES,doctor,"Alright, and I know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands, but any other injuries?"
226,RES,patient,"Oh no, I I think I got a pretty lucky."
226,RES,doctor,"Oh, OK. And any alcohol or drug intake prior to falling off your bike?"
226,RES,patient,"Oh no, no, I was completely sober. No no drugs or alcohol."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed?"
226,RES,patient,Um no nothing like that.
226,RES,doctor,"Alright, and, when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?"
226,RES,patient,"I just had some cereal and, um, just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and how many hours ago was that?"
226,RES,patient,I would say around 3 hours ago.
226,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"
226,RES,patient,"Uh, not other than just a hay fever, but nothing nothing else. I have like a lot of allergies."
226,RES,doctor,Any allergies to medications?
226,RES,patient,"Oh, just sometimes when I take like a nasal spray I think I might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines I think I get some allergies from them."
226,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, and any hospitalizations?"
226,RES,patient,"No, never."
226,RES,doctor,Any surgeries?
226,RES,patient,Nope.
226,RES,doctor,OK. Anybody in the family who have any illnesses?
226,RES,patient,Just my father. He has type 2 diabetes but nothing else.
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and how do you support yourself currently financially?"
226,RES,patient,"Oh so I work just as like a mechanic just in the city and currently I just have myself to support. I live alone in an apartment, so I'm doing fairly well."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you smoke?"
226,RES,patient,"I smoke around like I'd say 2 and a half to 3 packs per day. I know it's. Yeah, I have tried quitting before, but I would say I've been smoking since I was 18."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you smoke marijuana?"
226,RES,patient,"No, no, no marijuana, no other drugs."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?"
226,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's just like sometimes on the weekend. I'll just have a beer or two while watching the game, but not nothing regular."
226,RES,doctor,"OK, thank you."
227,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
227,MSK,patient,"I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK and when, when did this pain start?"
227,MSK,patient,"It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain?"
227,MSK,patient,Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away."
227,MSK,patient,"I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though."
227,MSK,doctor,"Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like."
227,MSK,patient,Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back?"
227,MSK,patient,"It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else?"
227,MSK,patient,"Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key?"
227,MSK,patient,It's more achy.
227,MSK,doctor,OK.
227,MSK,patient,But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse?"
227,MSK,patient,"Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you done anything that's made it better?"
227,MSK,patient,"I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then."
227,MSK,patient,Yeah.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10."
227,MSK,patient,"Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym?"
227,MSK,patient,"Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder?"
227,MSK,patient,Mmmm
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder?"
227,MSK,patient,Um no not that I know of.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you had any fevers or chills?"
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,Have you had any night sweats?
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you had any skin rashes or or skin changes?"
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,OK so even over the area you haven't noticed any redness or like soft tissue swelling?
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,OK. Have you had any chest pain?
227,MSK,patient,Nope.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about any shortness of breath?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, not that I've noticed."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, have you had pains and any other joints?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, just my shoulder."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK And. Um, Have you had any recent infections or or symptoms such as like a runny nose or sore throat or even a cough?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?"
227,MSK,patient,Um nope.
227,MSK,doctor,OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side?
227,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night?"
227,MSK,patient,Yup.
227,MSK,doctor,OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm?
227,MSK,patient,"Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK,  And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back?"
227,MSK,patient,It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased?"
227,MSK,patient,Mmm
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't felt any of that."
227,MSK,doctor,OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea?
227,MSK,patient,"Nope, nothing like that."
227,MSK,doctor,Have you had any abdominal pain?
227,MSK,patient,Nope.
227,MSK,doctor,And have you had any urinary problems?
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
227,MSK,patient,"Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications?"
227,MSK,patient,No.
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, do you take any medications regularly?"
227,MSK,patient,"Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently, like who you're living with, and whereabouts?"
227,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so I'm living with with my wife in a small condominium in downtown."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, and are you working currently?"
227,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I'm working as a real estate agent."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh, and do you drink alcohol?"
227,MSK,patient,"Rarely just on some occasions, but not regularly."
227,MSK,doctor,No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis?
227,MSK,patient,"No, I've never smoked."
227,MSK,doctor,Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past?
227,MSK,patient,Nope
227,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction."
227,MSK,patient,"Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you?"
227,MSK,patient,"yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful."
227,MSK,doctor,OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain?
227,MSK,patient,"Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation?"
227,MSK,patient,"Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot?"
227,MSK,patient,"No, I think that's it."
227,MSK,doctor,"OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder."
227,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you."
228,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
228,RES,patient,"So I've been having just a worsening breathlessness. I've been also having a cough, and I think I might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?"
228,RES,patient,Yeah.
228,RES,doctor,OK and then when did the cough start?
228,RES,patient,"I'd say around the same time the breathlessness started, so around six weeks."
228,RES,doctor,OK. And then the fever?
228,RES,patient,The fever I've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks. I would say two to three weeks.
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK um and do you, how often are you having this breathlessness?"
228,RES,patient,"Um I would say it's pretty much there most of the time. It sometimes gets worse when I'm exerting myself, but I think just baseline, I feel like I've been able to breathe less heavily than before."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?"
228,RES,patient,"Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness, would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling, like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast?"
228,RES,patient,"I think it's more I just can't seem to take like deep breaths. And then when I get breathless, I I really try to take a deep breath but I just can't find myself catching my breath at that time. So it's just more not being able to catch my breath."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?"
228,RES,patient,"Uh, not really, I think it's sometimes moving around too much, but like nothing, nothing really causes it."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms?"
228,RES,patient,Oh I'm not sure I I don't think there was any triggers.
228,RES,doctor,"OK, has anyone around you been sick?"
228,RES,patient,So there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks.
228,RES,doctor,OK.
228,RES,patient,So yeah.
228,RES,doctor,So they have similar symptoms to you as well then?
228,RES,patient,"Yeah, some of them like don't really have the shortness of breath and it's just like a cough."
228,RES,doctor,OK.
228,RES,patient,"But yeah, there are some of them also have some shortness of breath."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?"
228,RES,patient,So I actually came to Canada one year ago. I'm originally from India and I I'm I came here to study.
228,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, um alright. If you were to rate your breathlessness from one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?"
228,RES,patient,"It can get pretty bad. Like I I would say up to an 8 sometimes, maybe a couple times a week."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you ever experienced this before?"
228,RES,patient,"No, this is like the first time I'm having this issue."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you feel like it's getting worse, better, has it changed since you started having these symptoms?"
228,RES,patient,I think it's getting worse and that's why I was getting a bit scared and I came here.
228,RES,doctor,"OK. Yeah, that was a good call and have you had any changes to your smell recently?"
228,RES,patient,"No, no changes to smell."
228,RES,doctor,Any anything like a runny nose or stuffy nose?
228,RES,patient,"Uh, no, not really, no."
228,RES,doctor,"No? OK, how about a sore throat?"
228,RES,patient,"No, no sore throat."

228,RES,patient,Nope.

228,RES,patient,Nope.
228,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned fever and some night sweats. How often are you getting these night sweats and do they feel like chills?"
228,RES,patient,"I think in the last two weeks I've been getting it more frequently, like I would say every other night I I feel, I would feel chilly at one point and then I'll break out into night sweats or have to take off my blanket. I think I measured it once or twice over the week and it did show like a fever of 102."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. OK, and any changes to your skin like rashes?"
228,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."

228,RES,doctor,"OK yeah, and the coughing, are you coughing up any blood?"
228,RES,patient,"Uh, I don't think so. Sometimes, like when I cough up like sputum, there is like a little bit of pink, pink tinged sputum as well. Sometimes it's like brownish in color and sometimes it's green, but I haven't actually coughed up any blood."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, um and you said there's some sputum like pink tinged sputum. How much sputum would you say you cough up every time you cough?"
228,RES,patient,Maybe like a like a spoonful I would say.
228,RES,doctor,OK. And do you ever feel like you're wheezing?
228,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I I don't think so. I I don't really notice any noises when I'm breathing."
228,RES,doctor,"OK. And, alright, so any chest pain?"

228,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?"
228,RES,patient,"Um I think when I was back in India a couple years ago, they did give me some antibiotics for like a chest infection, but I couldn't really afford the medications and didn't take them. I didn't finish the course, but other than that, nothing else."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, did they mention what type of chest infection it could've been?"
228,RES,patient,"No, I don't really remember. I think it was some kind of pneumonia."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Are you on any medications?"
228,RES,patient,"Just uh I take Tylenol sometimes, like it hasn't really been helping."
228,RES,doctor,"OK. And, are you allergic to anything?"
228,RES,patient,"No, not that I know."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"

228,RES,patient,"Yeah, so three of them actually have like, two of them have a cough and one of them has some shortness of breath as well."
228,RES,doctor,OK. And have they been to a doctor? Have they been investigated? Were they ever given a diagnosis?
228,RES,patient,"No, not that I know of. I think I might be the first one who actually went to a doctor."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Um, do you smoke?"
228,RES,patient,I smoke like I would say like 5 cigarettes a day.
228,RES,doctor,"OK, how long have you been smoking for?"
228,RES,patient,Around 10 years.
228,RES,doctor,"OK, that's, it's been a while then. Um, and do you do you drink alcohol?"
228,RES,patient,"No, I I don't drink and I don't do any drugs either."
228,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Are you sexually active?"
228,RES,patient,"Not currently, no."
228,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Have you ever had unprotected sex?"
228,RES,patient,No.
228,RES,doctor,"No?, OK. OK, um, did you have any questions or concerns? Anything you wanted to discuss that I hadn't asked you about?"
228,RES,patient,"Um, so yeah, this is just like my first time visiting a doctor in this country and like I was just very scared that it might be something serious, so just wanted to know what it can be."
228,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?"
228,RES,patient,That sounds good. Thank you.
229,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?
229,MSK,patient,"Hi, I've I've had um this pain in my left knee that's been going on now for the last uh three or four months um but it's gotten a bit a bit worse, it used to only really bug me while I was doing activity, and now its started to uh hurt even more um afterwards as well, so I'm getting the pain at at rest. and so I wanted to come and get that checked out."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, for sure. Um and you said it started a few weeks ago?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh well, I think it first started a few months ago, but in the past couple of weeks it has started to um kinda like last longer and and happen at rest as well."
229,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, and so does anything make it worse or better? I assume doing any sort of physical activity makes it worse and rest makes it better, but how about anything other than that?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uhm not really, yeah, it's mostly just the the activity, if I'm going upstairs or um downstairs or uh during running is really where it hurts the most and that's what's bugged me the um yeah, the most, running."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say sharp, dull, achy, crampy?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh it's a sharp pain, uh almost like every time my foot hits the ground I get like a sharp stabbing pain and while I'm at at rest it feels a bit more dull, while, yeah, yeah while I'm at rest."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is this pain?"
229,MSK,patient,A six.
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh I did have something similar like many years ago. I used to be a rower uh in undergrad and I got some similar pains before, and I mean with some stretching and um other I don't know kind of strengthening stuff, it it kind of helped but I didn't go see anybody for it at that time because it it kind of went away after a little while,"
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, um and you said you were, are you still rowing?"
229,MSK,patient,"No, no, the only activity that I'm doing now is is running."
229,MSK,doctor,"Running, OK and from when it started to now, in the past couple of weeks has it changed like dramatically, um is it affecting your day to day life?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh a little bit, yeah, like even now, just walking I can I can feel it. Um the pain's not as severe but like as when I'm running but I can, I'm starting to notice it uh daily."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, and um are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any um symptoms like fevers or chills?"
229,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."

229,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as um yeah, just if you could palpate just at the center of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?"
229,MSK,patient,"No pain over the kneecap, that feels fine."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK. How about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?"

229,MSK,doctor,Above the joint line?
229,MSK,patient,Yeah.
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?"
229,MSK,patient,"That feels OK, no pain in the muscles."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about like the patellar tendon?"
229,MSK,patient,Uh no pain there.
229,MSK,doctor,"OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah, no pain there."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah, I am."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?"
229,MSK,patient,"It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt?"
229,MSK,patient,"Um yeah, that hurts too."
229,MSK,doctor,"That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt?"
229,MSK,patient,"Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?"
229,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling."
229,MSK,patient,"OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?"
229,MSK,patient,Yep.
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible."
229,MSK,patient,"Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?"
229,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, thank you so much."
229,MSK,doctor,"OK yeah, no worries."

Um but um it'll be important to get uh some imaging of your of your lungs um to assess whether or not there's a pulmonary embolism um uh because that would be one of the more um life threatening, or potentially um complicating uh causes of what's going on right now."
231,RES,patient,Sure.

232,RES,doctor,"OK, and what do you do for, do you work?"
232,RES,patient,"Yeah, currently I'm working from home. I'm an accounting clerk."
232,RES,doctor,"Alright, and do you smoke at all or did you smoke in the past?"
232,RES,patient,"Yeah, I I, I do smoke but I've cut down significantly in the past few years. I currently only smoke, uh, probably two or three cigarettes a day. I was, I was smoking like almost a pack a day a few years back."
232,RES,doctor,"Oh, that's great. It's great that you're trying to cut down. Do you intend on getting the getting down the smoking even further?"
232,RES,patient,"Yeah, that's that's the plan. If I can do that, hopefully by the end of this year, that would be great."

232,RES,doctor,Any alcohol?
232,RES,patient,"Alcohol, just, uh, probably just on the weekends or have a couple of beers."
232,RES,doctor,"OK alright, uhm. So, I guess from the symptoms that you've described, it sounds like you likely have a condition called acute rhinosinusitis where you have inflammation of the sinuses in your face and potentially some inflammation in your nose as well, and often it's caused by a virus and it usually gets better in a couple of weeks. And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there."
232,RES,patient,"Great sounds good, thank you."
232,RES,doctor,"Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do."

235,RES,doctor,"OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking."
235,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind."
235,RES,doctor,"OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?"
235,RES,patient,"Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going."
235,RES,doctor,"OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications."
235,RES,patient,"OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you."
235,RES,doctor,Welcome.
236,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?

So today we will do a COVID swab test for you today, as a lot of the symptoms overlap and you will receive the result in the next one to two days and be contacted by public health for further instructions.

237,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
237,MSK,patient,"I just came in here today, I usually don't come to the doctor that much unless I absolutely need it. Five days ago I started having this pain and swelling in my right knee. So and at first I thought it was just like my arthritis acting up but it's been getting more swollen and painful than usual, so I just wanted to come in and check it out."
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, so when did you first notice that this pain, like when did it get more swollen and painful than usual?"
237,MSK,patient,So like I would say around 5 days ago it started getting more and usually I do get pain in some of my joints but I I don't really get swelling so that was a bit different.
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is the joint hot as well, or is there a temperature change?"
237,MSK,patient,"It is, it does feel like if I touch the joint it does feel a bit warmer than the surrounding areas."

237,MSK,patient,"Uhm, I don't think so, no."
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, so you're feeling it just in the knee and you said moving the knees is painful. Is there anything else that makes the pain worse?"
237,MSK,patient,"Uhm, not really like resting it definitely helps, yeah, but I just have to keep it a bit immobilized."
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is there anything that that makes the pain better that you've tried like maybe medications or any ice packs or anything like that?"

237,MSK,doctor,"OK. And. And um. OK, is the pain worse at any particular time of the day, like do you have morning stiffness?"
237,MSK,patient,"Yeah, usually with my normal this arthritis I do get some morning stiffness but this is completely different, it's throughout the day pretty much."

237,MSK,doctor,"Oh OK, that's good, and Alright, so I just wanted to the I guess physical exam piece you've already mentioned that it's red, it's swollen and is warm to touch compared to the other knee and um painful to move. Are you having any limping with your gait?"
237,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I barely like I can't really put too much away or move that knee around. So yeah, if I stood up I would have a limp."
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, uh, and is there any instability to either varus or valgus stress?"
237,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, I don't think so."
237,MSK,doctor,"OK, and any instability when testing the ACL or PCL with the anterior and posterior kind of translation test. Pulling and pushing it?"
237,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no."
237,MSK,doctor,OK. And any I don't think I asked this any muscle weakness?

237,MSK,doctor,"And any numbness, tingling?"
237,MSK,patient,No.
237,MSK,doctor,Or burning sensations?
237,MSK,patient,No.
237,MSK,doctor,"OK. Alright, so that was everything that I wanted to check. Was there any anything that I may be missed or any final questions?"
237,MSK,patient,"No, yeah no, I was just I I just don't know if like this is serious and if I need surgery or something because it's been really painful."
237,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment."
237,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good."
238,RES,doctor,I just wanted to start with what brings you here today to the family clinic?
238,RES,patient,"Hi, this morning I read after I woke up by I coughed up some phlegm and there was some blood in it and it it totally scared me."

238,RES,patient,"Uhm, it depends. Yeah, sometimes I can. It can bring on some more coughing."
238,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that."
238,RES,patient,"OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that."
238,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds good. Um. Any, uh, so no recreational, so just besides marijuana. Any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth, anything of that sort?"
238,RES,patient,"Ah, no. Well, sometimes I at parties maybe a few times a year with friends will use ecstasy or something like that, but that's only a few times a year."
238,RES,doctor,"OK. Uh, and any alcohol?"
238,RES,patient,"Yeah, I'll have a few drinks on the weekend with with friends usually. Like rum or beer."
238,RES,doctor,"OK. Yeah, so this is all the questions I had for you today. Any, any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be?"
238,RES,patient,"Uhm, I don't know. I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?"
238,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there."
238,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
238,RES,doctor,"We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment."
238,RES,patient,"Alright, that sounds good. Thank you."
238,RES,doctor,You're welcome.
239,RES,doctor,I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and the cough started two years ago."
239,RES,patient,Yeah.
239,RES,doctor,"OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature."
239,RES,doctor,OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?
239,RES,patient,"Probably like a, a couple teaspoons."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?"
239,RES,patient,"Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red."
239,RES,doctor,OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?
239,RES,patient,"No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed."
239,RES,doctor,"OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?"
239,RES,patient,"Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms."
239,RES,doctor,Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better?
239,RES,patient,"I've tried the Tylenol Cold, hasn't really worked. Tried just other over the counter medications, haven't really worked."
239,RES,doctor,"OK. And prior to two years ago um, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like, uh, like this cough or bringing up blood before?"
239,RES,patient,"In the past, I've always had a somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before?"
239,RES,patient,Yeah I think so.
239,RES,doctor,"OK. Um and so with with this cough and now blood tinged sputum, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?"
239,RES,patient,"Um, I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day."
239,RES,doctor,OK.
239,RES,patient,"Um, sometimes I also feel more breathless on when I'm exerting myself more."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?"
239,RES,patient,"No, no I haven't."
239,RES,doctor,How about any night sweats?
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,Have you lost any weight?
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight. I would say within the last 1 and a 1/2 months probably lost like 8 to 10 pounds."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been trying to lose weight?"
239,RES,patient,"No, not really I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore too. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down."
239,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?"
239,RES,patient,No headaches.
239,RES,doctor,"Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?"
239,RES,patient,"Um, I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes when I'm coughing a lot, I don't feel like eating, but other than that it's been around the same."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, any nausea or vomiting?"
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,Any runny nose or sore throat?
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,OK. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste?
239,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, have you been having any chest pain?"
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,Any heart palpitations?
239,RES,patient,Nope.
239,RES,doctor,Any wheezing when you're breathing?
239,RES,patient,"Sometimes I would say like when when, it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I I can get some wheezing."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?"
239,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
239,RES,doctor,Alright. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath?
239,RES,patient,"No, I'm pretty fine during the night."
239,RES,doctor,"Alright And, uh, have you been having any abdominal pain?"

239,RES,doctor,"I see, OK. Do you take any medications regularly?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, so for the cholesterol taking Rosuvastatin and I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?"
239,RES,patient,I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore?"
239,RES,patient,I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations?"
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,Any allergies to medications?

239,RES,patient,Yup.
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. Um, I am retired so I'm not working anymore. But yeah, that's that's me."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?"
239,RES,patient,"Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?"
239,RES,patient,"So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, do you have any pets?"
239,RES,patient,"No pets, no."
239,RES,doctor,OK um. And do you smoke cigarettes?
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, I smoke, I'd say around 20 cigarettes a day right now."
239,RES,doctor,"Alright, and did you smoke more previously?"
239,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, do you smoke cannabis?"
239,RES,patient,No.
239,RES,doctor,Alright. Do you drink alcohol?
239,RES,patient,"Um just maybe a couple times a month. Nothing, nothing throughout the week."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, so do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or cocaine?"
239,RES,patient,"No, nothing like that."
239,RES,doctor,Alright. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?
239,RES,patient,"No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had a, um like I think one of the like, an arthritis. But yeah, like, but I think that was just like the one that you get with old age."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, like osteoarthritis?"
239,RES,patient,Yeah that that was the one.
239,RES,doctor,OK. Any cancers in the family?
239,RES,patient,"Um, not that, one of my uncles had like um bladder cancer, but that's that's that's about it."
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?"
239,RES,patient,"No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really."
239,RES,doctor,OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?
239,RES,patient,"Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about."
239,RES,doctor,"Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show"
239,RES,patient,Sounds good.
239,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into."
239,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
239,RES,doctor,"Alright, you're welcome, thank you."
240,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?

240,MSK,doctor,"OK, and um do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting, are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly?"
240,MSK,patient,I I just actually probably started this past year. I used to. I used to workout a lot. In University and in my early 30s but then I stopped and this year I've kind of gone back into it.

240,MSK,doctor,"OK, now how about any autoimmune diseases?"
240,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?"
240,MSK,patient,"Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm?"
240,MSK,patient,Yeah yeah.
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?"
240,MSK,patient,Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?"
240,MSK,patient,"It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?"
240,MSK,patient,Yeah.
240,MSK,doctor,"And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?"
240,MSK,patient,Out like at the sides or in front of me?
240,MSK,doctor,In front of you.
240,MSK,patient,"Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement."
240,MSK,patient,"There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that?"
240,MSK,patient,"Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions."
240,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is."
240,MSK,patient,OK.
241,RES,doctor,Could you start with telling me what brought you in today?
241,RES,patient,"Hi, I've just been been so like weak and so tired, I just I can't I can't seem to like get off the couch, like I'll get up from my bed and go lay on the couch and then you know I might be able to get something to eat but I just I get so tired so fast and I don't know I don't know what's wrong."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, when did these symptoms start?"
241,RES,patient,"Um, like I've been feeling pretty tired for like a week, but like this bad for like maybe four days."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, um and so it sounds like you haven't been going to work or like anything like that because you have been so kind of tired and weak."
241,RES,patient,"Yeah, I mean at first I was already kind of working. I'm I'm a truck driver so you know, once you start the job, you kind of have to finish that. I was supposed to go on another another trip like 4 days ago and I just couldn't. I had to call my boss and say that I can't."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, um have you had any like specific muscle weakness like in your legs or or in your arms? Or would you say it's overall like a general weakness?"
241,RES,patient,"It's just everywhere. It's it's not like I can't move. I'm just really, really tired."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, and how, how have you been sleeping?"
241,RES,patient,"I mean, I've just been sleeping like all the time. I have been sleeping all night and then like I said, I get up and I go to the couch and like just fall back asleep."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, have you been having any other symptoms?"
241,RES,patient,"I mean my my throat is maybe a little sore, but nothing nothing else."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, uh, when when did the sore throat first start?"
241,RES,patient,"Probably probably about a week ago. It's not really bad, it's just kinda there."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's it started just before uh, the weakness and fatigue?"
241,RES,patient,"Yeah, around the same time."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and have you been having any pain with swallowing?"
241,RES,patient,"Uh, I mean maybe a little bit."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, like with uh, like solid foods or liquids or both?"
241,RES,patient,"It it's just like it's just like it's a little a little tender. It's not like, really it's not like hard to swallow or anything, it just feels like it's like my throat's kinda tired."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any changes to your voice?"
241,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so. I mean, I live. I live alone so I can't really ask someone else if I have."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, but your voice sounds the same to you?"
241,RES,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
241,RES,doctor,"Alright, um, and so have you been having any fevers or chills?"
241,RES,patient,"Um, I've been, I've been feeling really cold."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any, uh, like shakes or or rigors?"
241,RES,patient,I've been like kind of kind of shivering.
241,RES,doctor,"OK, how about any night sweats?"
241,RES,patient,"Um, yeah, come to think of it, like I was I was, when I was last traveling with, when I was last on it because I'm a truck driver, I I was in the States, I I had to bring something to Ohio, and I had to change my clothes in the night. They were just like so drenched in sweat."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, has that happened more than that that one time?"
241,RES,patient,"Maybe a couple times that it wasn't as bad, that one time was really bad, but here and there like I I've been feeling pretty sweaty at night in general."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had any, uh, like difficulties breathing or shortness of breath?"
241,RES,patient,"Not really, just like kind of tired, but it's not like hard to breathe."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, um have you had a cough?"
241,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, how about a runny nose?"
241,RES,patient,"Maybe maybe a little bit, but not like too noticeable."
241,RES,doctor,"OK, and when did the runny nose start?"

242,RES,patient,"Yeah, thats great."
242,RES,doctor,OK. Sure see you shortly.
243,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so you're a 26 year old, generally healthy and with, sorry back pain?"
243,RES,patient,Chest pain.
243,RES,doctor,"Chest pain, OK. When did the chest pain start?"
243,RES,patient,"Um so I, I guess I I don't know if I'd really call it pain, it's it's been just very uncomfortable, like it just felt a little odd for like a week and a half. It's kind of."
243,RES,doctor,A week and a half?
243,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain uh when I take a deep breath."
243,RES,doctor,OK.
243,RES,patient,"But I don't notice it all the time, it's just, it's often when um I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, did you have any accidents or injuries around that time?"
243,RES,patient,"Uh no, nothing that I can think of."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, did it come on suddenly? Or is it more gradual?"
243,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's uh, no it's it's pretty, it's pretty well, it seems the same each time. It kind of lasts like 20 minutes or so, um and I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil um and I've even tried like a like an Alka-Seltzer and it hasn't really helped very much."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day, it only happens at certain times of the day?"
243,RES,patient,"Yeah, it'll come on for like 20 minutes like here and there."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, anything that you think triggers it?"
243,RES,patient,"I don't I don't really know. Uh I was kind of worried um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing, I I feel like it might it might be, it could be stress uhm but I'm I'm not really sure, my dad had a heart attack last year, he was pretty young. He's like in his 50s and it it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, so these chest pains last for about 20 minutes, it only happens when you take a deep breath in, and after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off, or is it fairly sharp?"
243,RES,patient,"It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more, like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, does it get worse with exercise?"
243,RES,patient,"Uh I don't think so. It just kind of, like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately, 'cause I've just had so much uh schoolwork piling up."
243,RES,doctor,"So you mainly get it at, so you can get it at rest, I should say."
243,RES,patient,"Exactly, yeah, like when I'm studying."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, any fevers? Sick at all last little while?"
243,RES,patient,"Uh no, no, I don't think so."
243,RES,doctor,"No, you've been feeling well otherwise?"
243,RES,patient,"Yeah, I mean, besides just kind of feeling stressed, I uh like I I've been trying to quit smoking and that's been, that's been kind of hard, and school's just very, very busy right now."
243,RES,doctor,When did you stop smoking?
243,RES,patient,"Um so like I guess I'm trying to quit, I'm smoking less than I used to. I probably smoked 5 cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?"
243,RES,patient,"Um it's just that I'm I'm doing my Masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final uh thesis and there's just a lot involved and it's it's just making me very nervous."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?"
243,RES,patient,"Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this. I've never felt like so, like there is so little time to do the work that I need to do."
243,RES,doctor,"Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before, anytime in your life?"
243,RES,patient,"No, no, not before this."
243,RES,doctor,"OK. So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything, and you said you smoke. When did you start smoking?"
243,RES,patient,"Um like when I was probably 18 I I sometimes smoked a little and then I smoked a little more, um maybe like 10 cigarettes a day for uh like the last two years. But then a few months ago I've been I've been cutting it in half."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, now when you get this this chest pain, do you ever feel short of breath?"
243,RES,patient,"Um I I think I I make myself nervous with it and then I kind of start breathing faster, but I don't have a hard, I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise, and it's hard to get a deep breath 'cause I'm, it makes me really nervous."
243,RES,doctor,Does your heart ever flutter? Feel like it's skipping a beat?
243,RES,patient,"Uhm no, only if I, only if I, if I, if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that's felt like that before, but not any other time"
243,RES,doctor,"OK, don't get any chest pain, all right, and just in terms of other things, so anything else you've seen a doctor for in the past? You mentioned anxiety attacks."
243,RES,patient,"Yeah, um like I talked to my family doctor about that when I was a teenager but I really haven't, you know, seen my doctor for it anytime in the last like eight years or so."
243,RES,doctor,Anything else you see your family
243,RES,patient,"I don't, oh, sorry, no nothing else. I just I thought I was kind of, when I was in high school I had those and then I really haven't for a long time. But um lately I felt like this like I could maybe get them again."
243,RES,doctor,So you've never had asthma as a child?
243,RES,patient,Uh no.
243,RES,doctor,And you don't have asthma now?
243,RES,patient,No.
243,RES,doctor,"OK, do you take any medications right now?"
243,RES,patient,"Uh no, like I take like a multi vitamin but that's it."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, and you live in London?"
243,RES,patient,"Mhmm, like for school."
243,RES,doctor,"Got it. You're doing a Masters in social work, anyone around you been sick at all last little while?"
243,RES,patient,"No, like I live alone, I haven't really seen very many people lately."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, and how do you manage stress when you do get it?"
243,RES,patient,"Um I try to I try to like set some time aside just to read books that like I like to read instead of like school books uh at night time, and uh I do really enjoy running, it's, I've been a little bit nervous to do it lately, but usually I run like a few times a week."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, and when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain?"
243,RES,patient,"Um like when I'm really, when I'm work, like working with classmates or uh like thinking really like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it or if I if I'm like working on a task with my hands, but it's when I'm walking and I am alone kind of with my thoughts or when I'm studying, that's when I when I get it."
243,RES,doctor,"Understood and you said your father passed early from a heart attack, I'm sorry, but anyone else in your family either your parents or mum have any health issues?"
243,RES,patient,"Oh he's uh he's alive, like he had a heart attack and just now he has to see a lot of heart doctors. Um no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um he just kind of, he just passed away young from um like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure."
243,RES,doctor,"Got it, so no one has died suddenly with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming?"
243,RES,patient,No.
243,RES,doctor,"No one's ever talked about arrhythmias, or is that a word familiar to you?"
243,RES,patient,"No, no, just my dad and his heart attack. That's like the only thing I know of."
243,RES,doctor,"OK, sounds good. I think I've got all the information I need and I'll pass it on to the doctor who'll take a look at you, OK? Have a good one."
243,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
244,RES,doctor,So what brings you in the clinic today?
244,RES,patient,"Hey, uh I just had this cough that's been like really bothering me."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, how long have you had that for?"
244,RES,patient,"Uh like in the past few days, it's been really like gross and I've been coughing up this like gunk, but I've had it for, I've honestly had a cough for like three months, it's just like sometimes it's like there, and sometimes it kind of goes away. It feels like it keeps coming back."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any chest pain?"
244,RES,patient,"Um no, like it kinda hurts when I cough now but not not like on its own."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any fevers at home? Or fevers at all in the last couple days?"
244,RES,patient,"Uh I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days, uh but like I didn't actually take my temp."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked?"
244,RES,patient,"Uh no, not that."
244,RES,doctor,"Nothing like that, OK, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss over the last little while?"
244,RES,patient,"Um, no."
244,RES,doctor,"So so you go on the scale, you lost a few pounds, but you haven't been trying to basically."
244,RES,patient,"No, like I, I don't really weigh myself, but I don't think so."
244,RES,doctor,So you haven't been noticing clothes have been fitting loose or anything like that?
244,RES,patient,"No, no, like I wish but no."
244,RES,doctor,"Got it, got it. Now let's talk about what you're bringing up with your cough. What colour is it?"
244,RES,patient,It's really gross. It's kind of like greenish.
244,RES,doctor,"Greenish, OK, and also any red or any blood with it?"
244,RES,patient,No.
244,RES,doctor,"OK. And doesn't smell at all, smell funky?"
244,RES,patient,I haven't noticed.
244,RES,doctor,"OK, so you've just been bringing this stuff up for the last couple of days, when specifically? Two days ago, three days ago?"
244,RES,patient,Like maybe maybe three days.
244,RES,doctor,"Three days ago, and you said before that you kind of had this dry cough before. Uh when did you first notice that? Three months ago, you said?"
244,RES,patient,"Yeah, I was uh, I I do like um, it like sounds silly but I do like a pole dancing class just for exercise and I was like at my class and I kind of just started to like feel like I was like a little coughy and like I don't think there's anything special, that was just like when I noticed it."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, anyone at the class sick at that time?"
244,RES,patient,"I don't think so, like it's a really long time ago, I don't really remember."
244,RES,doctor,"Got it, got it. Anyone sick near you or around you in the last couple of weeks?"
244,RES,patient,"No, no, not that I can think of."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, and regarding other, any, we already talked about chest pain, uh you've been able to eat food alright?"
244,RES,patient,"Uh yeah, like uh yeah it's like pretty normal."
244,RES,doctor,"So no nausea, no vomiting?"
244,RES,patient,"Uh no, none of that."
244,RES,doctor,"You don't have a stiff neck at all, do you?"
244,RES,patient,"No, no I don't."
244,RES,doctor,"OK, but how about other parts of your body? Any pain? Tenderness anywhere?"
244,RES,patient,"I don't think so, no. Like I'm I'm a little tired now, um like the cough is like maybe for like a month, it's been kind of waking me up a little bit so my my sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think it's like I have like pain. I'm just like tired."
244,RES,doctor,OK so the cough does wake you up at night?
244,RES,patient,Yeah.
244,RES,doctor,Does it wake you up every night?
244,RES,patient,"Yeah, like pretty well, for like the last, not like all three months, but probably the last month."
244,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright. I'm just gonna move on, talk a little bit about you and the past. Uh so any issues that you've seen a doctor for before?"
244,RES,patient,Uh just like eczema.
244,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you take anything for that?"
244,RES,patient,"Just like moisturizing creams, um like my family doctor back home said like, a couple times when it was really bad she would give me one like to go get at like shoppers, but right now it's not bad so I just have just like a regular cream."

I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I’ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don’t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe."
245,RES,doctor,"I see OK, so this is happened in the past three days. Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time?"

It's generally pretty like I've been really trying to take care of it, but um I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time, yeah, so my blood pressure is like OK right now."

245,RES,patient,"No, nothing that I can think of."
245,RES,doctor,"Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?"
245,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
245,RES,doctor,Your welcome.

247,MSK,doctor,"Five years OK, any side effects or any issues with that?"
247,MSK,patient,"No, it's been good day I, I've been really happy with it overall too. They help regulate my cycles."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, good. And then are you up to date with your immunizations?"
247,MSK,patient,"I am yes, I'll get the flu shot every year."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's good. Do you have any allergies?"
247,MSK,patient,"I do, yeah, but it's I think they're just all environmental, 'cause I'll typically get issues with seasonal changes and then then it goes away."
247,MSK,doctor,"Oh I see. OK, any family history of lung or heart conditions?"
247,MSK,patient,"I think my dad has high blood pressure, and diabetes. Yeah, but no heart or or lung conditions."

247,MSK,patient,"No, I don't."
247,MSK,doctor,OK. And then do you drink alcohol?
247,MSK,patient,"Every once in a while I'll have a glass of wine, but it's usually a social thing or or at Christmas."
247,MSK,doctor,OK. Come have out in terms of sick Contacts. Have you had any recently?
247,MSK,patient,"I don't believe so. Um I've been going to work, I work as a bank teller, um but everybody at work hasn't been sick and we've been using masks and cleaning our hands and all of that sort of thing."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, that's good. And how about travel? Have you had any recently?"
247,MSK,patient,"No, I've been put at home, but looking forward to a vacation though."
247,MSK,doctor,"Yeah for sure. And then, where do you work and who do you live with and where do you live?"
247,MSK,patient,"Yes, I I work at a bank. And I live with my husband and our time and our son, he’s, he's six."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. OK, um those are all the questions I have for history. We can move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Did you have any questions before we did that?"
247,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, no, that sounds good."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK so if you have someone there with you, or if you have a mirror, or if there's any way you can take a look at the back of your neck as well as the front of your neck um. Do you see any redness or swelling in that area?"
247,MSK,patient,"No, I don’t."
247,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. Do you see any muscle atrophy? Any deformities or skin changes?"
247,MSK,patient,"No, nothing like that."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK. And then when you kind of just with the back of your hand, place it on your neck in the front as well as the back, does it feel warm at all?"
247,MSK,patient,No.
247,MSK,doctor,No OK. And then I'm gonna get you to palpate certain areas so we'll start with the chin. Does that hurt when you press down?
247,MSK,patient,No.
247,MSK,doctor,"No OK, how about just where the thyroid would be?"
247,MSK,patient,"No pain or yeah, no pain there."
247,MSK,doctor,"No pain there OK. How about to the sides, kind of where your. Sternocleidomastoid muscles are?"
247,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I think like a little bit of tenderness in the the front of the neck muscles there."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK and then how about when you move towards the back and then on your C spine, cervical spine just like at the very back of your neck?"
247,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so there's there's no pain when I push on the like bones I can feel like so, actually on that that like C spine itself there's no pain, but like oh off to the side so on the muscles. To the sides or there's a bit of tenderness."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, so kind of like where, so there's pain on their trapezius and deltoid muscles?"
247,MSK,patient,"Uhm. Uh. Yeah, more trapezius not so not so much deltoid and then also, um, like the the perispinal muscles."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, I see, alright. Uhm. OK, and then let's move on to some range of motion exam so I'm gonna get you to flex your neck. So look down at the ground all the way as much as you can. Does that hurt?"
247,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah."
247,MSK,doctor,It does but you're able to fully flex your neck.
247,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I can touch my chin to my chest all almost uh but yeah, I'll get pain at the back of my neck when I do that and the front."
247,MSK,doctor,And the front? OK. And then how about when you extend your head all the way back so that you're looking at the ceiling?
247,MSK,patient,"I’m able to do it still is a bit stiff and it's slow to get there, but again I I get pain at the back in the front of my neck when I'm doing this."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, how about when you flex your neck to the side so that your right ear is touching your right shoulder?"
247,MSK,patient,"Um yeah, I get there's a little bit of a pain in the muscles on the left side when I'm doing that"
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, and then how about when you do the opposite? Touch your left ear to your left shoulder so that you're laterally flexing your neck on the left side?"
247,MSK,patient,"A little bit of pain there too, but I'm able to do it though."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK. So you're able to do all of these, it's just that you have some pain when you do that?"
247,MSK,patient,"Yeah, exactly, I could do all of the movements, but yeah, it's pain and stiffness."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"
247,MSK,patient,"Uh no, that I just was wondering if I if you think I I don’t, needed an X Ray or like you think that anything is broken. Kind of like concerned about today, because of this pain."
247,MSK,doctor,"Yeah. And for sure, um so right now it just to me it sounds like a whiplash injury and so kind of like low impact. But just to be certain, we can order an X Ray to rule out any fractures or dislocations. And in terms of like the management plan, for pain management you can rest, you can either apply heat or cold packs to your neck for 15 minutes every couple of hours or so. You can try some over the counter pain medications like Ibuprofen or Tylenol. And if it still doesn't get better, we can try like, we can try injections to the area to relieve some of that pain, but something else in conjunction we can try as physiotherapy and they'll basically help you with. Range of motion exercises and try to strengthen the muscles in that area and to improve your posture and normal movement. And that's kind of where we can start for now. And if it doesn't get any better, we can talk about alternative management plans, does that sound OK?"
247,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, that that makes sense. Thank you."
247,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, no worries."
248,RES,doctor,It's nice to meet you. What's your name?

248,RES,doctor,"OK, and is it mostly sore, kind of like midline? Or is it more sorta one side versus the other?"
248,RES,patient,"Um I'd say, maybe the, uh, the right side is a little bit more sore, but I think I can feel it on both sides of my neck."
248,RES,doctor,"OK, and how bad would you say your discomfort is 1 to 10, 10 being the worst."
248,RES,patient,"Um. I would say maybe a two or three if I move my neck I I can feel it more, but otherwise I can just barely notice that it's there."
248,RES,doctor,"OK, so it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing, things like that?"

248,RES,doctor,"OK, and you said this started when like was this before the sore throat or after?"
248,RES,patient,Oh I can't like remember the onset. I I think that the sore throat started first and maybe a rash came a little bit later.
248,RES,doctor,"OK, OK and have you noticed that your that your glands are swollen?"
248,RES,patient,"I think so, um maybe that's what's swollen in my neck."

248,RES,patient,"Oh, I've heard of mono before."
248,RES,doctor,"Yeah,"

248,RES,patient,"Um, no, I think that's you covered everything."
248,RES,doctor,"OK alright so I will will go off a few, we'll try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which I would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as. And we'll go from there. Does that sound good?"

250,RES,doctor,"No, OK. And is the cough constant or does it come and go?"
250,RES,patient,"It, it comes and goes. I would say sometimes it can be worse. Yeah, depending on on what I'm what I'm doing. I guess if I'm exercising or if it's if it's really cold outside, it might get worse."
250,RES,doctor,"OK. And do you feel that it's been getting worse at all, your cough?"
250,RES,patient,"Uh, not really, I think it's about the same."

250,RES,doctor,"OK, and how often are you coughing? Let's say in an average day?"
250,RES,patient,"Um, it's uh, it's pretty variable. I would say, so if I'm exercising it will it'll throw me into a coughing fit and and sometimes it's really bugging me at night too it'll affect me. It's impairing my sleep."
250,RES,doctor,"OK, and so exercise makes it worse. Anything that you do that helps you relieve the cough?"
250,RES,patient,"Uhm, I actually I tried my sons inhaler and it seemed to actually help, but one of the days I just couldn't seem to stop the cough and I wanted to sleep so I gave it a try and it it seemed to actually help with the cough."
250,RES,doctor,"OK, and so your son has inhalers, does he have asthma?"

250,RES,patient,"Uhm, nope, that was it."
250,RES,doctor,"OK, so based on what we talked about, it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you're having right now, one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma. Um, it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there."
250,RES,patient,That sounds great. Thank you.
250,RES,doctor,"You're welcome. Well, take care."
251,MSK,doctor,How may I help you?
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so I'm I'm George, the father, my daughter is 5 years old and I noticed just a few days ago that she was walking a little bit funny and kind of having a limp when she came back from school. And since since that then, she's been saying that it just hurts too much to put any weight on on that leg, on the right leg. And since then I've been like carrying her around. It's been very painful for her. So I just wanted to come in and check what might be going on."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK and so so. And this, when did this exactly start?"
251,MSK,patient,So just two days ago.
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, an um did she have any trauma to her right hip or or to hurt your right leg like a fall or any injuries?"
251,MSK,patient,"Sorry um no. Not that I know of at least and she hasn't told me anything like that. She does do some activities, some sports, but I haven't seen her fall anywhere."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um. Alright, and uh, has she has she not not been able to walk then?"
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so I've I've been carrying around for at least like she's missed school too, but been carrying her around for the last 1 1/2 to two days. As soon as I had like ask her to walk she starts kind of a hopping and saying that there's a lot of pain near the top of her leg and by your hips whenever she puts her foot like a foot down. So yeah, she's in pain crying, so I kind of have to carry her."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK. And, uh, how has her behaviour been recently like her mood and things like that?"
251,MSK,patient,"She's definitely been more just, a bit anxious about the pain. Very scared about putting her foot down and just overall, I think also more irritable crying more because of the pain so but I I guess I understand if there's something going on it must be very painful."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and. Alright, has she had any fevers or chills?"
251,MSK,patient,"Uhm I. Did notice a couple of days ago she felt a bit warm but we didn't really measure her temperature. Over the last few weeks, though, she has had a. Kind of a runny nose and a cough and I think she might have had a fever last week as well so she has been sick recently."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, so it sounds like she might have had a cold last week and did like the runny nose and cough go away?"
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, the runny nose and cough are gone. Fever was gone too, but she did feel a little bit warm yesterday so I'm not sure about that."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, so she's at a a bit warm now still OK."
251,MSK,patient,Yup.
251,MSK,doctor,Has she had any any headaches?
251,MSK,patient,"No, no headaches."

251,MSK,doctor,"OK, I'm and in the past has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions?"
251,MSK,patient,"She did have this condition with her hips. Dysplasia, like developmental dysplasia of the hip. So when she was born she she was getting like this clicking noise and her, in her hips and so she was in this splint for probably almost two months at the start, like after she was born."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and did her hips, did like was she able to walk afterwards?"
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, yeah. And we were seeing a specialist, an orthopedic surgeon and they were managing her and after one year they stopped following her. She was well like she was walking, no issues."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, so she's walking around one year."
251,MSK,patient,Mmm
251,MSK,doctor,"Have you had any other concerns about her, either social or physical development?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, she's been really great. She's good with people, she's has great social skills. She has grown well, met all her milestones, she's doing really well at school and gets along well with her peers as well."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, excellent. And were there any concerns throughout pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes or hypertension or any exposures to infections?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, her mom's pregnancy was perfectly normal. She was born, like she was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks. She was breech at that time, which the doctor said might have to do with her clicking hips. But yeah, but since then or during pregnancy, no other complications."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, that's great. And. Uh, in regards to, you mentioned her hurt hip any other past medical history?"
251,MSK,patient,Um no other than that she's been healthy.
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and does she take any medications regularly over the counter or prescribed?"
251,MSK,patient,"No no, no medications."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, any allergies to medications?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, not that I know."
251,MSK,doctor,"And sorry has she taking anything for the, the pain?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, I haven't really given her anything, I didn't know what to give."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK all right, we'll talk more about that. Has she had any prior surgeries or hospitalizations?"
251,MSK,patient,No.
251,MSK,doctor,Can you tell me about who she's living with and whereabouts she's living?
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so she's currently living at home with me, my wife, and she has an older brother. We live in a small house just near near the city."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and what do you guys do for work?"
251,MSK,patient,"Yeah, so I'm a lawyer and my wife is a music teacher."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, is there anybody who smokes in the home?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, none of us smoke."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK um, OK, And any family history of heart or lung conditions?"
251,MSK,patient,"Uhm, no, no family history our family is pretty healthy."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, how about any family history of any autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism?"
251,MSK,patient,No nothing like that.
251,MSK,doctor,OK. And then any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions in the family?
251,MSK,patient,No.
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, so next on um just the exam. Um when you're looking at the right hip are you seeing any swelling, redness?"
251,MSK,patient,"Uh, no, not that I see anything."
251,MSK,doctor,"No OK, and is there any like muscle atrophy around the hip?"
251,MSK,patient,"No, not that I see at all."
251,MSK,doctor,OK and then is there any misalignment or deformity of the joints that you can see?
251,MSK,patient,"No, I can't. Yeah, I don't see anything in the hips or legs that really points out to me."
251,MSK,doctor,OK um and is there any pain to palpation over the hip or or knee?
251,MSK,patient,"Uh, if I if I press on it, I don't think she's in that much pain. It's mainly just when she's trying to walk or put put weight on it."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and is she able to move the hip in a full range of motion of like flexion, and extension, abduction, adduction?"
251,MSK,patient,"Uhm, so she does. She is able to move it if she really tries. But it's mainly just the putting her weight on it and anytime she puts her weight on it is is when it really hurts."
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, so more about the weight on it, and is she able to move that her knee with a full range of motion?"
251,MSK,patient,Yeah.
251,MSK,doctor,"OK, and any any muscle weakness when testing around the joint?"
251,MSK,patient,No.
251,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check was there anything I maybe forgot about you thought would be more important today,"
251,MSK,patient,No I think that's all just just was wondering what might be going on?
251,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, certainly, so a couple of things that it could be. One is that it can be common in this age group is something called transient synovitis. Where, which can happen in the hip where there's some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection. And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess."
251,MSK,patient,"OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
252,RES,doctor,What brings you in here today?
252,RES,patient,"Hey, I'm I'm the mom of, of the patient. He's he's a kid, he has had, he just had a cough and stuffy nose for the past three days."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and so did they both start around the same time or one started before the other?"
252,RES,patient,"They started the same time. He's also had like these, these, his eyes have been like kind of red and watery as well."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he, what kind of cough is he having a dry cough or wet cough?"
252,RES,patient,It's a dry cough.
252,RES,doctor,"Dry cough, OK and and so with the congestion is he also having any kind of nasal drainage?"
252,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's it's like watery."
252,RES,doctor,Watery OK so now are you noticing any kind of yellow or greenish material?
252,RES,patient,No.
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and he hasn't, is he coughing up any blood at all at any point?"
252,RES,patient,No no no.
252,RES,doctor,And so this started just recently three days ago. Was he in contact with anyone that's been sick recently?
252,RES,patient,"I don't think so, but he has been like playing outside quite a bit. And sometimes he's just playing with the neighbours kids."
252,RES,doctor,OK. Has this happened before?
252,RES,patient,"Yeah it has, but I guess what I'm concerned about is the rash that he has now that he's never had before."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and where is the rash, exactly?"
252,RES,patient,It's on his face. It started this morning.
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and can you describe the rash for me like it's color, shapes, and what kind of looks like?"
252,RES,patient,"Small really small dots like kind of, uhm, like I'd say like brown in color. Like brownish dark reddish."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, let's just are they just located on his face?"
252,RES,patient,"Yeah, like it was on his face and it's kind of a little bit on his neck."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, uh and is he scratching at them at all?"

252,RES,patient,"Uh, he has been feeling a little bit warm. I didn't really check his temperature."
252,RES,doctor,"And. And busy so, it started three days ago. Anything happened before 3 days at all that might have caused the symptoms?"
252,RES,patient,"I don't think so. As I said, he has been playing around with others so could have caught something?"
252,RES,doctor,"OK, And OK, any kind of ah, have you tried anything that has helped him at all? Any medications?"
252,RES,patient,"Uhm? I haven't tried anything yet, no."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and how often is he coughing? Is he coughing throughout the day or is it more so with exerting himself?"
252,RES,patient,"Um, it's just kind of all through the day. It's actually gotten a little bit better. Uhm, the cough has gotten better. But what I'm concerned about is the, the rash?"
252,RES,doctor,OK cough's gotten better yeah. Does he have visit rush it so is it mainly just on his forehead or also on his cheeks?
252,RES,patient,"It's on his cheeks on his chin. It's kind of on his neck. It's kind of like this blotchy reddish, brownish like little dots. Kind of, it's not like, it's not raised, it's like flat."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh. Is it kind of just a bit like a bright red rash that's kind of covering the cheeks or little little dots everywhere?"
252,RES,patient,Kind of little dots.
252,RES,doctor,"OK, any anything on his nose?"
252,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, it's on his nose as well."

252,RES,doctor,"OK. So yeah, so, we'll, we'll be doing a couple we'll do a physical examination, I want to see examined with the rash looks like and there's many things that can cause a rash. There's uh viral infections that can cause some of the symptoms. The symptoms he's having mainly seen viral with a dry cough and runny nose. And then you can we have a rash as well. One thing I forgot to ask actually is is he fully immunized?"
252,RES,patient,"Um, he I guess he didn't get all his immunizations done earlier. He did get them a little bit later so we came from Syria as refugees. But I I'm thinking he got all his immunizations when he, uh, came to, when we moved to Canada."
252,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he complaining of joint or muscle aches at all?"
252,RES,patient,No.
252,RES,doctor,"No, nothing like that, OK. Alright, so yeah, we'll do it like a full physical examination, and if it's more just a viral, it'll be something that we'll just have to monitor and do supportive care for. But if it's anything else we might need to do further investigations. OK, and we'll just do a COVID swab for him today as well as some of the symptoms overlap with COVID symptoms and you will get the results back in 24 hours to 48 hours and then further instruction from public health."
252,RES,patient,Sounds great.
252,RES,doctor,"Alright, well, take care, talk to you soon."
253,RES,doctor,How may I help you today?
253,RES,patient,"I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often."
253,RES,doctor,Does he still have these symptoms?
253,RES,patient,"Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so."
253,RES,doctor,Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.
253,RES,patient,Yeah.
253,RES,doctor,Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?
253,RES,patient,"Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough."
253,RES,doctor,OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?
253,RES,patient,"Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?"
253,RES,patient,It's dry.
253,RES,doctor,OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.
253,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't said anything like that."
253,RES,doctor,"Alright, any fevers?"
253,RES,patient,"No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers."
253,RES,doctor,"I see. OK, any headaches?"
253,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't said anything like that."
253,RES,doctor,OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms?
253,RES,patient,"Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal."
253,RES,doctor,"OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?"
253,RES,patient,"Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?"
253,RES,patient,"Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him."
253,RES,doctor,"OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?"
253,RES,patient,"Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?"
253,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't had anything like that."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy?"
253,RES,patient,"Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term"
253,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, that's great."
253,RES,patient,"And he, oh sorry, I was just going to say normal weight as well."
253,RES,doctor,"OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?"
253,RES,patient,"I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there?"
253,RES,patient,Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones.
253,RES,doctor,"OK, and is he going to school?"
253,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months."
253,RES,doctor,"Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies."
253,RES,patient,"Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1."
253,RES,doctor,"I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?"
253,RES,patient,"No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well."
253,RES,doctor,"OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?"
253,RES,patient,"No, he hasn't actually."
253,RES,doctor,Has he been on any medications?
253,RES,patient,"Um, he he has not."
253,RES,doctor,Any allergies that he has?
253,RES,patient,"Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so."
253,RES,doctor,"From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?"
253,RES,patient,"Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?"
253,RES,doctor,"Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes."
253,RES,patient,Ok.
253,RES,doctor,You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?
253,RES,patient,"Yeah, I don't notice that any other times."
253,RES,doctor,"Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see."
253,RES,patient,"OK, great, thank you."
254,RES,doctor,What brings you here today?
254,RES,patient,"I've had uh a new cough that started um this week, it's been going on the last like three or four days and um I've had a headache and um but yesterday I just noticed that I haven't been able to to smell, so I wanted to come in this morning."

255,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"
255,RES,patient,"No, I I was just wondering what this can be."
255,RES,doctor,"Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?"
255,RES,patient,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
255,RES,doctor,"OK. Great, no problem."
256,GEN,doctor,"Hi, what brings you to clinic today?"
256,GEN,patient,"Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for awhile. I've had a few bladder infections in the past and this is usually how how they feel. I feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I you know I I could be getting it, but I also just don't wanna let it go keep going if I do have an infection. I just like rather get it like treated if I do."
256,GEN,doctor,OK understood. When was your last period?
256,GEN,patient,"Um, like 2 weeks ago."
256,GEN,doctor,"About two weeks ago, are you fairly regular?"
256,GEN,patient,"Like yes and no, it's. I'm I'm not super irregular, but I I sometimes have like basically it's like I alternate sometimes. I my cycles like 4 weeks and sometimes it's more like 5."
256,GEN,doctor,"Sorry, just clarify again, you're 30 years old?"
256,GEN,patient,Yeah I'm 30.
256,GEN,doctor,Ok are you on any contraception right now?
256,GEN,patient,"Uh, no, I'm not."
256,GEN,doctor,Ok. Are you sexually active at all?
256,GEN,patient,No.
256,GEN,doctor,"No? Ok. So just in terms of your urinary tract infections, when was your last one?"
256,GEN,patient,I had one like 3 months ago maybe.
256,GEN,doctor,"3 months ago ok, and they prescribed you antibiotics and it went away fairly quickly?"
256,GEN,patient,"Yeah yeah it went away like I always I always have an overactive bladder and I always have to go pretty frequently, like every hour, sometimes half hour. But so that's still there, but like it hasn't ever since then, I haven't had any like pain with it."
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go?"
256,GEN,patient,Yeah.
256,GEN,doctor,"Kind of going more frequently, but I suppose the new thing you're a little bit concerned about is that it, it burns a little bit, it stings a little bit when you do urinate. Am I understanding correctly?"
256,GEN,patient,"Exactly like for the past couple days, it's felt like that."
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok, has it been getting progressively worse at all?"
256,GEN,patient,"Um, maybe a little bit I I feel like now I can recognize it pretty early when it's not too bad to kind of get ahead of it."
256,GEN,doctor,OK understood. And do you have any pain kind of behind your ribs at all? On your back?
256,GEN,patient,"Sorry, can you repeat that?"
256,GEN,doctor,"You haven't had any pain on your back, middle back kind of close to your ribs, have you?"
256,GEN,patient,Not that I can think of.
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok, and have you noticed any changes to the quality of the urine? For example has it looked frothy or smelled bad?"
256,GEN,patient,"It maybe looked like a little cloudy. But nothing, nothing else out of the ordinary like I've never had blood in it or anything."
256,GEN,doctor,Understood. Have you noticed any visual changes in the area near the vagina?
256,GEN,patient,"No, not that I can think of."
256,GEN,doctor,"Like any lesions, anything like that? Anything concerned for an STI that you're worried about?"
256,GEN,patient,"No, and like I haven't had like had a sexual partner in a few years."
256,GEN,doctor,"Understood, understood. These are kind of questions that we ask when someone's having a little bit of maybe an issue holding in their urine. Have you ever felt any numbness or inability to feel kind of around your buttocks region? For example, when you wipe with tissue paper, can you feel that well?"
256,GEN,patient,"Oh yeah, I can feel everything."
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok and no changes to your poops, to your bowel movements?"
256,GEN,patient,"No, nothing, pretty normal."
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok, and how do you feel otherwise?"
256,GEN,patient,"I, I mean, I feel I feel a little tired, felt like a little hot yesterday. I don't have a thermometer so like I didn't take my temperature but, you know, sometimes I feel a little hot like when I've had the infections before."
256,GEN,doctor,"OK, you don't have any swelling on your anywhere in your body on your ankles, do you?"

256,GEN,doctor,No? No markings across the bridge of your nose and your cheeks?
256,GEN,patient,No.
256,GEN,doctor,"Ok, and then in regards otherwise you feel a little flushed, a little tired? Any other medical issues that you have?"
256,GEN,patient,"No, just this like overactive bladder thing."
256,GEN,doctor,"OK, and have they given you any medications for it?"
256,GEN,patient,"We tried a few different ones before, now I get I get Botox injections into the bladder like maybe twice a year."
256,GEN,doctor,"Anything else they've used recently? Like any medications you're on right now, I suppose?"
256,GEN,patient,"No, nothing no nothing else. Yeah, I guess I have like I have an inhaler but I don't use it all the time like I haven't had to."
256,GEN,doctor,"Oh, so you have asthma?"
256,GEN,patient,"Yeah, like I honestly don't feel like I have it very much now, but I still have like I still have the inhaler."
256,GEN,doctor,"Understood, understood. Anything else, you've taken medications for in the past?"

257,RES,patient,No.
257,RES,doctor,"OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there."
257,RES,patient,Sure.
257,RES,doctor,So you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital.

258,RES,doctor,How do you take any medications to help with your symptoms?
258,RES,patient,"Yeah, some over the counter cold medicines. I tried some to take Tylenol cold and sinus or something like that anyway and it did help me sleep a little bit with that the headache and just haven't been feeling very good, to help with that."
258,RES,doctor,"And tell me about your fever. Did you check it check it, check your temperature?"

258,RES,patient,I would say maybe a 5.
258,RES,doctor,"OK, and you mentioned that the Tylenol helped."

258,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm. Have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?"
258,RES,patient,"I will without, well, yeah I there a couple or last weekend. Actually there was a family party that we went to. It was outside, but uh, it, yeah, there's people around. There was nobody that was sick that I'm aware of."
258,RES,doctor,OK. And and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?
258,RES,patient,"No been besides that, the family party last weekend, but I mean that was just here in town so. It was close by."
258,RES,doctor,"OK, I guess I forgot to ask about a symptom. Have you felt that you've lost your sense of smell or sense of taste? Has it just been different?"
258,RES,patient,"Yeah, I said some actually now that you mention it right sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird, 'cause I I don't have, everybody knows or I don't feel congested or anything. So yeah, but my taste has been OK."
258,RES,doctor,"Good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve. Or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?"
258,RES,patient,"No, that sounds really good, thank you."
259,MSK,patient,"My back, it just really hurts. I feel really stiff in the morning and um yeah, it's just been going on for a few months now."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts, where exactly would you say it hurts?"
259,MSK,patient,"It kinda hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that hurts most, kind of hurts like all down my my back."
259,MSK,doctor,"OK, all the way up to I guess your neck and all the way down to your lower back?"
259,MSK,patient,"So I wouldn't really say the neck, and I guess more of the the lower parts. Maybe like the middle of my back and..."
259,MSK,doctor,I see.
259,MSK,patient,And down.
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok and what kind of pain would you say it is, is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it?"
259,MSK,patient,It's a dull pain.
259,MSK,doctor,"Dull pain, ok. Ok, and on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the least amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it?"
259,MSK,patient,"It's about a four or five. I mean some days it can be better, but yeah, some days it can be worse."
259,MSK,doctor,OK and when did this start?
259,MSK,patient,"I think this started about like four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now."
259,MSK,doctor,"OK, and when it first started up, was there anything that caused the back pain? Like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this?"
259,MSK,patient,"No, nothing that it's I I can think of. It's sort of it's come on so slowly like when I first started noticing the back pain it it was maybe like a 0 to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last 5, 6 months it has gotten has gotten a bit worse."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, so it kind of came on progressively. Didn't just come on suddenly at some point?"
259,MSK,patient,"Right, yeah, it's been getting worse."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this?"
259,MSK,patient,"Uh, not not in my back pain. I do get pain in my right knee and in my hands sometimes. But those pains just kind of come and go."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and when did those pains start?"
259,MSK,patient,"Uhm, those ones started, probably similar timeline around six months ago."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, ok. And in the back pain that you're having, does it radiate or move to any other part of your body?"
259,MSK,patient,"No, I don't feel it anywhere else."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain? Any medications or anything?"
259,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil, and that the Advil is actually helped taking the edge off a little bit, but the next morning I I have the stiffness and and pain again."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse?"

259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, alright, so those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly uh, ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that?"
259,MSK,patient,"Uhm no, I haven't noticed really any any uh redness or or swelling"
259,MSK,doctor,"OK and no so, are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards so without pain or are you in any pain?"
259,MSK,patient,"Uhm, I do get it. It's a bit stiff. Uhm I, uh, yeah, I'm not really too sure it's like, not really, it's more more more stiff."
259,MSK,doctor,"Ok, and yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns?"
259,MSK,patient,"Uhm, yeah, I was just wondering, yeah, like like what what this could be possibly?"
259,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so definitely what so this this seems like it started off like 3 months or six months ago, and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. And how old did you say you were?"
259,MSK,patient,Uhm I'm 26.
259,MSK,doctor,"OK, yeah, so uh, it seems progressive and you're getting some pain in your other joints as well and it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that we would have to rule out. So you first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatic arthritis. You don't have any other skins, changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called reactive arthritis - where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age and it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment or for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as a X Ray of the of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibodies. Those are just some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah those are and then will also get an X Ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that we'll take. Do you have any questions or concerns?"
259,MSK,patient,"No, that that sounds, that sounds great, thank you."
259,MSK,doctor,"Alright, yeah, so I will get in touch with you shortly."
259,MSK,patient,"Sounds great, thank you."
259,MSK,doctor,"Alright, take care."
259,MSK,patient,Bye.
259,MSK,doctor,Bye.
260,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?

260,MSK,patient,"No, I can't think of anything uh like specific that happened, but there was one night where um like after work, I was sitting down after dinner and um I got pretty stiff that night. It was pretty sore and kind of ever since then, it's been been sore."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, um and is this a persistent kind of back pain or does it come and go?"
260,MSK,patient,"It's um, I can kind of always feel it, but it certainly gets worse if I am moving. So if I'm just kind of sitting at rest, I don't really, yeah, I don't really feel it that much."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, um would you say it's sharp, throbbing, achy, crampy?"
260,MSK,patient,"I'd say I get kind of uh, it's a sharp pain."
260,MSK,doctor,"Sharp pain, OK. Um does anything make it better or worse?"
260,MSK,patient,Um better would just be uh resting.
260,MSK,doctor,OK.
260,MSK,patient,"Um kind of just lying down, or um yeah, just just trying to uh rest. But um making it worse, yeah, if I'm uh like really any movement um if I'm like bending forward or um kind of like leaning to the side, I start to get um get some pain in the lower back."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. And then 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad or uh how severe would you rate it?"

260,MSK,patient,"Um a little bit, I can feel it pulling and stretching, yeah."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um alright, and then I'm gonna get you to uh like laterally flex to your right side. So kind of like you're doing an exercise um and you're just like bending towards that side."
260,MSK,patient,"Yeah, that hurts."

260,MSK,patient,Yeah that hurts too.
260,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um and now I wanna get you to uh bring your knees up towards the ceiling. Does that hurt? One at a time, like your right right knee and your left knee."

260,MSK,doctor,"No, OK, how about when you um flex your knees backwards?"
260,MSK,patient,Nope.
260,MSK,doctor,And kind of point your knees towards the ground.
260,MSK,patient,"No, no pain there."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, so no pain on knee extension or flexion. Um how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?"
260,MSK,patient,Uh no pain there.
260,MSK,doctor,"OK so no pain on plantar flexion, how about when you point your uh toes to the ground?"

260,MSK,patient,"No, no numbness in the groin area."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, so no numbness in the groin area, no weakness, no um changes in your bowel or bladder habits, including no incontinence, so uh no red flags?"
260,MSK,patient,"Yeah, nothing like that."
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK, good um and, OK so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?"
260,MSK,patient,"Uh, no I was just uh yeah, kind of wondering do I do I need any X Rays or like what what what's going on?"
260,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up. Um yeah, did you have any questions or does that sound like an OK plan?"
260,MSK,patient,Uh that sounds like a good plan.
260,MSK,doctor,"OK, sounds good, thank you."
261,RES,doctor,What brings you in today?
261,RES,patient,"I can't, I can barely breathe for like 2 days now and I've been coughing and been having like a little bit of pain in my chest."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, the pain in your chest, uh can you point point out or can you describe the pain to me, is that sharp or is it dull?"
261,RES,patient,"Um, it's hard to say, I haven't really had this before. Um, it's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when I cough and when I if I take like a really deep breath, it will hurt, yeah. Does that make sense?"
261,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so the shortness of breath and chest pain, they occurred simultaneously right? On the same day, like 2 days ago?"
261,RES,patient,"Yeah, I mean now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that. But when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more the pain."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, alright so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?"
261,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I haven't noticed any blood."
261,RES,doctor,OK. And how about sputum?
261,RES,patient,"I guess I guess it feels like there's some like mucus, I don't know kind, kind of like spit looking, but maybe like thicker than that."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, is it yellow?"
261,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah well yeah, it's creamy yellow."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, sure, and are you wheezing with the cough?"
261,RES,patient,I I don't think so.
261,RES,doctor,"No, OK, um and is it is your shortness of breath worse with exertion?"
261,RES,patient,"I haven't been doing much really 'cause I've just been so wiped out. Um, till probably I guess it's kind of, I'm really, you know, haven't been getting up very much. I'm normally really active like I I train for triathlons and I I'm not like a couch potato, right? And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down."
261,RES,doctor,"OK. Um, do you have the chest pain at rest as well, or is it just with the coughing?"
261,RES,patient,"Like if I take a deep breath I'll have it. But no, I don't think not not like right now. Not like just sitting here."
261,RES,doctor,"OK. And the coughing, how often are you coughing?"
261,RES,patient,"Oh, like it kind of varies. I feel like I get up in the night kind of sweaty and I'll cough for for a while. And it it'll keep me up, and then during the day, it's like I might go, you know, a couple hours without, but then I'll cough and I'll kind of keep going for a few minutes so, it's a lot, like probably, yeah, I probably don't go more than like 2 hours without."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And how far can you walk before you start feeling shortness of breath?"
261,RES,patient,"I mean, I haven't been walking very far. Like I I walked in here from the parking lot and that was fine, but I'm tired."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, and I just want to ask you some other questions. Um, Jessica, so have you had any fevers race recently?"
261,RES,patient,"I don't actually have a thermometer at home that works, but I like I said, when I've been getting up in the night coughing, I've been like really hot and sweaty. Kinda gross like feel like I just I feel like soaked and but yeah, I don't have a thermometer."
261,RES,doctor,"Um, OK, so these night events that you're describing, are they more chills or night sweats?"
261,RES,patient,"Well, I don't know, it just feels like when you know when you're, I don't like when you're a kid and you get really sick and your parent tells you have fever like I don't have an actual temperature."
261,RES,doctor,But do you feel hot?
261,RES,patient,"I feel hot, yeah."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And have you lost any weight recently?"
261,RES,patient,"No, I mean I'd like to, but no, no."
261,RES,doctor,OK and any changes in your vision?
261,RES,patient,"Uh, no."
261,RES,doctor,Hearing?

261,RES,patient,No.
261,RES,doctor,"Any, do you have like a stuffy nose? Runny nose?"
261,RES,patient,Maybe a little little bit. It's been more the coughing that's that's bothered me. So I haven't thought that much about it.
261,RES,doctor,"OK, sorry you said your nose was stuffy or runny?"
261,RES,patient,"So it's a little stuffy, maybe a little."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, OK um, and have you had any like pressure behind your eyes in your head?"

261,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're tired, do you feel weak at all like you can't move a certain limb?"
261,RES,patient,"Oh no, that that's all fine."
261,RES,doctor,"That's all fine, OK?"
261,RES,patient,I haven't like wiped out like I said.
261,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, um do you get this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when you're laying down?"
261,RES,patient,"I mean, I've mostly been laying down lately, um, so yeah, like I kinda have it all the time."
261,RES,doctor,"All the time? OK, but it's not worse when you're laying down or standing up?"
261,RES,patient,"Don't think it's worse, no."
261,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you noticed any swelling?"
261,RES,patient,"Um, I don't think so, no."

262,RES,patient,"Um no, not that I know of."
262,RES,doctor,"Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?"
262,RES,patient,"No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this."
262,RES,doctor,"OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well."
262,RES,patient,"OK, sounds good."
263,RES,doctor,So can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in here today?
263,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days. A little bit worried. Wanna talk to someone."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, so started two days ago."
263,RES,patient,"No about what day is it today? Today is Wednesday. It started on Sunday, Sunday. I noticed it getting really bad."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, so it got really bad. Then it was it was it still present but not as bad before that?"
263,RES,patient,Yeah I think I had like a bit of like a raspy cough on like Friday but Sunday it was when I started getting nervous about it.
263,RES,doctor,"OK so almost a week, it sounds like. And what exactly changed on Sunday that you made it worse in your opinion?"
263,RES,patient,So Sunday I started bringing I noticed like little spots of red kind of the the gunk I was bringing up.
263,RES,doctor,OK.
263,RES,patient,"And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know."
263,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?"
263,RES,patient,"Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, it’s got like well spots are red on it on Sunday."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, and before that did you have like the yellow custard without red? Or it all started at once all kind of started?"
263,RES,patient,It all started at once to be honest.
263,RES,doctor,"Sorry, I know these are tricky questions, and you said that you've had some fevers. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When did that start?"
263,RES,patient,"So that started, the Monday really is when I first started. I never took my temperature. I just felt hot. You know that's been going on pretty much until today."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, did you ever feel like you were really shaky?"
263,RES,patient,"Yeah, I've been getting the chills, especially last two days."
263,RES,doctor,"OK. So over this time you've had this cough, have you felt like you've had difficulty breathing?"
263,RES,patient,"Not really, I feel a little bit winded doing things. I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse."
263,RES,patient,"Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy."
263,RES,doctor,OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?
263,RES,patient,No.
263,RES,doctor,Has anything helped it to feel better at all?
263,RES,patient,Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while.
263,RES,doctor,So you kind of just clear it up and that feels a little bit better?
263,RES,patient,"Yeah, I haven't taken some Tylenol at home and that helps a little bit."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, have you felt a sore throat at the same time?"
263,RES,patient,"After an awful lot of coughing, yeah, it starts to feel a little raw."
263,RES,doctor,Have you had a runny nose?
263,RES,patient,"Yeah, bit of 1 back in the day, maybe a week ago, but that kind of gone away by now."
263,RES,doctor,Have you felt any chest pain?
263,RES,patient,Yeah. Yeah I got pain kinda on the right.
263,RES,doctor,OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?
263,RES,patient,"No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad."
263,RES,doctor,"OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?"
263,RES,patient,It's kind of always there. It gets a little bit worse with coughing and when I take a pretty big deep breath.
263,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK, but if you were just laying down, not coughing, is that pain there?"
263,RES,patient,"Yeah yeah, specially notice over the last day,"
263,RES,doctor,OK.

264,RES,patient,I’m going to school and they're doing these half days.
264,RES,doctor,"OK. OK uhm, and has anyone in your school been sick?"
264,RES,patient,"Ah, Nope, not recently."
264,RES,doctor,At least not that we know of. OK.
264,RES,patient,No.
264,RES,doctor,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"
264,RES,patient,"No. I've been pretty healthy otherwise. I've never had like I've never had like a dry cough like this. I've had runny nose in the past, but they never lasted this long."
264,RES,doctor,"OK, have you ever been in the hospital?"
264,RES,patient,No.
264,RES,doctor,OK. Did you see your family doctor for anything? Any health problems?
264,RES,patient,"No, no."
264,RES,doctor,Do you take any medicines?
264,RES,patient,No.
264,RES,doctor,"OK. This may be a tricky one to answer, so Mom can definitely help us. Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?"
264,RES,patient,"Um uh his grandparents had um asthma, but he's been worked up for that and he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity. So yeah, so he doesn't have that."
264,RES,doctor,And what else?
264,RES,patient,Pardon me.
264,RES,doctor,I said just some some asthma in the family.
264,RES,patient,Yeah.
264,RES,doctor,"OK. And so you live, you live with your mom. Do you live with anyone else in your family?"
264,RES,patient,I have a four year old sister.
264,RES,doctor,"OK, do you live with your dad too?"
264,RES,patient,Yes.
264,RES,doctor,Do you guys have any pets?
264,RES,patient,"Um no, no pets."
264,RES,doctor,And does anyone smoke in the home?
264,RES,patient,"Nope, no."
264,RES,doctor,"OK, and what do you like to do for fun?"
264,RES,patient,"Um I like playing with my friends, I like playing video games."
264,RES,doctor,Oh cool. So what's your favorite game?
264,RES,patient,I am playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.
264,RES,doctor,"Oh cool, that sounds like fun. OK well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of roller coaster Tycoon. So I’m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?"
264,RES,patient,"I don't think so, no."
264,RES,doctor,Do you know what an X Ray is?
264,RES,patient,"A little bit, yeah."
264,RES,doctor,"Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?"
264,RES,patient,OK.
264,RES,doctor,So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
264,RES,patient,"OK, that sounds good."
264,RES,doctor,Thank you guys for chatting with me.
264,RES,patient,"Yeah, thank you."
264,RES,doctor,Thanks.
265,RES,doctor,"I'm going to be having a chat with you today get an idea of how things are going and then I'll go over it with the opposition that I'm working with and we can come back together and talk to you about the next steps, that sound good to you?"
265,RES,patient,Yeah.
265,RES,doctor,I know that you've been having experiencing a cough. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
265,RES,patient,"Yeah, I um I've had this cough for the past two weeks and it just doesn't go."
265,RES,doctor,OK. have never had anything like this before?
265,RES,patient,"I’m I usually get a cold once a year or so. But the cough doesn't last this long, like it's usually over in a week or week and a half or so."
265,RES,doctor,Mm. And it's it's not letting up.
265,RES,patient,Mm.
265,RES,doctor,OK um. I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the cough itself. Is this a dry cough that you're experiencing? Or are you producing like any any mucus or coughing up anything?
265,RES,patient,"There was some mucus um earlier on, but now it's it's all, it’s a dry cough."
265,RES,doctor,"Now, it's dry OK how long, what was the timeline for that? I guess how long?"
265,RES,patient,"Yeah, so maybe for the first four or five days there was this like whitish clear kind of mucus that was coming up and then after that was a a dry cough."
265,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. And do you feel like the intensity of the cough got worse over the last two weeks, or has it gotten any better?"
265,RES,patient,"Kind of the same, I would say."
265,RES,doctor,And has the cough gotten more frequent over this time as well?
265,RES,patient,No.
265,RES,doctor,How often would you say that you're coughing?
265,RES,patient,"Uhm? It's hard for me to quantify, maybe a couple of times an hour, maybe three or four times an hour or so."
265,RES,doctor,"Is there anything you can think of that triggers the cough, or is it spontaneous?"
265,RES,patient,"It’s kinda, spontaneous um. Can't really think of anything."
265,RES,doctor,"OK. And along with the cough, are you experiencing any difficulty breathing?"
265,RES,patient,No.
265,RES,doctor,"OK, have you noticed any fevers?"
265,RES,patient,"Uhm, no."
265,RES,doctor,OK um. Have you had any sore throat?
265,RES,patient,Um I did initially um for the first two or three days and then that got better.
265,RES,doctor,OK um. Have you had any runny nose?
265,RES,patient,"I did initially yeah, I have like had all those flu symptoms for the first couple of days, but the cough just kinda stayed. Everything else resolved in the first uhm three or four days I would say."
265,RES,doctor,"OK. Thank you for sharing that have you had, did you have any chest pain at any point?"
265,RES,patient,"No, but I guess like sometimes when I'm coughing too much my chest hurts a little bit."
265,RES,doctor,"OK, so it feels kind of sore after all that?"
265,RES,patient,Yeah.
265,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, have you been in contact, I guess it's hard to say because it started a while ago, but before it started bringing contact with anyone that's been sick?"
265,RES,patient,"I I work at the hospital, but. Um I'm wearing PPE all the time, and I'm very careful so."
265,RES,doctor,OK. Have you traveled anywhere outside of the province?
265,RES,patient,No.
265,RES,doctor,"OK, have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
265,RES,patient,No.
265,RES,doctor,"OK, any belly pain?"
265,RES,patient,"Uhm, no."
265,RES,doctor,"OK, um so I'm just gonna ask you some questions about your overall health. Have you had any respiratory problems in the past?"
265,RES,patient,No.
265,RES,doctor,OK. Or do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for regular thing?
265,RES,patient,"I’ve got acid reflux and uh, I also have anxiety."
265,RES,doctor,Are you currently taking any medications?
265,RES,patient,"Um. I I used to, not anymore."
265,RES,doctor,"Uh, was there any particular medication that you stopped recently?"
265,RES,patient,"No, no. I used to take. I used to take something for anxiety two three years ago."
265,RES,doctor,OK. And what do you do for your reflux?
265,RES,patient,"I just avoid right now, I'm just trying to avoid the foods that make things worse for me and I feel like that's helped me quite a bit, uhm so yeah. I quite like acidic foods and chocolates and things like that."
265,RES,doctor,Sure. That's no fun.
265,RES,patient,Yeah.
265,RES,doctor,Do you have any allergies?

265,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, and what do you do for work?"
265,RES,patient,I’m a clerk at the hospital.
265,RES,doctor,"OK. Right, you just say you working at the hospital. And, uh. I can't think I thought I had another question for you, but I can't remember it. Anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you."
265,RES,patient,"Um. No, I guess I was just wondering why I still have a cough. It's been such a long time. Um yeah, and I was wondering if I could get any medications just to help with that. It's not really. Yeah, it's everyone's like scared at work when I cough. I have. I have had the covid test and I don't have it, um so yeah."
265,RES,doctor,When we got the last test done?
265,RES,patient,"Um I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago? Since then I've been at home and I'm just waiting for my symptoms to get better, but I you know, I kind of like get back, and I don't want to be coughing when I get back. Um yeah."
265,RES,doctor,"OK. Well, I'm gonna have a quick listen to your heart and lungs I'll do a quick physical exam and then I will go get the doctor that I'm working with all kind of go over everything you talked about, and then we'll come back and talk to you about where to go from here."

266,RES,doctor,And I gotta ask this question for everyone. Have you ever injected drugs or anything into your arm or your body?
266,RES,patient,No.
266,RES,doctor,"OK. Alright, thanks Jessica. So just to summarize, you kind of had a three to four day dry cough with a little bit of fever, some headache, and just in terms was quickly reviewing then. So you have been bringing anything up. No one in contact with these recently been sick. You don't have asthma, your not taking any medications aside from Claritin, and your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold and we're hoping to get out of this visit is just kind of next steps and where to go from here, correct?"
266,RES,patient,"Yeah, like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something."
266,RES,doctor,OK. Alright perfect Thank you very much. You have any more questions?
266,RES,patient,"No, I don't know. I don't have any more questions. I just like I can go home soon like lay down."
266,RES,doctor,"Sounds good, thanks Jessica."
267,RES,doctor,I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?"
267,RES,patient,Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?"
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?"
267,RES,patient,"If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?"
267,RES,patient,"Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?"
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, mostly just with the cat."
267,RES,doctor,OK.
267,RES,patient,"We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and have you had a cough?"
267,RES,patient,"Uh, no, I don't think so."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?"
267,RES,patient,"Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, how many days per week are you using that?"
267,RES,patient,"Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an ""s"", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?"
267,RES,patient,"Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said."
267,RES,doctor,OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?
267,RES,patient,Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?
267,RES,doctor,"Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?"
267,RES,patient,"When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times."
267,RES,doctor,OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?
267,RES,patient,When I was a kid but not really now.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?"
267,RES,patient,No.
267,RES,doctor,OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?
267,RES,patient,"Ahh, I don't I don't think so."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, any urinary problems?"
267,RES,patient,"Uh, like. No, no."
267,RES,doctor,OK. Bowel problems?
267,RES,patient,"uh no, no. No, that's all good."
267,RES,doctor,"OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?"
267,RES,patient,No.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?"
267,RES,patient,What's that?
267,RES,doctor,"So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating."
267,RES,patient,Oh no.
267,RES,doctor,OK.
267,RES,patient,Um not that.
267,RES,doctor,"OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?"
267,RES,patient,"No, no that's it."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?"
267,RES,patient,Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and any surgeries?"
267,RES,patient,Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?"
267,RES,patient,"Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and any allergies?"
267,RES,patient,"What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy"
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime."
267,RES,doctor,"OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?"
267,RES,patient,"I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?"
267,RES,patient,"You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother."
267,RES,doctor,OK.
267,RES,patient,Yeah.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and um, where do you go to school?"
267,RES,patient,"Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road."
267,RES,doctor,OK and in what grade now?
267,RES,patient,"And, I'm in Grade 11."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?"
267,RES,patient,"I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?"
267,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?"
267,RES,patient,"Uh, what is that?"
267,RES,doctor,"So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device."
267,RES,patient,Is that like when you breathe in that the tube?
267,RES,doctor,"Yeah, exactly."
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back."
267,RES,doctor,"OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?"
267,RES,patient,"I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?"
267,RES,patient,Sorry I missed that.
267,RES,doctor,Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?
267,RES,patient,"Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you currently sexually active?"
267,RES,patient,"Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you use a condom?"
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah."
267,RES,doctor,Every time or sometimes?
267,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, great and um have you had any other partners?"
267,RES,patient,"No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"
267,RES,patient,Uh no.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?"
267,RES,patient,No.
267,RES,doctor,OK.
267,RES,patient,No I haven't.
267,RES,doctor,"OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?"
267,RES,patient,"Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now."
267,RES,doctor,"OK, and any allergies that run in the family?"
267,RES,patient,"Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies."
267,RES,doctor,"OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma."
267,RES,patient,"Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that."
267,RES,doctor,Excellent.
267,RES,patient,K thank you.
268,RES,patient,"Hi, I'm Rob and I just feel like I can't catch my breath."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, how old are you Rob?"
268,RES,patient,I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, when did this start?"
268,RES,patient,"Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in."
268,RES,doctor,"Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?"
268,RES,patient,"Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp."
268,RES,doctor,OK.
268,RES,patient,I have never had anything like this before.
268,RES,doctor,"No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?"
268,RES,patient,"Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like..."
268,RES,doctor,"Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead."
268,RES,patient,Maybe like you know five or six.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?"
268,RES,patient,Yeah.
268,RES,doctor,Yeah?
268,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's like it's like sharp."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, sorry, sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?"
268,RES,patient,No no.
268,RES,doctor,No? You're not coughing up any blood?
268,RES,patient,No.
268,RES,doctor,Any swelling in your legs?
268,RES,patient,I I don't think so.
268,RES,doctor,"No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?"
268,RES,patient,"Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, how about when you're laying down?"
268,RES,patient,"I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy..."
268,RES,doctor,OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?
268,RES,patient,I don't think so.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, how about fevers or chills?"
268,RES,patient,"No, not that I've noticed, no."
268,RES,doctor,OK. Any abdominal pain?
268,RES,patient,"Uh, no, no, it's like it aches kind of it, but it's all up here and like kind of in my back a little bit."
268,RES,doctor,"OK and, do you think anything triggered this?"
268,RES,patient,I don't know.
268,RES,doctor,"No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?"
268,RES,patient,"Right, yeah."
268,RES,doctor,Does it get better with you sitting forward?
268,RES,patient,"I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much."
268,RES,doctor,"OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?"
268,RES,patient,No.
268,RES,doctor,No? Any rashes?
268,RES,patient,No.
268,RES,doctor,No? Weight loss?
268,RES,patient,"I, I mean, I've been trying to to lose weight."
268,RES,doctor,OK.
268,RES,patient,They told me a year ago I have like high blood pressure so I've been cutting out like salt and trying to walk more.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, OK, good."
268,RES,patient,So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?"
268,RES,patient,"No, just like a I can't get like a good breath."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?"
268,RES,patient,"No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems."
268,RES,doctor,"OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?"
268,RES,patient,"No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're not on any medications?"
268,RES,patient,"No, just yeah, no that's it. I mean I, you know sometimes take like a Tylenol if I'm"
268,RES,doctor,And do you smoke?
268,RES,patient,"I, like I, smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week."
268,RES,doctor,"A pack a week, OK? For how long?"
268,RES,patient,Oh like since college.
268,RES,doctor,"OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?"
268,RES,patient,"Uh. No, no and I I smoke, I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I used to smoke a little more but this is this is less but not since I've been having trouble breathing. Is it, yeah."
268,RES,doctor,"Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?"
268,RES,patient,No no.
268,RES,doctor,"No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"
268,RES,patient,"Oh like, maybe you know, a beer on the weekend."
268,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"
268,RES,patient,Like I don't I think I got all the ones when I was like a kid. What else should I have?
268,RES,doctor,"OK, so like the flu vaccine every year?"
268,RES,patient,"Oh, I get that, like my wife, my wife makes me get that."
268,RES,doctor,OK that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?
268,RES,patient,"Oh like my, uh, my mom and dad have high blood pressure too, so I wasn't surprised when I heard that I did."
268,RES,doctor,"OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?"
268,RES,patient,"I am really like nervous 'cause I haven't felt anything like this before. Um, like it's scary, like do you think it's like cancer or something like I don't I don't really know?"
268,RES,doctor,"Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?"
268,RES,patient,Mhm.
268,RES,doctor,"Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know? And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?"
268,RES,patient,"Yeah yeah, I just really want to get a good breath so yeah, whatever we can do."
268,RES,doctor,"Yeah for sure, and then in the meantime we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are OK and if we need to give you oxygen, we will."
268,RES,patient,That'd be great.
268,RES,doctor,"OK, thank you."
269,MSK,doctor,What brings you in?
269,MSK,patient,I've um I've been having this numbness and tingling and I guess kind of burning sensation that well uh it's been happening more often in my uh left hand.
269,MSK,doctor,"On your left hand, OK. And sorry when did you say this started?"
269,MSK,patient,Uh it's been going on for probably four or five months um.
269,MSK,doctor,OK.
269,MSK,patient,"Yeah, it first uh it would only bug me for a couple of minutes at a time and I could kind of shake my hand out, like flick like flick my wrist and um and it would go away after a few minutes. But now I'm starting to get uh like symptoms at night sometimes as well."

269,MSK,patient,It comes and goes.
269,MSK,doctor,OK and what makes it better or worse?
269,MSK,patient,"Uh better uh I've tried some um Advil um and Tylenol and it's kind of the, hasn't done much um for the pain really, uh I think only the thing that kind of helps it is just not using it as much, um yeah."
269,MSK,doctor,"Yeah, alright, um have you tried any like cold compresses, um topical creams? Anything like that?"
269,MSK,patient,No.
269,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. And uhm if you were to describe the quality of how it feels like, does it does it, is it painful, is it tender, or is it just numb and tingling, kind of like when your foot goes to sleep?"
269,MSK,patient,"Uh I guess I have, it is a bit painful as well, yeah. I have um like a burning kind of pain."
269,MSK,doctor,"OK and 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is this pain?"
269,MSK,patient,"Uh when it gets to its worst, I would say about a 6."

269,MSK,doctor,"OK, alright good, um so now we're just going to move on to the physical exam part um of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to look at both your arms, hands, and wrists, um side by side. Does your left one seem at all more red, swollen, uh or hot."
269,MSK,patient,"No, no symptoms like that."
269,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. And um do you, does that one seem to be more atrophied or are there any deformities or skin changes on that one?"
269,MSK,patient,"Um maybe uh a little less muscle bulk on the, like where my thumb is."
269,MSK,doctor,"OK, OK. Um and then I'm gonna get you to palpate certain areas of that arm. So let's start um at the top, when you when you press down on your shoulder blades or just at the very top of your um arm where your, or at the very top where your arm connects to your shoulder, does it hurt over there?"
269,MSK,patient,"No, no pain there."
269,MSK,doctor,OK. So no pain on the acromion process or the scapula. Um any pain where your biceps are?
269,MSK,patient,No.
269,MSK,doctor,"No, OK. How about at your elbows?"
269,MSK,patient,"Uh no pain at the elbows and full, I can move my elbows and shoulders, uh no problem either. And my neck doesn't hurt at all either, I can move my neck around."
269,MSK,doctor,"How about when you um palpate your wrists, both sides, medial and lateral?"
269,MSK,patient,"Uh, yeah no, no pain if I'm just pressing or palpating the wrist."
269,MSK,doctor,"OK. Um and I'm going to get you to um straighten out your arm and flex at your shoulder and extend at your shoulder, does that hurt?"
269,MSK,patient,No.
269,MSK,doctor,How about when you flex your elbow and extend your elbow?
269,MSK,patient,No.
269,MSK,doctor,Um how about when you flex your wrist and extend your wrist?
269,MSK,patient,No.
269,MSK,doctor,"OK, so I'm going to do a special test for something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um so um I'm gonna get you to straighten out your left arm again um and right where um alright, how do we do this? OK, so with your right hand or with your yeah, with your right index finger and middle finger, you're going to tap um just below uh where the bulk of your thumb muscles are um connecting to your wrist. I'm just going to get you to tap that area. Do you feel tingling like an electric shock sensation in your hand or anything like that."
269,MSK,patient,"I do, yeah."
269,MSK,doctor,"You do, OK, so that's a positive Tinel's sign. Um and then we're going to do one more test, so I'm going to, OK so make like a prayer motion with your hands like um putting your 2 palms together and then um and then instead invert your hand so that the outer parts are touching and your fingers are pointing towards the ground."
269,MSK,patient,OK.
269,MSK,doctor,"So kind of like upside down but with your outer parts of your hands touching. Um and then I'm going to get you to uh just hold your arms like that um for about 60 seconds. Do you feel any tingling, numbness, or pain in those fingers?"
269,MSK,patient,"Yeah, I get a bit of uh numbness and tingling when when I do that."
269,MSK,doctor,"OK, so that's a positive Phalen's sign test. Um alright, so that brings me to the end of um this interview, did you have any questions or concerns, anything that you wanted to bring up?"
269,MSK,patient,Uh just wondering about um what this could be.
269,MSK,doctor,"Oh yeah, so um it seems like you have something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um and that is, it's pretty common um so it can be caused by um a lot of things, but basically your median nerve runs through your forearm into your wrist, and anything that squeezes or irritates that median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, um and some things include um like repetitive movements at work, um obesity, um any nerve damaging conditions like diabetes, um inflammatory conditions, but mostly just like workplace factors can can do it, um especially if you're working with like vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires like repetitive and prolonged flexing of the wrist. Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms. Uh you can take some NSAIDs to relieve pain, um and if those don't work, we can try corticosteroids, um and if that doesn't work, then we can also discuss surgery sometime down the line. Does that sound OK?"
269,MSK,patient,"It does, yeah, thank you."
269,MSK,doctor,Yeah no problem.
270,RES,doctor,How may I help you?

270,RES,patient,"No, I've just been visiting him and I just go grocery shopping. I've just I've been doing schooling online. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm usually very careful, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not maintaining social distancing with my boyfriend. He's in my social circle, but yeah, other than that no one I think yeah."
270,RES,doctor,Ok. And have you traveled anywhere?
270,RES,patient,No.
270,RES,doctor,Alright then are you currently working or going to school?
270,RES,patient,I'm going to school.

270,RES,patient,"Oh yeah. Yeah, he has this cute little parrot. And he also has a cat."
270,RES,doctor,"OK, and do you have any pets at your house?"
270,RES,patient,"No, no I don't."
270,RES,doctor,"Oh, OK. So that I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on on history today, was there anything else I forgot to mention or you wanted to to bring up?"
270,RES,patient,"I don't think so, no."
270,RES,doctor,"OK, so it sounds like there's potentially could be caused by an allergen such as which could be   from an animal like a parrot or a cat that is causing just a reaction and it's bringing these symptoms on like called hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but also we can't rule out asthma as well as being a trigger of kind of the cough and shortness of breath is being around allergens as well, so we'll order pulmonary function test, and maybe some, uh, uh, imaging and chest x-ray and we will go from there."
270,RES,patient,"Great, thank you."
271,RES,doctor,What brings you in?
271,RES,patient,"I've just had a real like a real bad cough. Umm, it's been going on for 4 or 5 days now umm, and I'm just, I'm having some trouble breathing. I'm coughing up like gunky green stuff. Uhm, yeah, it's just really bad. I haven't had anything like this before."
271,RES,doctor,"OK, so when did the cough start?"
271,RES,patient,About four or five days ago.
271,RES,doctor,"Four or five days ago. OK, and, uhm OK. So for 5 days, did you do have any shortness of breath with that?"
271,RES,patient,"Yeah, it's uh, I'm just I feel like I can't, can't quite like breathe fully."
271,RES,doctor,"OK, uhm you can't quite breathe fully, so like when you take a deep breath in, you can't expand your lungs fully. Is that what you mean?"
271,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I just overall I just feel like yeah, I'm I'm short of breath. I guess that's the best way to put it."
271,RES,doctor,"OK, so you're short of breath. And how about wheezing? Do you have any of that?"
271,RES,patient,I don't think so.
271,RES,doctor,OK. So when did this start again? You said if a couple days ago or a few weeks ago.
271,RES,patient,I think it was four days ago.
271,RES,doctor,"Four days ago, OK, and did you have like a runny nose or stuffy nose at that point?"
271,RES,patient,Maybe a little bit. I wasn't really thinking about it too much.

271,RES,patient,"Just that one for the reflux its uhm oh, it starts with an R. Uhm, Rabeprazole?"

271,RES,doctor,"OK, sure."
271,RES,patient,"So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time."
271,RES,doctor,"Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?"
271,RES,patient,"Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything."
271,RES,doctor,"OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?"
271,RES,patient,"No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside."
271,RES,doctor,"OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?"
271,RES,patient,"No, no"
271,RES,doctor,"No, OK. Dietary wise, are you like eating healthy?"
271,RES,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I think so. I try to, you know, cook, you know, whole foods for us like lots of veggies and you know fish and good meat. Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do."
271,RES,doctor,OK.
271,RES,patient,"Otherwise, I think we pretty healthy I try to, you know, follow healthy recipes and find them online."
271,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's good. Do you, do you smoke?"

271,RES,doctor,OK. Do you drink alcohol?
271,RES,patient,"I'll have the occasional glass of wine on a special occasion, but not frequently and not, not heavily."
271,RES,doctor,OK. And where do you live and who do you live with right now?
271,RES,patient,"Uh, just me and my husband. We live outside of town. We live in the country on a little farm."
271,RES,doctor,"OK. Any old carpets or dust or mold or asbestos in the, in the home?"
271,RES,patient,"No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything."
271,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?"
271,RES,patient,I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.
271,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?"
271,RES,patient,"Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on."
271,RES,doctor,"Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet."
271,RES,patient,"OK, OK, that's good to hear."
271,RES,doctor,"Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you."
271,RES,patient,"OK, thank you."
272,RES,doctor,What brings you here today?
272,RES,patient,"Um hi, yeah I've had the stuffy nose um that's been on and off, as well as a runny nose for the past week and it doesn't seem to be getting any better, so I thought I should come in and get it checked out in case I have covid."
272,RES,doctor,"OK, yeah I know for sure that's a good idea. So how long have you had this for?"
272,RES,patient,A week now.
272,RES,doctor,A week. And did. So what started first? Was it the runny nose? Or like the stuffiness?
272,RES,patient,"It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running."
272,RES,doctor,"OK, and are you coughing at all?"
272,RES,patient,No.
272,RES,doctor,"No OK, and the runny nose what kind of content are you producing or draining? Is it mainly like clear or is there any color to it?"
272,RES,patient,It's mostly clear.

272,RES,doctor,"OK. OK, and have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"
272,RES,patient,"Uhm? No, I don't think so. My I have um a nephew who I live with who goes to daycare."

272,RES,doctor,"Yeah, it kind of so just a stuffy nose in the runny nose it seems like it's most likely a viral infection like the common cold. It takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved, but there's not much that we can do besides supportive care, so make sure you get you stay well hydrated. You can use over the counter medications uh like Tylenol cold. now, if you to relieve some of your symptoms, but since right now we're in a pandemic, some of these symptoms can also be seen in covid patients, so we will also get a swab done for you today, and you should have the results back by 48 hours. Um until then, we recommend that you stay isolated in your own home and not see anyone else. And then once the results come back, you'll get further instructions from public health."
