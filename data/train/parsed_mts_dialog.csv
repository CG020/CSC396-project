1,GENHX,doctor,"What brings you back into the clinic today, miss?"
1,GENHX,patient,I came in for a refill of my blood pressure medicine.
1,GENHX,doctor,"It looks like Doctor Kumar followed up with you last time regarding your hypertension, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, allergic rhinitis and kidney stones.  Have you noticed any changes or do you have any concerns regarding these issues?"
1,GENHX,patient,No.
1,GENHX,doctor,"Have you had any fever or chills, cough, congestion, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, chest pressure?"
1,GENHX,patient,No.
1,GENHX,doctor,"Great. Also, for our records, how old are you and what race do you identify yourself as?"
1,GENHX,patient,I am seventy six years old and identify as a white female.
2,GENHX,doctor,How're you feeling today?
2,GENHX,patient,Terrible. I'm having the worst headache of my life.
2,GENHX,doctor,"I'm so sorry. Well you are only twenty five, so let's hope this is the last of the worst. Let's see how we can best help you. When did it start?"
2,GENHX,patient,Around eleven in the morning.
2,GENHX,doctor,Today?
2,GENHX,patient,Um no yesterday. July thirty first.
2,GENHX,doctor,July thirty first O eight. Got it. Did it come on suddenly?
2,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
2,GENHX,doctor,"Are you having any symptoms with it, such as blurry vision, light sensitivity, dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea?"
2,GENHX,patient,I'm having blurry vision and lightheadedness.  I also can't seem to write well. It looks so messy. I am naturally right handed but my writing looks like I am trying with my left.
2,GENHX,doctor,How would you describe the lightheadedness?
2,GENHX,patient,Like there are blind spots.
2,GENHX,doctor,Okay. How about any vomiting?
2,GENHX,patient,Um no. I feel like my face is pretty swollen though. I don't know if it's related to the headache but it started around the same time.
2,GENHX,doctor,"Here in the E R, we'll do a thorough exam and eval to make sure nothing serious is going on. While we're waiting for your C T results, I'm going to order a migraine cocktail and some Morphine."
2,GENHX,patient,Thank. Will the nurse be in soon?
2,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, she'll be right in as soon as the order is placed. It shouldn't be more than a few minutes. If it takes longer, then please ring the call bell."
3,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. What is the reason for your visit today?"
3,GENHX,patient,I think I have some warts on my back end where the poop comes out.
3,GENHX,doctor,I see. When did you start noticing them?
3,GENHX,patient,I think like three to four weeks ago.
3,GENHX,doctor,Do you feel any pain or discomfort?
3,GENHX,patient,"It itches a little, but I haven't felt any pain yet. Is this normal for a twenty two year old?"
3,GENHX,doctor,"I'll have to take a look, but you'll be fine. Are there any other symptoms that you are aware of?"
3,GENHX,patient,Nope. Just the warts and itchiness.
4,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you taking any over the counter medicines?
4,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, only the ones which were prescribed."
4,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"No alternative medicine, naturopathy or anything?"
4,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, only whatever is here in this prescription."
4,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay let me take a look...so you were prescribed Salmeterol inhaler-
4,MEDICATIONS,patient,On as needed basis.
4,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Okay and the other one is Fluticasone inhaler, which is-"
4,MEDICATIONS,patient,Which is a nasal inhaler.
4,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Right.
5,CC,doctor,"Hi, how are you?"
5,CC,patient,I burned my hand.
5,CC,doctor,"Oh, I am sorry. Wow!"
5,CC,patient,Yeah.
5,CC,doctor,Is it only right arm?
5,CC,patient,Yes.
6,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How's your asthma since you started using your inhaler again?
6,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Much better. I don't know why I didn't take it with me everywhere I went.
6,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"It's important to carry it with you, especially during times where you're exercising or walking more than usual."
6,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yeah. I think I've learned my lesson.
6,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Besides asthma, do you have any other medical problems?"
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I quit before I had my daughter."
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you currently pregnant?
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I'm not."
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Did you have any complications with the birth of your daughter?
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I actually had a C section.
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you had any other surgeries in the past?

7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No.
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Are there any problems with the lungs, thyroid, kidney, or bladder?"
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No.
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, how long ago did you hurt your lower back?"
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"It was about four or five years ago now, when I was in a car crash."
7,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What kind of treatments were recommended?
7,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"They didn't recommend P T, and I didn't really have any increased back pain after the accident."
8,ALLERGY,doctor,Any know drug allergies?
8,ALLERGY,patient,No.
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hi there, sir! How are you today?"
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hello! I am good.
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I would like to start with your family medical history today. What do you know about their medical history?
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My mother and father both had heart disease. Well, my mother had complication from her heart disease and that is how she passed.  My father was only in his forty's when he died."
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry the hear that.
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you. I have two brothers, one whom I don't speak to very much anymore. I don't know if he has any health problems. My other brother is healthy with no issues. Both my uncles on my mother's side had polio, I think."
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me more about your uncles with polio. They both had polio?
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,One of them had to wear crutches due to how bad his leg deformans were and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  I am fairly certain that they had polio.
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of any other family member with neurological conditions?
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. None that I know of.
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any children?
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I have one child.
9,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is your child healthy and well?
9,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
10,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Can you tell me about any diseases that run in your family?
10,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sure, my brother has a prostate cancer."
10,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, brother."
10,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My father had brain cancer.
10,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, dad."
10,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Then on both sides of my family there are many heart related issues.
10,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
10,FAM/SOCHX,patient,And my brother and sister both have diabetes.
10,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
10,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, that's it."
11,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am. Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. Before we begin, I just need to confirm some background information on you."
11,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor. Absolutely, that's no problem."
11,GENHX,doctor,"First, how old are you?"
11,GENHX,patient,"I'm nineteen, sir."
11,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and your chart says you identify as Caucasian. Is that correct?"
11,GENHX,patient,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
11,GENHX,doctor,"Great, what seems to be problem today, ma'am?"
11,GENHX,patient,I've had this bunion on my foot for such a long time.
11,GENHX,doctor,How long has this bunion been present?
11,GENHX,patient,"At this point, um, I don't even remember how long it's been."
11,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other conditions that I should be aware of?
11,GENHX,patient,"Actually, yes. I have a history of, um, Charcot Marie tooth disease."
11,GENHX,doctor,"That's good to know, thank you."
11,GENHX,patient,"I would like to have surgery to cut this bunion off, I can't take it anymore."
12,GENHX,doctor,"I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?"
12,GENHX,patient,"I'll be ninety later this month, doctor."
12,GENHX,doctor,You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today?
12,GENHX,patient,"Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended?"
12,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm not taking that right now."
12,GENHX,doctor,How did you tolerate the higher dose?
12,GENHX,patient,"I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose."
12,GENHX,doctor,"That was one M G per day, correct?"
12,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous."
12,GENHX,doctor,"That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please."
12,GENHX,patient,"What is this for, doctor?"
12,GENHX,doctor,"Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs."
12,GENHX,patient,"I can't take these, doctor. They're too big."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?"
12,GENHX,patient,"Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade."
12,GENHX,doctor,Did you have x rays taken today?
12,GENHX,patient,"Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Good, I have the images right here."
12,GENHX,patient,"What do they show, doctor?"
12,GENHX,doctor,"Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury."
12,GENHX,patient,What makes you think there's an injury?
12,GENHX,doctor,"Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here?"
12,GENHX,patient,"No, none."
12,GENHX,doctor,Then we won't worry about it.
12,GENHX,patient,"I am having this stomach pain though, doctor."
12,GENHX,doctor,How has this pain developed and progressed recently?
12,GENHX,patient,"Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore."
12,GENHX,doctor,"What medicines are you taking right now, then?"
12,GENHX,patient,"Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?"
12,GENHX,patient,"No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look?"
12,GENHX,doctor,I see. How long have you worn dentures?
12,GENHX,patient,"Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Do they come and go, the sores?"
12,GENHX,patient,"Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another."
12,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, we'll keep an eye on it."
12,GENHX,patient,"And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms."
12,GENHX,doctor,"It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise?"
12,GENHX,patient,"Yes, we think so."
13,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you talking any medications?
13,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, I don't believe in meds."
13,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Oh really, let me check your list."
13,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yeah never.
13,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Wow amazing.
14,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any past medical history?
14,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Let me see if I can find it in her records.
14,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Does she see a neurologist?
14,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yes, if you could find out that'd be great."
15,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
15,GENHX,patient,I am forty four.
15,GENHX,doctor,Are you right handed or left handed?
15,GENHX,patient,I'm right handed.
15,GENHX,doctor,Tell me what happened.
15,GENHX,patient,I don't know. I woke up over this numbness on my left side of the body. I remember it was on July twenty nineth.
15,GENHX,doctor,Was there any sensation like having pins and needles? Was there any weakness? Is there any change in your visual or mental status? Were you able to walk?
15,GENHX,patient,I was able to walk and there was no weakness or any other thing you mentioned.
15,GENHX,doctor,When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
15,GENHX,patient,"There was nothing around Independence Day. It all started after that. At first, I felt that my right hand is very clumsy, and it is kind of stiff. Then I noticed leaning towards the right when walking. It was strange. Happened around July seventh."
15,GENHX,doctor,Did you recently have any cold or flu like symptoms?
15,GENHX,patient,No.
15,GENHX,doctor,Were diagnosed with a thing called multiple sclerosis?
15,GENHX,patient,No.
15,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever have a feeling where you felt like there's an electric is going up or down your spine?
15,GENHX,patient,No.
15,GENHX,doctor,How about any fatigue or pain? Any frequency in your urination? Any urgency in that?
15,GENHX,patient,No.
16,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"You had a heart surgery, right?"
16,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, that is right."
16,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Pacemaker?
16,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, they did that."
16,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,What else? What other surgeries?
16,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I have had a hysterectomy.
16,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay.
16,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yeah.
17,GENHX,doctor,"How old are you, young boy?"
17,GENHX,patient,I am twenty nine.
17,GENHX,doctor,And you got right side shoulder pain? Is this something new?
17,GENHX,patient,Yes. That is right.
17,GENHX,doctor,What were you doing when this happened?
17,GENHX,patient,"I think I was picking up a stack of cardboard, then putting it down on the ground and twisting to the right side. And sometimes I was throwing them a little bit as well."
17,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and how far you were lifting them or bending?"
17,GENHX,patient,"Around here, till waist level."
17,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
17,GENHX,patient,I heard a pop and since then there is pain in this area. I can't lift heavy items. Basically I have no strength.
17,GENHX,doctor,Okay. And this all started from June thirty two thousand and four?
17,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's right. The pain is in the lateral part of the back of my shoulder."
17,GENHX,doctor,How did you lose your arm if I may ask?
17,GENHX,patient,Motorcycle accident.
18,CC,doctor,When did the nausea and vomiting start?
18,CC,patient,About a few hours ago. I can't seem to stomach anything.
18,CC,doctor,How many episodes of vomiting have you had?
18,CC,patient,At least four.
18,CC,doctor,"Any abdominal pain, fever, chill, or other symptoms?"
18,CC,patient,Just nausea and vomiting. It's been so terrible.
18,CC,doctor,I'll order you some Zofran to help bring the nausea to bay. One moment while I put the order in.
19,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
19,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
19,GENHX,doctor,"Is this your assistant, ma'am?"
19,GENHX,patient,"Yes, she helps me out all day."
19,GENHX,doctor,"Great, do you have your food diary sheets?"
19,GENHX,patient,"Yes, can you give them to her, please?"
19,GENHX,doctor,Thank you. What are you doing for exercise?
19,GENHX,patient,"Um, right now, I walk around at the mall to get my steps in every day."
20,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Is he currently taking any medication?
21,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. I see your last visit was on July two thousand and seven. What was the reason for that visit?"
21,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"My asthma was acting up, and it felt like I couldn't breathe."
21,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have a history of asthma?
21,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Not that I know of, but I know I always get this really bad cough where I cough up some nasty phlegm."
21,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see. I'm looking at your report and it says you have a history of pneumonia.
22,OTHER_HISTORY,doctor,Do you know about any medical traits in your family?
22,OTHER_HISTORY,patient,"No, everyone in my family is quite healthy. I'm not aware of any medical problems."

22,OTHER_HISTORY,patient,"Yes, I am with my boyfriend."
22,OTHER_HISTORY,doctor,Do you take any drugs or alcohol or smoke?
22,OTHER_HISTORY,patient,"No, none of them."
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any past medical history?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Um there were a couple times where I noticed my blood pressure was high but that's improved as of late.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,When did these episodes occur?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,About a year ago.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Did you follow up with your previous doctor?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, my old doctor knows."
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay then. Let's see. Have you been checking your own blood pressure as a result?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No not really.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"It looks like your blood pressure was normal today, which is a good sign."
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Great.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hm any allergies to medications?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,None that I know of.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,And it looks like you have gained about fourteen pounds since last year. Any new diet changes or stressors?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I lost my job last January and it took a pretty big toll on me.
23,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. How have you been coping?
23,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I'm doing better now but I need to watch what I eat. I tend to eat a lot more when I'm stressed. It's something I'm working on.
24,ALLERGY,doctor,Are you allergic to anything?
24,ALLERGY,patient,"Yes, I am allergic to Penicillin."
24,ALLERGY,doctor,Any other drugs that you could be allergic to?

24,ALLERGY,doctor,Okay.
25,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Poor renal sufficiency, possibly due to dehydration or diabetic nephropathy. She also has high blood pressure and low blood sugar as a result of missing meals regularly."
26,ASSESSMENT,patient,Doc what are you going to diagnose me as?
26,ASSESSMENT,doctor,We are looking at blood born pathogen exposure secondary to needlestick.
26,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes, I was also thinking around contamination."
27,CC,doctor,Correct. About two days ago. I believe it was a head on collision.
28,ALLERGY,doctor,Any allergies I should know about?
28,ALLERGY,patient,"Nope, no allergies for me."
29,GENHX,doctor,Hello sir. Let me first start by asking your age. How old are you?
29,GENHX,patient,I'm twenty four.
29,GENHX,doctor,"So, what brought you here? How can I help you?"
29,GENHX,patient,"I was out for fishing this weekend, I think I got into some poison ivy and I have these rashes all over my chest, legs, arms and also some are on my back."
29,GENHX,doctor,You seem so confident of it being poison ivy has it happened before?
29,GENHX,patient,"Oh yes, it has happened several times before. It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection."
29,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let me check my records. It looks like he gave you eighty milligrams of depomedrol. How was it last time after the injection?"
29,GENHX,patient,It worked fine. It did take us some time to get rid of it.
29,GENHX,doctor,Did you take any medicine or anything else this time?
29,GENHX,patient,"I took over the counter Benadryl. Also, I'm applying cortisone cream on the rashes."
29,GENHX,doctor,Did they help you?
29,GENHX,patient,I saw a little bit of improvement. But this weekend it seemed to have been worst.
29,GENHX,doctor,"No worries, let's set you up for another injection."
30,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You had mentioned that cancer runs in your family. What type of cancer?
30,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Skin cancer.
30,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any other health problems in the family?
30,FAM/SOCHX,patient,High blood pressure.
31,CC,doctor,"Hi, what brings you here today?"
31,CC,patient,I feel this lump on the upper side of my breast.
31,CC,doctor,Both sides?
31,CC,patient,"No, only on the left side."
31,CC,doctor,Do you feel it deep inside or on the outer side?
31,CC,patient,Only on the outer side.
32,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I understand that you are new to the clinic. Welcome.
32,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I am new here. I have lived in Arizona for the last four years. I am from Maine. That is where I grow up and most of my family still lives there."
32,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What line of work are you in?
32,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I am a homemaker. I used to clean house, a while back."
32,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have children?
32,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have two children but only one of them is still with us. My oldest son passed away from ulcerative colitis complications three years ago.
32,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry to hear that!
33,CC,doctor,You okay there?
33,CC,patient,"Uh yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to adjust the stretcher."
33,CC,doctor,Want some help?
33,CC,patient,"No, thank you. I think I got it."
33,CC,doctor,So how're you doing?
33,CC,patient,"Fine, but I have this weird lump in my chest."
33,CC,doctor,When did you first notice it?
33,CC,patient,It's been there for a while. I'd say almost half a year.
33,CC,doctor,Have you seen anyone for it?
33,CC,patient,"No, not until now."
33,CC,doctor,Is it causing you pain? And has it changed in size at all?
33,CC,patient,Not really. It's just noticeable when I run my fingers over it.
33,CC,doctor,Have you spotted any swelling or redness to the area? Any drainage?
33,CC,patient,No.
33,CC,doctor,I see. Okay. Let me take a look and then I'll have you walk down the hall to get an Xray so we can see what's going on.
34,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, so you are here for follow up today."
34,GENHX,patient,"Yes, very much."
34,GENHX,doctor,"I will ask you some regular questions, okay?"
34,GENHX,patient,Sure.
34,GENHX,doctor,Any pain in urination?
34,GENHX,patient,Nope.
34,GENHX,doctor,Any fever or chills?
34,GENHX,patient,Neither of them.
34,GENHX,doctor,Have you noticed any blood while urinating? Any blood in your urine?
34,GENHX,patient,"Nope. I do leak, especially when I'm changing my positions like from sitting to standing so I do feel there is some involuntary urination. It's more like a urge. I'm loading data in like every one hour in the morning, especially when I take that Lasix."
34,GENHX,doctor,Does it taper off in the afternoon or night?
34,GENHX,patient,It tapers off in the afternoon. And by the night I don't do not feel anything.
34,GENHX,doctor,Any leakage in the night?
34,GENHX,patient,Nope.
34,GENHX,doctor,Do you apply a lot of force to urinate?
34,GENHX,patient,Nope.
34,GENHX,doctor,How about this stream? Is it good or less? Are you emptying well? And what about the bowel movement?
34,GENHX,patient,The stream is good. It does feel like all is out in one go. I do not have any kind of bowel issues. I'm using my vaginal cream. Sometimes I feel difficulty in doing so because I feel that there is still something coming out from the vagina and I'm afraid that there might be a prolapse.
34,GENHX,doctor,"Don't worry, I will look into it."
35,ROS,doctor,Have you lost weight?
35,ROS,patient,"No, I haven't, you can ask my daughter."
35,ROS,doctor,"How about anything like fever, nausea, vomiting, pain?"
35,ROS,patient,No.
35,ROS,doctor,And as we discussed you have problem talking and comprehending.
35,ROS,patient,Yes.
35,ROS,doctor,And you get urine infections too?
35,ROS,patient,Yes.
35,ROS,doctor,"And as discussed, your drainage is similar to past episodes when you had such infection?"
35,ROS,patient,Yes.
36,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you use tobacco products? Cigarettes, chewing tobacco or vaping?"
36,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I used to smoke a pack a day.  I quit that awful habit in nineteen eighty five.
36,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you work?
36,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am retired.
36,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wonderful. Is your husband retired with you?
36,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. We both are. I cannot imagine working a full time job at seventy six years old.
37,GENHX,doctor,"Hi there, how are you?"
37,GENHX,patient,I am okay.
37,GENHX,doctor,"So, I see you turned eighty-eight yesterday, happy birthday!"
37,GENHX,patient,Thank you!
37,GENHX,doctor,"And you are referred by Doctor X, he is your primary physician, right?"
37,GENHX,patient,Correct! I am also seeing Doctor Y for my leukemia.
37,GENHX,doctor,Hm he mentioned that it's chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
37,GENHX,patient,Yes.
37,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
37,GENHX,doctor,And you are also seeing Doctor Z for your heart related problems.
37,GENHX,patient,That is correct.
37,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what is happening with you?"
37,GENHX,patient,For the past one week I am having this increased shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing from past few nights while sleeping.
37,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
37,GENHX,patient,And this morning I was having difficulty catching my breath. I am also having wheezing since morning.
37,GENHX,doctor,"Let me examine you, can you come forward and sit-up here? Any chest discomfort or acute chest pain or anything of that sort? Any pain of the left arm?"
37,GENHX,patient,No.
37,GENHX,doctor,"Any dizziness, feeling like fainting or light headedness or losing control?"
37,GENHX,patient,No.
37,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I don't think there is any sign of cardiovascular accident or heart attack, so that's that. You do have mild peripheral edema. We need to treat that."
37,GENHX,patient,Okay.
38,DISPOSITION,doctor,Ready to go home?
38,DISPOSITION,patient,I just can't wait.
38,DISPOSITION,doctor,Sure. I can understand.
38,DISPOSITION,patient,Bye Doctor.
38,DISPOSITION,doctor,Yes. See you soon.
39,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. How are you today? Can you confirm your age?"
39,GENHX,patient,"Fifty eight. I feel like my balance is off, and I've been feeling tired and weak."
39,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been experiencing this?
39,GENHX,patient,It's been going on for six to eight weeks.
39,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you feel any other symptoms?
39,GENHX,patient,"I haven't, but this might not be related. I had pneumonia ten days before this all started."
39,GENHX,doctor,Interesting. Did you take any medication for that?
39,GENHX,patient,"I did, but I don't know how to pronounce it. I wrote it down for you to read. Here it is."
39,GENHX,doctor,"Let me take a look. I see you took a full course of amoxicillin, right?"
39,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's right."
39,GENHX,doctor,How did you feel after you finished the antibiotics?
39,GENHX,patient,"Terrible. I felt like I couldn't control my body. My balance got even worse, and I felt even more tired and weak."
39,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. Do you know why your balance and coordination worsened?"
39,GENHX,patient,"I did fall recently, but I know for a fact my balance was off before my fall."
39,GENHX,doctor,How high were you when you fell?
39,GENHX,patient,I think I was three or five feet high when I fell.
39,GENHX,doctor,Did you fall on your back?
39,GENHX,patient,"No, I fell on my feet. Just kidding, I fell on my back."
39,GENHX,doctor,Funny. Did anything hurt after your fall?
39,GENHX,patient,"Not really, but I've been having some back pain in my lower and mid back."
39,GENHX,doctor,Did you always have that pain?
39,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't. It comes and goes."
39,GENHX,doctor,Have you done anything to treat it?
39,GENHX,patient,I started to see a chiropractor like five days ago. He adjusts my neck and lower back.
39,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you start having problems with your balance after this?
39,GENHX,patient,No. I was still having problems with that before I saw the chiropractor.
39,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. So, it wasn't the result of the adjustments. Is there anything else that may have caused it?"
39,GENHX,patient,"I was taking this other medicine for ten days, but I don't remember what it was for. Here is the name of the medication. I wrote it on another paper."
39,GENHX,doctor,It looks like you took Cipro. This is usually used to treat a U T I. Were you aware you had a U T I?
39,GENHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. I thought I had one, so I went to another doctor to get some medication."
39,GENHX,doctor,I see. I have one more question. Do you have any trouble controlling your bowel movements or attempting to go to the bathroom?
39,GENHX,patient,Nope. I feel like I'm able to go to the bathroom whenever I want.
40,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you had any illnesses in the past?
40,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
40,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Anything that is worth mentioning?
40,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
40,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Sure?
40,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
41,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir. My nurse tells me you're twenty eight years old, is that correct?"
41,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
41,GENHX,doctor,"So, what happened?"
41,GENHX,patient,"Well, I punched a wall about three days ago."
41,GENHX,doctor,Which hand is it?
41,GENHX,patient,It's my right hand.
41,GENHX,doctor,Is this your dominant hand?
41,GENHX,patient,"Unfortunately, yes, it is."
41,GENHX,doctor,Where does it hurt?
41,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's right here on the outside of my hand."
41,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments have you had?
41,GENHX,patient,"I went to the E D, and they pushed some of the joints in my hand back, and they put me in a splint, so I've been wearing that ever since."
41,GENHX,doctor,How is your pain today?
41,GENHX,patient,"Compared to when it started, it's much better today."
41,GENHX,doctor,How would you describe your pain today?
41,GENHX,patient,"Today, I'd say it's minimal pain."
41,GENHX,doctor,"Good, do you have any numbness or tingling today?"
41,GENHX,patient,"No, thankfully not."
42,EXAM,doctor,"Hello there, how are you?"
42,EXAM,patient,"I am good, thank you."
42,EXAM,doctor,"He is my colleague Doctor Mason, and he will be assisting me today and taking down notes."
42,EXAM,patient,Hello.
42,EXAM,doctor,Is it okay with you if he can join us?
42,EXAM,patient,"Sure, no problem."
42,EXAM,doctor,"Great, thank you"
42,EXAM,doctor,Doctor Mason can you take down the notes.
42,EXAM,doctor,Patient looks well developed and well nourished. He is alert with not acute distress.
42,EXAM,doctor,"Patient had a head injury, but he is fully conscious. G C S is fifty and nontoxic."
43,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anyone sick in your family?
43,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
43,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about anyone with the same disorders?
43,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't know."
43,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay don't you worry.
44,PLAN,doctor,How did the patient do on the activity test?
45,GENHX,doctor,How old was he when he were first evaluated in the other hospital?
45,GENHX,doctor,Which hospital was that again?
45,GENHX,doctor,So what exactly happened?
45,GENHX,doctor,Did the intensity change?
45,GENHX,doctor,How long were they in the duration?
45,GENHX,doctor,Was there any other associated disorder or anything?
46,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have major illnesses in the family like diabetes or high B P?
46,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No nothing. No major illnesses.
46,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
46,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
47,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Good morning, sir."
47,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Good morning, doctor."
47,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I just need some background information before we begin today.
47,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Sure.
47,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Good, have you ever had surgery, sir?"
47,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, actually I've had it on my knee, a nose job, and, um, carotid sinus surgery."
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you still working?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I am retired now. I used to work for the U S postal service as an electronic technician but took retirement one year earlier due to my disability."
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Ah okay. And who is in your family?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I stay with my wife and daughter in our apartment."
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. Do you smoke?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about alcohol?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I use to drink occasionally, that too very rare, but after my symptoms stated I stopped completely."
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any use of recreational or illegal drugs?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
48,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you travel anywhere recently?
48,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, it's been really long since I traveled anywhere."
49,EXAM,doctor,"Good afternoon, how are you today?"
49,EXAM,patient,"I am good Doctor, thanks for asking."
49,EXAM,doctor,"This is my colleague Doctor White, and she will be taking the notes. Is it okay if she joins us?"
49,EXAM,patient,"Oh sure, no problem."
49,EXAM,doctor,Thank you.
49,EXAM,patient,Nice to meet you too.
49,EXAM,doctor,"Okay, can you breathe in and out for me? Deep breaths please."
49,EXAM,patient,Okay.
49,EXAM,doctor,"Okay breath sounds are clear. Lung function looks good. Symmetrical rise and fall in chest as patient breathes. I am going to palpate your chest, it's just a routine exam."
49,EXAM,patient,Sure.
49,EXAM,doctor,"Doctor White can you make a note, no egophony or tactile fremitus."
50,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Where do you live?
50,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I live in a board and care. It is a nice small care home with some very nice and supportive people. It is just next to the Safeway on Village Drive.
50,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Nice. It looks like you love living there.
50,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Oh yes. I feel very relaxed there.
50,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you consume alcohol in any way?
50,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No Sir.
50,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any tobacco consumption?
50,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Never in my life.
50,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you ever try any kind of illicit drugs? Any I V drugs?
50,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. I have always kept myself away from all those things.
51,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
51,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Actually, yes, I had my gallbladder removed in nineteen ninety two."

51,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh yeah, I had my appendix out in nineteen eighty eight."
52,DISPOSITION,doctor,How are feeling now after the treatment?
52,DISPOSITION,patient,"I am feeling pretty fair, improving slowly."
52,DISPOSITION,doctor,Okay?
52,DISPOSITION,patient,Okay.
53,GENHX,doctor,Sir? Can you hear me? Are you Mister Smith's wife?
53,GENHX,doctor,How old is he? Can you tell me a little bit of how your husband's condition has come to this point? His level of consciousness is concerning.
53,GENHX,doctor,It looks like your husband was admitted to the emergency room the night before.  How did these injuries to his face happen?
53,GENHX,doctor,The Adult Protective Services said they found your husband in the home barley conscious. How long had he been that way?
53,GENHX,doctor,Do you know what other medications your husband has taken other than the Xanax?
54,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How have you been feeling? Is the Wellbutrin keeping your mood stabilized?
54,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have been feeling good. The Wellbutrin is working well for me.
54,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,It is important to not consume any alcohol or recreational drugs while taking Wellbutrin.
54,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't drink or do drugs.
55,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me a little bit about your family history.
55,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My dad and grandpa both had type two diabetes. My son is struggling with type one diabetes at the moment.
55,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. Does anyone in your family have heart problems?
55,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
55,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about cancer?
55,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Two of my cousins had breast cancer.
56,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Where do you work, miss?"
56,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, you see, I am a civil engineer. Right now, due to pandemic like everyone else I am working from home."
56,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you working full time or is your disability affecting that?
56,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I can only work on half time. This disability does not let me work full time. I need to go to physical therapy quite frequently on and off and I also have a baby who consumes a lot of my time."
56,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
56,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I've never done any of them."
57,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know any familiar diseases in your family?

59,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you have a history of mental illness or psychological disease?
59,PASTSURGICAL,patient,No.
60,GENHX,doctor,Hello sir. How are you doing today? You still look a little uncomfortable. Is there still pain?
60,GENHX,patient,Yeah. Still a good amount of pain. I did not take my pain medication this morning though. Not sure if that will make a huge difference.
60,GENHX,doctor,That is possibly why you are still in pain. How is movement? Can you get out of the house and get around?
60,GENHX,patient,Yes. I am quite happy that I can do my daily activities. I can get up with minimal assistance and do many activities out of the house. I think I am gaining muscle from moving around more too.
60,GENHX,doctor,How is the home exercise program going?
60,GENHX,patient,I am loving pool therapy. I really feel like that is helping. I do the home exercises sometimes twice a day. I really want to get back to normal.
61,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
61,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I had knee surgery."
61,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Which knee?

62,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
62,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What gender is you partner?
62,FAM/SOCHX,patient,He is a male. We have been together for three years. He is H I V positive.
63,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I remember you mentioned that you had one operation done in the past.
63,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a lymph node biopsy back in September of O three.
63,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Did it come back negative?
63,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Fortunately, yes."
64,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,It looks like you have an extensive medical history.
64,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I blame my heart. It's caused me the most trouble. I had coronary artery bypass surgery in twenty ten along with an angioplasty.
64,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I'm sorry that your heart has been giving you so much trouble. I'm happy that you're here with us today and taking the right measures to keep yourself healthy.
64,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh, and I forgot to mention that I've had prostate biopsies in the past."
64,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,When did you have the biopsies done?
64,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Last year.
64,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Did they come back negative?
64,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, fortunately. I guess my prostate isn't as troublesome as my heart."
64,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I understand.
65,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you have any medical problems?
65,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Let's see. I have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis."
65,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,And any surgeries?
65,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Several.
65,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Which ones?
65,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. I also had my uterus removed along with my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The list goes on. I had my appendix removed and two or three of my parathyroids taken out. Despite getting some of my parathyroids removed, I still have borderline high calcium levels according to my endocrinologist."
65,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Did you experience any complications during or after surgery?
65,PASTSURGICAL,patient,No. I forgot to mention that I had two carpel tunnel releases as well.
66,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
66,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mother passed away from complications with Huntington Disease. She was diagnosed and had been having treatments at U I H C. My grandmother and two of my aunts also passed away from Huntington as well.
66,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry. Do you have siblings?
66,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes! I have one sister. She is thirty eight. She has a lot of metal issues. She has attempted suicide two times.
66,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you close with her?
66,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. Not really.
66,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?

66,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have children?
66,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. We have two adopted kids.
67,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any medical problems on your mom or dad's side?
67,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My dad has lupus and his brother has Addison's disease. High blood pressure also runs in the family.
67,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is your dad being treated for lupus?
67,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, he follows up with his rheumatologist pretty regularly."
68,EXAM,doctor,I will do a quick exam on you.
68,EXAM,patient,What kind of exam?
68,EXAM,doctor,I'm just checking for lymph nodes. Whenever there is an infection those guys are the first ones to be noticed with swelling.
68,EXAM,doctor,"Okay, so let's first check your neck area. It looks good. I don't feel any inflamed lymph node. Your armpits look good too and the last place to check is your groin area. It is all good. No sign of infection."
69,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What are some medications you are on?
69,MEDICATIONS,patient,I am on pain pills.
69,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Do you know their names?
69,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes. Oxycontin and Vicodin.
69,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay that helps.
70,MEDICATIONS,doctor,I am looking at the list of your medication.
70,MEDICATIONS,patient,Okay.
70,MEDICATIONS,doctor,All I can see is Risperdal and Invega.
70,MEDICATIONS,patient,I think that is correct.
70,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you not taking anything else?
70,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I take some multivitamins, but do I need to mention it?"
70,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Yes, you should. We need to know everything."
70,MEDICATIONS,patient,Okay.
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am."
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, good morning, doctor."
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Please, tell me about your living situation."
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, right now, I live at home with my kids and my dad."
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I see here that you're not able to go up the stairs well, can you tell me more about that?"
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I can't use the stairs without holding the rail the entire time."
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Holding the rail makes navigating the stairs easier?
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, but I still move very slow."
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. Do you smoke?
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I smoke about a pack to a pack and a half a day."
71,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about exercise? Do you workout?
71,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't regularly workout, I've never been good at it."
72,CC,patient,My physician did a blood test. My potassium is high. He recommended me to meet you.
72,CC,doctor,Okay. I did not get the blood report yet. I am waiting for your doctor's office to send it to me. Is it only your potassium that is elevated?
72,CC,patient,"Yes, that's what they told me."
73,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"I am sorry! He does have multiple trauma due to the accident, and he will require aftercare."
74,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, what is your family's living situation at home?"
74,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,May I assume that you are his biological parents?
74,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Great, does he have any siblings?"
74,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What grade is he in?
74,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Great, and is he doing well in school?"
75,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, what gender do you identify with?"
75,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Thank you for asking, I identify as a female."
75,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Thank you. Do you know of any chronic illnesses?
75,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, but can you give me some examples of what you mean?"
75,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Well, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, diabetes, depression, anything like that ring any bells?"
75,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, no, I don't have anything like that."
76,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
76,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"What, like cancer?"
76,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"It doesn't have to be that serious, but is there anything you take medicine for?"
76,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, I have allergies and asthma."
77,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Can you tell me something about your mom and dad?  Like any diseases they have had?
77,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sure, my dad died of heart attack when he was sixty five and my mom died of stroke when she was seventy."
77,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How's about siblings, miss? Any health issues?"
77,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, my brother is healthy."
78,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does anyone in your family suffer from any health problems?
78,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No one comes to mind.
78,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great.
79,CC,doctor,"Tell me, what's going on?"
79,CC,patient,And I feel the right side is drooping.
79,CC,doctor,"Okay, let me look at it."
80,GENHX,doctor,"My chart here says that you're eighty three years old, is that correct, ma'am?"
80,GENHX,patient,"Yes doctor, that's correct, I just had my birthday."
80,GENHX,doctor,Happy belated birthday! How have you been doing since your last visit?
80,GENHX,patient,"Well, my cancer hasn't needed phlebotomies for several months now, which is good."
80,GENHX,doctor,"That's great, you have been treated for polycythemia vera, correct?"
80,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's the one."
80,GENHX,doctor,"I also see you're unassisted today, which is also great."
80,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, having some independence is nice."
81,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you have any family history of cancer?"
81,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, yes, but I can't remember who had what kind."
81,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Still, that's helpful, thank you. What about heart disease?"
81,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"That too, there's some history of heart disease, but I can't remember who."
82,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"As far as you know, are there any major health conditions that you know about?"
82,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,What do you mean by that?
82,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Anything like cancer, or arthritis, do those sound familiar?"
82,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, um, no nothing like that."
83,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any medical history that we should be aware of?
83,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I have type two diabetes. My numbers always come high.
83,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Okay, anything else?"
83,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I also have high cholesterol.
83,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay.
84,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hello. How are you feeling today?
84,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Great. I'm just here for my yearly physical.
84,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Oh, good. I see your past medical history is missing. Do you, by chance, know if you've had any health related problems before?"
84,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Uhm. Let me check my notes on my phone. I knew this question would pop up, but I always forget. Oh, perfect. You can take a look at them."
84,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Thank you. I just want to verify the information with you. You had asthma, nasal inflammation, and some abnormal growth on you neck, correct?"
84,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"If it's on there, then it's true. I usually don't remember these kinds of things. My wife is usually here with me. She knows all about my health."
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How's the little one doing?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How long was your pregnancy?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Was your delivery normal or C section?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How much did she weigh?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Tell me what's the issue?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What else did you notice?
85,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,It looks like she's having some food intolerance.
86,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What medications are you taking right now?
86,MEDICATIONS,patient,I am taking Advair and Allegra.
86,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay is it helping you?
86,MEDICATIONS,patient,"I don't know, I am not sure the Allegra is helping. But I do take them regularly."
86,MEDICATIONS,doctor,But is it like better than Claritin?
86,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I think so."

88,CC,doctor,"Have you experienced any increased thirst, mood changes or unusual fatigue?"
88,CC,patient,No.
89,EDCOURSE,doctor,"Well, I don't think you need any restraints as you are doing fine. I do want to make sure you have a chair and bed monitor since you have a history of multiple falls. They can help detect fall."

89,EDCOURSE,doctor,Are you sure?
89,EDCOURSE,patient,Yes!

103,GENHX,doctor,What is wrong with your back honey?
103,GENHX,patient,"Oh, it all started off with a little pimple on the buttock.  I was soaking it at home with hot water and stuff, but it did not improve. I hope this is not cancer. I am only twenty four."
103,GENHX,doctor,Okay what exactly are you experiencing?
103,GENHX,patient,I have pain.
103,GENHX,doctor,So you came to the hospital on the first and they did an I and D in E D?
103,GENHX,patient,Yes I was admitted to the hospitalist service with high blood sugars. My African American father was so scared.
103,GENHX,doctor,Okay sugars high. Do you know the number? How high?
103,GENHX,patient,"No, I do not know that but they found positive bacteria or some sort of thing in my blood culture."
103,GENHX,doctor,So today we are evaluating you for surgery?
103,GENHX,patient,Yes.
104,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Hi there! I have the results from your ultrasound. You have kidney stones in the ureter close to the bladder.
104,ASSESSMENT,patient,Oh no.
104,ASSESSMENT,doctor,This explains the pain you have been having on your left side. Are you still experiencing nausea and vomiting?
104,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes, I have been."
104,ASSESSMENT,doctor,I would like to set you up with a consult with a consult with a surgeon.
104,ASSESSMENT,patient,Okay.
105,ALLERGY,doctor,Any known drug allergies?
105,ALLERGY,patient,No.
106,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Your daughter had an exposure to the ant bait but we are not sure if she actually ingested any of it. Poison Control confirmed that even if she did ingest the small amount that she was found with, it is likely nontoxic. Do you have any questions?"
107,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. How are you today?"
107,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am alright. I am here for a check up since I am feeling kind of dizzy lately.
107,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is not good. How long has this been happening?
107,FAM/SOCHX,patient,A few months. This happened to my sister too. I think she is still dealing with it.
107,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is there any other family medical history I should know about? Migraines or cancer?
107,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. Not that I know of. The rest of my family seems pretty healthy.
108,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know anyone in your family whose had cancer?
108,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No one that I know.
109,LABS,doctor,Okay so your blood report is back and the cardiac enzyme we were looking for are negative.
109,LABS,patient,Okay.
109,LABS,doctor,"Your blood urea nitrogen, also known as B U N, is within normal limits and hydrogen is stable. Creatinine is also within the normal range."
109,LABS,patient,Great!
110,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you on any medications?
110,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, not taking any medications."
111,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, how are you doing today?"
111,GENHX,patient,I've been better. Thank you.
111,GENHX,doctor,"So, you are here for your follow up right? Remind me how often are you coming here?"
111,GENHX,patient,That's right. I'm coming around between a month or two.
111,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks."
111,GENHX,patient,I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know.
111,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant?"
111,GENHX,patient,"I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot."
111,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right?"
111,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I agree. That was a relief."
111,GENHX,doctor,"They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there."
111,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name."
111,GENHX,doctor,Is there any other issue that I can help you with?
111,GENHX,patient,"I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about?"
111,GENHX,doctor,"It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry."
112,EDCOURSE,doctor,Are you feeling any pain?
112,EDCOURSE,patient,"No, I feel great."
112,EDCOURSE,doctor,Is there any other medical issue that we should be worried about?
112,EDCOURSE,patient,"No, it feels like I'm young again. I'm able to do all my activities."
113,GENHX,doctor,Thank you for coming in to see us at A B C D General Hospital today.
113,GENHX,patient,I wish I wasn't here right now.
113,GENHX,doctor,"I understand, before we begin, how old are you?"
113,GENHX,patient,I'm seventy seven years young.
113,GENHX,doctor,"Which race, and gender do you identify with?"
113,GENHX,patient,I'm an African American woman.
113,GENHX,doctor,What's seems to be causing you pain today?
113,GENHX,patient,I've had this bunion on my foot for as long as I can remember.
113,GENHX,doctor,Is the pain worsening?
113,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it is so painful, I've tried to avoid surgery for so long, but I want this bunion gone."
113,GENHX,doctor,How have you managed this bunion in the past?
113,GENHX,patient,"I've used antiinflammatories, rested, changed my activities, I've done everything, but this pain is getting worse and worse.  I need it gone."
114,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have diabetes or blood pressure problems?
114,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I have hypertension but no diabetes."
114,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Alright.
115,GENHX,doctor,How are you dealing with your pain now?
115,GENHX,patient,"Oh no, I have no issues with my pain. Today I'm here for a different cause. I'm having this weakness all around on my left side, especially in my arm. I feel like I cannot lift anything like even a glass of water. It's hard for me to lift it up. I'm not able to walk properly, let alone the balancing and everything else. It's just that my whole left side seems to be weak."
116,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Did you have any medical disorders previously, sir?"
116,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I have diabetes. Also, I was quite overweight."
116,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you taking any medications for that?
116,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I was still taking something called Zyprexa, but I stopped it after my last regular weight check. Also, I never took anything for diabetes. I also have chronic bronchitis for… I don't know… many years."
116,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
116,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh yes, I am a smoker."
116,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How many cigarettes do you take in a day?
116,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Maybe up to sixty a day.
117,ROS,doctor,Lets talk about your ears. Any continuous ringing or thumping noises you may hear?
117,ROS,patient,"No, nothing like that."
117,ROS,doctor,Any hearing problems?
117,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
117,ROS,doctor,Any dizziness or spinning sensation?
117,ROS,patient,Nope.
118,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. You're eighty two years old, is that correct?"
118,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
118,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and just one more piece of background information, which hand do you write with?"
118,GENHX,patient,I use my right hand for everything.
118,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so what seems to be the problem today?"
118,GENHX,patient,"Doctor, I've had years of pain in this shoulder."
118,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments have you had?
118,GENHX,patient,"Well, um, I've had antiinflammatories, and rested, and none of it has helped so far."
118,GENHX,doctor,Can I assume the pain is impacting your daily life?
118,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it certainly is. The pain is unbearable now."
119,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you ever had surgery?
119,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"What, like a joint replacement?"
119,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Well, anything from joint replacements, to appendix removal, or C sections?"
119,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, I've had an appendectomy and hysterectomy, actually."
120,GENHX,doctor,"Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am?"
120,GENHX,patient,"Absolutely, I'm sixty six now."
120,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so it's been about five months since you last evaluation for type two diabetes and high blood pressure."
120,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and I have a few other problems today, too."
120,GENHX,doctor,"Sure, we can treat all of them. What seems to be the problem today?"
120,GENHX,patient,I'm having some right shoulder pain.
120,GENHX,doctor,Can you remember an injury to this shoulder?
120,GENHX,patient,"No, not that I can remember."
120,GENHX,doctor,What aggravates your symptoms?
120,GENHX,patient,It hurts when I move the shoulder.
120,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have any weakness, numbness, or tingling?"
120,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't have any of that."
120,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, back to diabetes, how has that been progressing?"
120,GENHX,patient,"Well, I can only check it in the morning, and it's usually less than one hundred."
120,GENHX,doctor,Have you been checking your blood sugar two hours after meals?
120,GENHX,patient,"No, doctor, I haven't been. When I check them, it's normal though."
120,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any records to prove that?
120,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't have that with me today."
120,GENHX,doctor,"That's important, do you have any other issues or concerns today?"
120,GENHX,patient,"No, I can't think of anything."
120,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. I'm looking at your charts, and I see you had a benign breast biopsy done on June eleventh two thousand four. Did you have a repeat done after six months like they asked?"
120,GENHX,patient,"No, I never had that done, I need to."
121,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
121,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"None, that I know of."
122,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you mind giving me a run down of his past medical history? I want to make sure it's all in his chart.
122,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see. When did he have these done?
122,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"If it's his prostate, then B P H is correct."
122,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Is he currently experiencing any symptoms?
123,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"How long have you been living with diabetes, sir?"
123,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, it's been about thirty five years now."
123,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How long have you been taking insulin for this?
123,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, um, I've been taking insulin for about twenty years now."
123,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about?
123,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, um, prostate cancer."
123,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How were you treated for this?
123,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I've had radiation. Oh, my P S A is zero point zero one, by the way."
124,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, what stomach symptoms are you experiencing?"
124,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I feel an intense burning in my throat.
124,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,When do you feel this?
124,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"It really hurts after eating food, especially junk food."
124,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,That's pretty consistent with reflux disease.
124,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Ah, yes."
124,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"I got your survey results back as well, let's discuss them."
124,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Absolutely, please, what does it show."
124,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"According to your answers, it looks like you have depression as well."
125,ROS,doctor,Any difficulty in swallowing?
125,ROS,patient,No.
125,ROS,doctor,"Any nausea, vomiting or blood in your vomit?"
125,ROS,patient,"No, no vomit at all. No problem there."
125,ROS,doctor,"Okay, any stomach pain?"
125,ROS,patient,No.
125,ROS,doctor,Okay.
126,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. How are you feeling today?"
126,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I'm sad and depressed.
126,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you feel that way?
126,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,My cancer came back.
127,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,What's going on with you? What brings you here today?
127,DIAGNOSIS,patient,I am having loose watery stools for more than two weeks now. I feel very lethargic. I also have pain in my tummy.
128,ALLERGY,doctor,Are you allergic to anything?
128,ALLERGY,patient,No.
129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you a smoker?
129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I used to smoke. I quit in nineteen sixty eight.
129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Excellent! Have you weighed your self recently?
129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I weighed myself this morning. I am at one hundred and eighty three pounds.
129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And how tall are you?
129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I used to be five foot ten but I think I have been shrinking.
129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is definitely a possibility. We do shrink as we go through life. I can have the nurse get your height after we do your exam.
129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay.
130,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
130,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I have never smoked in my entire life."
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Welcome to the clinic, sir."
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Thank you.
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Let us start with your medical history.
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I used to have seizures, but they have stopped now."
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Was there a cause of the seizures?
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,About seven years ago I had a traumatic stroke. They told me I had bleeding in the brain. After the stroke I was left with this weakness on my right side.
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What part of your body is affected by the weakness?
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"My arm, hand, and my face."
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any other health problems?
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,My liver is falling. It is because of all the alcohol that I have consumed over the years. I am not drinking anymore.
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you being treated for your liver disfunctions?
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No. I just stopped drinking. I think I have diabetes.
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What makes you feel like you have diabetes?
131,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I have been really thirsty, and I have been having numbness and tingling in my feet."
131,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Oh okay. We can definitely do some test today to find out if you are diabetic or not.
132,GENHX,doctor,Hi miss. How old are you?
132,GENHX,patient,I am sixteen.
132,GENHX,doctor,What race do you identify as?
132,GENHX,patient,White.
132,GENHX,doctor,Are you okay? You have a headache?
132,GENHX,patient,No I have a really bad migraine.
132,GENHX,doctor,Okay can you point to where you are feeling it the most?
132,GENHX,patient,"Here, since Monday."
132,GENHX,doctor,Okay so mostly on the right frontal side and it's been forty eight hours now?
132,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I am feeling a lot of pressure."
132,GENHX,doctor,I can understand the discomfort. Is it continuous or throbbing?
132,GENHX,patient,It is throbbing.
132,GENHX,doctor,"On the scale of one to ten, ten being the worst, how would you rate it?"
132,GENHX,patient,Nine or more.
132,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever experienced similar symptoms in the past?
132,GENHX,patient,No I haven't.
132,GENHX,doctor,Did you hit your head buy any chance?
132,GENHX,patient,No no.
132,GENHX,doctor,"Okay can you tell me if you have any fever or chills, congestion, cough cold like symptoms?"
132,GENHX,patient,No.
132,GENHX,doctor,"Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or trauma anywhere?"
132,GENHX,patient,No nothing like that.
132,GENHX,doctor,Anything from head to toe?
132,GENHX,patient,No everything else is fine.
133,EXAM,doctor,Has the patient signed a do not resuscitate order?
133,EXAM,doctor,Does she have a healthcare proxy or durable power of attorney?
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,How are you doing today?
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,"I have a long history of lung disease. COPD to be exact. Recently, I was experiencing a lot of coughing and shortness of breath even on walking from one room to another. All the time I felt sleepy, tired, or confused."
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,How is it now?
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,It is getting better.
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,What else?
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,"I was also diagnosed with pneumonia; I was on trip and there they found it. It is also getting a lot better now, but doctor said to continue taking oxygen for some more time."
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Oh wow!
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,"With everything going on, I felt weak and tired and it looks like I have lost all my strength and muscle."
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,I also felt very instable and had a fall. I did not call for any assistance but now I think I should have called someone. Everyone including my family and nurses all tell me all the time to call for assistance. I was just being stubborn and hurt myself.
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Did you use a wheelchair?
134,ASSESSMENT,patient,No.
134,ASSESSMENT,doctor,You know I would agree with everyone else; you should call for assistance if you need help like getting out of bed or need to use the restroom.
135,ALLERGY,doctor,Were there any medical issues in the past?
135,ALLERGY,patient,"Oh, I have a list. I have asthma and sinus issues. I also had hives at some point and psoriasis."
135,ALLERGY,doctor,How about allergies?
135,ALLERGY,patient,I don't know of any.
136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you use tobacco products, alcohol, or recreational drugs, miss?"
136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have a drink every once and a while.
136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How many drinks do you consume in a week?
136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't even drink that often. I probably have one drink per month.
136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I was engaged but that is not happening anymore. It is a long story.
136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am sorry the hear that. What do you do for work?
136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am a metal grinder.
137,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Now that you're eighteen, I have a big question to ask you. Do you smoke?"
137,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Never have, never will."
137,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"That's what I like to hear. You have a good head on your shoulders, bud."
137,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thanks. I'd like to think so, too. I have some friends who smoke weed, but stay clear of tobacco."
138,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you ever been diagnosed with any illnesses?
138,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I do not have any diseases."

141,GENHX,doctor,"How would you define it mild, moderate, or severe?"
141,GENHX,patient,I would say mild.
141,GENHX,doctor,What about vomiting?
141,GENHX,patient,"No, only nausea is there. If I try to take deep breaths, then I still have pain."

142,GENHX,doctor,Any pain elsewhere?
142,GENHX,patient,Um I'm having some pain in my lower stomach area. I think it could be due to slamming into the airbag or steering wheel.
142,GENHX,doctor,"How would you rate this pain, ten being the worst pain ever?"
142,GENHX,patient,Um I'd give it a five out of ten right now.
142,GENHX,doctor,"Any knee, ankle, or foot pain?"
142,GENHX,patient,No.
142,GENHX,doctor,"How about pain in your shoulders, elbows, or wrists?"

146,GENHX,doctor,We did electromyography study. This was to assess the health of muscles and the nerves in your body. When did you first notice this discomfort?
146,GENHX,patient,About five years ago. After my stroke. I've been to a neurologist before.
146,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, I can see that you have taken different kinds of medications, but nothing seems to help you."
146,GENHX,patient,That sounds right. Nothing seems to help me to get rid of this discomfort.
146,GENHX,doctor,How often do you check your sugar levels?
146,GENHX,patient,I do it at home. Mainly two to three times a day. I increase or decrease the amount of insulin that I take based on my numbers.
146,GENHX,doctor,Don't you consult anyone before doing that?
146,GENHX,patient,It's been so many years now. I do it all by myself.
146,GENHX,doctor,We did reevaluations of your symptoms. It turned out to be all negative. Do you smoke?
146,GENHX,patient,I used to chew tobacco a lot and then there were drinks. I used to drink at least half a bottle of single malt in one night. I quit everything five years ago after my stroke.

147,ASSESSMENT,patient,About a week ago. I don't take it every day. I don't feel like I need it some days.
147,ASSESSMENT,doctor,I want you to take the full dosage every day. This might be why you have not had much relief with your symptoms yet.
147,ASSESSMENT,patient,Okay.
147,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Your hands are a little shaky. Is this a normal occurrence for you?
147,ASSESSMENT,patient,I didn't even notice.
147,ASSESSMENT,doctor,It is very subtle. We will keep an eye on it for now. Your blood pressure is a little better today. Have you experienced any worsening joint or bone pain?  I want to check on your osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.

162,GENHX,patient,"German shepherd. But he is up to date on his shots, and he is completely healthy."
162,GENHX,patient,"He bit me on my foot, and it looks like his teeth went into my skin. I went to my P C P."

176,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yes, it is."
177,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,You have an infection that has become septic. We are going to have to start you on intravenous antibiotics.

179,CC,patient,"Well, I think I am suffering from memory loss, like short term memory loss."
179,CC,doctor,"Okay, and why do you say so?"
179,CC,patient,I have been under tremendous stress for the last five to ten years. I am currently working for T mobile customer service and my work is really hectic. It requires a lot of technical knowledge with project deadlines which is adding to my stress.
179,CC,patient,Sometimes I have trouble absorbing all the technical knowledge and computer skills or customer issues.
179,CC,doctor,Hm.
179,CC,patient,"I did my M B A in business for a reason, I wanted to make a good career, but this job is very demanding and stressful. I previously worked at a bank in Conway Springs, Norwich. I have worked many jobs around accounting and management services, but my current job is a high stress one."
179,CC,doctor,"I see, are you married?"
179,CC,patient,"I have been widowed for past eleven years. My husband died in a car accident, he was hit by drunk driver. It was not the time for my husband to go! After he left, I had to take care of everything and that's another reason for my stress from the past several years."
179,CC,doctor,I am so sorry to hear that.
179,CC,patient,Yeah.
179,CC,doctor,"Okay, so tell me any weakness or dizziness or lethargy in the past or now?"
179,CC,patient,No.
179,CC,doctor,Any history of stroke?
179,CC,patient,No.
180,CC,doctor,Hi there! Welcome to the clinic.
180,CC,patient,Thank you.
180,CC,doctor,"Doctor Murphy sent your records over. I reviewed the ultrasound, and we did find a kidney stone that has become stuck in the ureter on the left side. The stone is large enough to block the flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder.  How much pain are you having and where is the pain located?"
180,CC,patient,I am in a great deal of pain. It is coming from my left side right here.
180,CC,doctor,Okay. Let use discuss your treatment options.
180,CC,patient,Okay.
181,ALLERGY,doctor,Any allergies?
181,ALLERGY,patient,What do you mean?
181,ALLERGY,doctor,Are you allergic to anything?
181,ALLERGY,patient,"No no, oh no."
182,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,You have type two Diabetes?
182,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
182,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,And High Cholesterol?
182,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
182,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Your diabetes is poorly controlled.
182,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I will keep an eye on it.
183,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me more about your daughter's injury?
183,GENHX,doctor,Did she have surgery on this?
183,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, how old are you, dear?"
183,GENHX,patient,I'm thirteen now.
183,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, thank you. So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint."
183,GENHX,doctor,We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.
183,GENHX,doctor,"Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent."
183,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing."
183,GENHX,doctor,"I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things."
183,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends."
184,CC,doctor,What brings you in today?
184,CC,patient,Um a number of different things. I don't even know where to start to be honest.
184,CC,doctor,I understand. What's bothering you the most?
184,CC,patient,Lemme think. I'm uh having really bad pain.
184,CC,doctor,Where's the pain located?
184,CC,patient,Hm. It's in a tricky spot.
184,CC,doctor,Any recent injuries or falls?
185,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, I want you to meet my assistant. She will be helping me out with your case today."
185,GENHX,doctor,Please represent the patient's case.
185,GENHX,doctor,"You said you are feeling dizziness, so what makes it worse?"
185,GENHX,patient,It's bad whenever I try to stand straight. I also have these intermittent headaches where it feels like somebody is hammering inside.
185,GENHX,doctor,Do these headaches change with changing the positions or standing straight?
185,GENHX,patient,No.
185,GENHX,doctor,Does the patient have any known medical history?
185,GENHX,doctor,"So, your headaches-- how long has this been going on?"
185,GENHX,patient,Many weeks now.
185,GENHX,doctor,Do you smoke?

187,GENHX,patient,"Um, yeah, I've had tingling in both my legs, like in the front, and then it goes into my toes too."
187,GENHX,doctor,Did this tingling sensation go away?
187,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it went away the next day without me doing anything."
187,GENHX,doctor,Have these symptoms returned at any point?
187,GENHX,patient,"Well, two days later, so that'd be the twenty fifth, I noticed that my legs felt like they were asleep. I really couldn't feel anything."
187,GENHX,doctor,Have these symptoms spread to any other part of the body?

188,GENHX,patient,"Good, can't complain."
188,GENHX,doctor,"Glad to hear. So today we're going to do a comprehensive eval. It'll be a bit different than our usual visits together. Would you like your mom to step in the room, too?"
188,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's not a problem."
188,GENHX,doctor,Alright. I'll grab her from the waiting room. I'll be right back.
189,ROS,doctor,Okay.
189,ROS,doctor,"Oh yeah, she has chronic AFib and she is on Coumadin. Not sure if she has stopped the medicine due to upcoming surgery."
189,ROS,doctor,Alright.

190,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Were you exposed to anything recently?
190,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Here's a note from a contractor that worked on my house recently. I wasn't sure what it meant.
190,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. It looks like you may have been exposed to asbestos.
190,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, no! Am I going to be fine?"
190,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'll take a look, but I want to ask you a quick question. Did you have any family living with you at the time?"
190,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope. I live alone, so my family wasn't there to be exposed."
191,GENHX,doctor,"How are you feeling today, ma'am?"
191,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, overall, I'm feeling a lot better."
191,GENHX,doctor,Are you still having the diarrhea and decreased appetite?
191,GENHX,patient,"Yes, but I'm still feeling better though."
191,GENHX,doctor,Have you been peeing a normal amount?

192,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. I was a boxer before so that's why I was always stayed away from these things.
192,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How is your living condition? Are you living alone or with family?
192,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Mostly I'm by myself during the daytime. Family comes to help with me on and off. I just love it that way. I wasn't to be in an independent home setting soon.

194,GENHX,doctor,Thank you Doctor.  Tell me how are you doing young man? Are there any difficulties going back to school?
194,GENHX,patient,I am doing fine. I do get some headaches and it feels like somebody is ringing bells in my ears. My eyesight has improved a lot.
195,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, please, when was your surgery?"
195,GENHX,patient,"Well, it's been about two and a half months now."
195,GENHX,doctor,"Great, we repaired that slipped capital femoral epiphysis on both sides, we call it S C F E."
195,GENHX,patient,"Thank you for reminding me, I forgot the names of everything."
196,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Any medications I should know about?
196,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Nah, no daily meds."
197,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Is your husband still around, ma'am?"
197,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, he passed away a few years ago."
197,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear that.
197,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, it's quite all right."
197,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink or smoke?
197,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't do either of those."
197,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, so where are you living now?"
197,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm living at Kansas Christian Home.
197,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you live independently there?
197,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, thankfully. But, I can't do a lot of things. I have to be sure to take my medicines."

198,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome in, Miss A!"
198,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
198,GENHX,doctor,How have you been doing?
198,GENHX,patient,I am good today!
198,GENHX,doctor,Have you not been feeling good other days?
198,GENHX,patient,I have been feeling nervous and having some anxiety lately.
198,GENHX,doctor,Is your feelings of nervousness or anxiousness triggered by anything specific?
198,GENHX,patient,It varies. I feel anxious when I think about retuning to work or this upcoming trip that I have planned.
198,GENHX,doctor,How often do you feel this way?
198,GENHX,patient,It comes and goes.
198,GENHX,doctor,"Have you ever had any treatment or history of depression, anxiety, or mood disorders?"

199,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about drugs?
199,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sometimes, but I don't want to talk about it."
199,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. Anything else you want to talk about?
199,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Pardon?
200,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir."
200,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Refresh my memory, please, how old are you, sir?"
200,GENHX,patient,I'm forty nine.
200,GENHX,doctor,"Also, I need you to remind me, when was your lower back surgery?"
200,GENHX,patient,"It was in January of two thousand five. What was the name of the surgery, again?"
200,GENHX,doctor,"It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today?"
200,GENHX,patient,"Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?"
200,GENHX,patient,"I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too."
200,GENHX,doctor,Have you taken any medicines?
200,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro."
200,GENHX,doctor,Are you still taking any of these?
200,GENHX,patient,"No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything."
200,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any injections for this pain?
200,GENHX,patient,"I've had a few into the, um, piriformis."
200,GENHX,doctor,Did that do anything?
200,GENHX,patient,"Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six."
200,GENHX,doctor,How did this work?
200,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, it did nothing."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Where is your pain, exactly?"
200,GENHX,patient,"I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that?"
200,GENHX,patient,"I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back."
200,GENHX,doctor,"I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?"
200,GENHX,patient,I'd say it's a six out of ten today.
200,GENHX,doctor,What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?
200,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Specifically, what activities make the pain worse?"
200,GENHX,patient,"Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore."
200,GENHX,doctor,Does anything make the pain better?
200,GENHX,patient,"Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication."
200,GENHX,doctor,"Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?"
200,GENHX,patient,"It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes."
200,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to sleep at night?
200,GENHX,patient,"Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood."
200,GENHX,doctor,"So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?"
200,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
201,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have a family history of neurological conditions that I should know about?
201,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"What exactly do you mean by that, doctor?"
201,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Well, it could be anything from A D H D, to epilepsy, to Alzheimer's."
201,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, no."
202,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you on any medications?
202,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yeah. I take Abilify to help with my mood.
202,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Do you find that it's helping?
202,MEDICATIONS,patient,"A little, yeah."

209,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, young lady. Is this your mother?"
209,GENHX,patient,"Yes, this is my mommy."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, mom. Can you tell me more about your daughter, please?"
209,GENHX,doctor,What's been the problem with her feet?
209,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, how has she been since that procedure?"
209,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity."
209,GENHX,patient,"What does that mean, doctor?"
209,GENHX,doctor,"Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?"
209,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low."
209,GENHX,doctor,We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time.
209,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum."
209,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months."
209,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends."
209,GENHX,doctor,"The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision."
210,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, young man. Are these your parents?"
210,GENHX,patient,Yes.
210,GENHX,doctor,"Good, can you tell me more about your son, please?"
210,GENHX,doctor,"After he fell, how was he treated?"
210,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I see that here, he also has shortening bayonet apposition."
210,GENHX,doctor,"There's actually a few options here. First we can cast it and see how he heals, generally, children heal up very well from fractures."
210,GENHX,doctor,"However, surgery is also an option here as well."
210,GENHX,doctor,"The risk of infection is very low, generally less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection."
210,GENHX,doctor,"Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, and cast tightness. I would not worry about these risks. We have great results with these surgeries."
211,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hello. Are you a new patient?
211,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I am. I've been traveling a lot, so I don't have a local doctor I usually see."
211,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,That's fine. What is the reason for your visit?
211,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I've had this dark spot on my leg for a long time.
211,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see. Do you know if your family has any chronic medical problems?
211,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Not that I know of.
211,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"That's good. I think I'll be able to remove it surgically. Before I go over the procedures, have you had a surgery before?"
211,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, I have. I had surgery on my back and to remove my appendix."
211,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Sounds good. Other than that dark spot, you seem to be very healthy."
212,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,It's surgery day! How are you feeling?
212,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Not as excited as you.
212,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had a surgery before?

218,CC,doctor,Hello! What brings you back into the clinic today?
218,CC,patient,I came back because I increased my methothrexate as we discussed the last time I was here. A few days later I started getting multiple canker sores in my mouth. They hurt.
218,CC,doctor,"I am sorry. It is likely that the increased dosage of your methothrexate is the cause of the mouth sores. Have you experienced a decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort or diarrhea?"
218,CC,patient,"No. It is painful to eat with the sores, but I still have an appetite."
218,CC,doctor,"Have you had any new rashes, or hair loss?"

227,GENHX,doctor,Who has evaluated you to date?
227,GENHX,patient,"Um, I went to Gig Harbor Urgent Care, and then they sent me to Tacoma General Hospital. At Tacoma they said I have a whiplash and concussion."

236,GENHX,patient,"Oh yes, I got it with me. Here it is."

240,GENHX,patient,"I've taken antiinflammatories, had injections, and I've even used narcotics."
240,GENHX,doctor,"I see. If those haven't helped, I think you'd be a good candidate for knee replacements."
240,GENHX,patient,Can we do both at the same time?
240,GENHX,doctor,"No, let's do the left since that one hurts more. Do you have any other conditions I should know about?"

243,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Right now, I'm working with Chevron as a petroleum engineer."
243,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"That's fantastic. So, do you drink?"
243,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Um, I'd say I drink socially, like if I'm at a party or something."

245,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, nice to meet you."
245,GENHX,doctor,Tell me what happened.
245,GENHX,patient,They asked me to go to the physical therapy for all the problems I was having after my brain surgery. I went from November fifth to the fourteenth of last year. I did therapy for around two weeks starting on November fifth. My problems were not solved so I went to the hospital and then they did some tests and they found out something was wrong. They said there is swelling in my brain so they admitted me there and then I had my second surgery.
245,GENHX,doctor,When was the second surgery? When did you get admitted?
245,GENHX,patient,It was on December fifth. I was there in the rehab the whole time and then I was discharged for home one month after my second surgery.

This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?"
247,GENHX,patient,"Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often."
247,GENHX,doctor,"Oh boy, that's a lot going on!"
247,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
247,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?"
247,GENHX,patient,"No, it's fine."
247,GENHX,doctor,And are you taking anything for constipation?
247,GENHX,patient,"Well, just prune juice."
247,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help. How bout cough? Any pain in the ribs while coughing?"
247,GENHX,patient,"Nah, I am not bothered by it."
247,GENHX,doctor,Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?
247,GENHX,patient,"Um, no I am fine."
247,GENHX,doctor,Any fall or imbalance problem?
247,GENHX,patient,No.
247,GENHX,doctor,Any agitation or any other issues?
247,GENHX,patient,"Well, I am doing okay! Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me."
247,GENHX,doctor,That's good!
247,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
247,GENHX,doctor,"So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?"
247,GENHX,patient,Yes.
247,GENHX,doctor,"She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta."
247,GENHX,patient,Right.
247,GENHX,doctor,"And no side effects, right?"
247,GENHX,patient,No.
247,GENHX,doctor,And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year.
247,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
247,GENHX,doctor,"Lastly, any breathing issues?"
247,GENHX,patient,No.
248,GENHX,doctor,"The next patient we have is Miss Dey, we have been regularly following up with her for her hydrocephalus since two thousand and two."
248,GENHX,doctor,"She also had anterior cervical corpectomy, we removed her front part of the vertebra followed by fusion from C three to C five in March two thousand and seven."
248,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah. We last saw her in March two thousand and eight at that time she was experiencing some head fullness and ringing in the ears, however we decided to leave her shunt setting at one point zero."
248,GENHX,doctor,"Yes exactly! Let's go see her. Hello Miss Dey, how are you? This is my colleague doctor Jen, and she will be accompanying me today if that is okay with you?"
248,GENHX,patient,"Of course, Hello doctors."
248,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what is going on?"
248,GENHX,patient,"Well, last week I had some urine issue, like had to pee frequently. I had few episodes of urgency."
248,GENHX,doctor,Okay and how do you feel this week?
248,GENHX,patient,This week it's much better I am not feeling like how I was feeling last week.
248,GENHX,doctor,Okay good.
248,GENHX,patient,I feel no urgency or inconsistency and I am able to empty my bladder completely.
248,GENHX,doctor,That's good.
248,GENHX,patient,"However, I do leak some pee when I cough. I wear pads daily."
248,GENHX,doctor,"And did you notice any changes regarding your bladder, do you think it is better than before or worse since the last time I saw you?"
248,GENHX,patient,"I don't think it changed much, it feels almost the same."
248,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. Let's talk about your memory, any problem there, are you able to remember stuff and think about stuff?"
248,GENHX,patient,"Yes, all good there, no issues."
248,GENHX,doctor,Any headache?
248,GENHX,patient,Nope!
248,GENHX,doctor,Any changes in your walk or balance?
248,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I feel both have worsened. I am able to walk on uneven surface most of the time. But I feel I have become very slow."
248,GENHX,doctor,And are you able to climb up and down the stairs?
248,GENHX,patient,Yes.
248,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to climb in and out of the car normally without any fuss?
248,GENHX,patient,Yes.
248,GENHX,doctor,Are you using cane at this point of time?
248,GENHX,patient,"No, no cane."
248,GENHX,doctor,Okay good. Anything else you want to tell me?
248,GENHX,patient,"Ah yes, in the beginning of May, I got a spell of severe cough and because of continuous coughing I think I developed pain in my hip which travels down to my legs."
248,GENHX,doctor,"Oh okay, do you feel any tingling or numbness."
248,GENHX,patient,Yes! I feel constant tingling sensation and a feeling that something is pinching my never. Sometimes it's just so painful.
248,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
248,GENHX,patient,Often I feel like my legs have become like elastic. I feel this tingling sensation is the reason my walking has become slower.
248,GENHX,doctor,Doctor Jen did you take the notes of what she said?
248,GENHX,doctor,"Okay great, anything else Miss Dey?"
248,GENHX,patient,"No, I think I told you everything."
248,GENHX,doctor,Alright you take care. I will see you next time.
248,GENHX,patient,Bye!
248,GENHX,doctor,Bye.
249,PLAN,doctor,"So, you saw Doctor X?"

249,PLAN,doctor,"Yes, I will look at C B C diff and C M P profile."
249,PLAN,patient,"I will follow up with my oncologist, Doctor Z, for my swellings."

249,PLAN,patient,Okay I will do that.
249,PLAN,doctor,"Also, I would like to follow up with your endocrinologist that is Doctor A for adjustments that is needed in your insulin pump."
249,PLAN,patient,And you want me to see my gastro doc too?
249,PLAN,doctor,"Yes, please follow up with Doctor B for issues with your J tube."
249,PLAN,patient,Sure thing.
249,PLAN,doctor,"Lastly, I want you to see Doctor Y if your condition changes regarding colon cancer."
250,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see here that you were in for afib last month.
250,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yep.
250,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How're you doing?
250,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,It's all under control for now.

251,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you on insulin?
251,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yeah. I'm also trying to manage it with exercise.
252,EXAM,doctor,"Let me examine your leg. Well your x ray looks fine. No defect there, I don't see any mass or swelling. Are you able to walk or use that leg at all?"
252,EXAM,patient,"Oh yes, I am using it. I have also started going back on my regular walk."
252,EXAM,doctor,"Good, so your muscle strength is good, no loss of muscle tone there."
252,EXAM,patient,Yeah.
253,CC,doctor,"Hello, how are you?"
253,CC,patient,"Hi Doctor, I am good."
253,CC,doctor,"So, what is going on with you?"
253,CC,patient,"Well, I am having nausea and I just want to get it checked."
253,CC,doctor,Okay.
254,ROS,doctor,How long have you had this cough?
254,ROS,patient,"Past three weeks, doc."
254,ROS,doctor,Are you bringing anything up when you cough?
254,ROS,patient,Nah.
254,ROS,doctor,Any shortness of breath or chest pain?
254,ROS,patient,Nah.
254,ROS,doctor,How about fevers or chills?
254,ROS,patient,None of that.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Let's go over your history.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Okay.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see that you had an appendectomy.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Back in the nineteen forties. I also had an ankle resection in nineteen seventy five.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any complications with either surgery?
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Uh nope.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I also see that you have a recurring history of pneumonia.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yeah. Started around age twenty and stuck with me ever since.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How often have you had pneumonia?
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Once every five years or so.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you ever been hospitalized due to pneumonia?
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Uh I'm usually given antibiotics and then discharged.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Unfortunately, I've had more episodes in the past year than ever before."
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Any history of inherited lung disease, bronchiectasis, or other chronic pulmonary cause for repeated pneumonia?"
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Not to my knowledge.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"And you recently saw the urologist, correct?"
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes. I had a catheter placed for urinary retention. He told me he thinks it's due to an enlarged prostate.
255,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have a history of diabetes or other medical problems?
255,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Uh no. I've lost about eighteen pounds in the last month but other than that everything else seems to be fine.
256,ROS,doctor,Hi again! How are you feeling today?
256,ROS,patient,I am feeling okay.
256,ROS,doctor,Are you still experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
256,ROS,patient,No. I feel better now.
256,ROS,doctor,Have you had any shortness of breath or chest pain?
256,ROS,patient,No.
256,ROS,doctor,Any painful or burning urination?
256,ROS,patient,No.
256,ROS,doctor,Do you have a history of any seizure disorder?
256,ROS,patient,No.
257,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me about your family medical history.
257,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No one in my family has any health problems.
258,GENHX,doctor,"Your son had his circumcision performed here at Children's Hospital, correct?"
258,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember the date of that procedure?
258,GENHX,doctor,"Good, the procedure went well. He had some phimosis, but the operation was quite smooth otherwise."
258,GENHX,doctor,"That's tightness of the foreskin. It sometimes makes the procedure more difficult, but everything went smoothly."
258,GENHX,doctor,"He also had a little bit of bleeding when he woke up in the recovery room, so we had to put in some additional sutures."
258,GENHX,doctor,It's my pleasure. Has he been taking his pain medicine?
258,GENHX,doctor,"Great, does he have any difficulty urinating?"
258,GENHX,doctor,Bowel movements? How are they?
259,CC,doctor,Is this something new? Or have you had it before?
259,CC,patient,"No doctor, this is new."
259,CC,doctor,What exactly are you feeling?
259,CC,patient,I feel like my tongue is swollen.
259,CC,doctor,Okay. How old are you?
259,CC,patient,I am fifty four years old.
259,CC,doctor,Okay let me see how we can evaluate that.
260,CC,doctor,"So, I think we need to start you on antibiotics for that ulcer on your right foot and possible osteomyelitis. I will send a prescription to your pharmacy."
260,CC,patient,Sure.
261,DISPOSITION,doctor,"Your condition is improved, and you look pretty stable."
261,DISPOSITION,patient,"Yeah, I feel much better."
262,ALLERGY,doctor,Do you have any allergies to medications?
262,ALLERGY,patient,Yes. Penicillin.
263,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Looks like you have a U T I and I need to give you some antibiotics to treat it.
263,MEDICATIONS,patient,Okay.
263,MEDICATIONS,doctor,I will write you a prescription for Macrobid. Are you still using the Walgreens pharmacy at Thrashers Corner?
263,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes.
263,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you taking any other medications?
263,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I am taking quite a few. I always carry the list of my medications, let me tell you the names.  Yeah, so I take Dilantin for my seizures, Toprol for my high blood pressure and Pravachol for my cholesterol."
263,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Pravachol for my cholesterol. Wow, thank you for that, it helps a lot. Let me make a note of it."
263,MEDICATIONS,patient,Sure.
264,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you had any operations in the-
264,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope. No surgeries.
264,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How about any past injuries or illnesses?
264,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
265,CC,doctor,What is going on?
265,CC,patient,I have pain in my jaw since the morning.
265,CC,doctor,How bad is it?
265,CC,patient,Not that bad.
266,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Have you taken any medications in the past?
266,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Do you mean prescription, or over the counter?"
266,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Either of those.
266,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Oh, I haven't taken anything in the past."
267,PLAN,doctor,Any changes to your diet?
267,PLAN,patient,I've been following the A D A diet online and maxing out at around eighteen hundred calories per day.
267,PLAN,doctor,How're you feeling since starting this diet?
267,PLAN,patient,A lot better actually. My blood sugar isn't as high as it used to be.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hello! How are you doing?
268,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I am doing okay.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Tell me about your past medical history.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer two years ago. They found a tumor in my upper abdomen. I had surgery and they removed everything. Doctor King is my oncologist.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you still undergoing treatment?
268,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any other medical conditions?
268,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Have a heart murmur. It has not been an issue. I also have acid reflux.
268,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you take medication for the G E R D?
268,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes. I take omeprazole.
269,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. Before we begin your physical, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please?"
269,GENHX,patient,I'm forty two years old and identify as white.
269,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. I also see that you're here for a follow up for your asthma, correct? How is your asthma?"
269,GENHX,patient,"That's right. Oh, man. My asthma has been getting worse over the last three months. My allergies are also acting up again."
269,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, no. Has anything changed that may have made your allergies worse?"
269,GENHX,patient,"Well, my husband has been hauling more corn in since it's busy season. I think that might have made it worse."
269,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking any medications to alleviate your asthma and allergies?
269,GENHX,patient,"I'm using my inhaler every day for my asthma. Here are the other medications and treatments I've been using. I know I wouldn't have remembered, so I put them on a paper for you to see."
269,GENHX,doctor,Let me take a look. I see you have been taking Allegra for your allergies. Has that been helping?
269,GENHX,patient,Eh. It kind of helps when I do take it.
269,GENHX,doctor,You don't take it every day then?
269,GENHX,patient,Nope. Only when I feel like I need to.
269,GENHX,doctor,I see. What about the Flonase? Has that been helping?
269,GENHX,patient,"I'm not taking that right now, but it helped me in the past."
269,GENHX,doctor,"I also see you took Advair in the past, correct? Do you still take it?"
269,GENHX,patient,"I did, but I stopped taking it because it started to annoy my private area."
269,GENHX,doctor,I understand. Speaking more on this. Let's begin your physical. Do you have anything you'd like to add that you're starting to notice more?
269,GENHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm easily annoyed right before my period. It could also be my husband, but he likes to say it's because I'm about to start my period."
269,GENHX,doctor,I see. Do you see any other increased symptoms right before your menstrual cycle?
269,GENHX,patient,"Yeah. I feel like I've seen an increase in all the signs before my period. I'm also getting more impatient around that time, but when I'm not on my period, I feel like my mood is better."
269,GENHX,doctor,When do you see your mood change?
269,GENHX,patient,"My husband says it's bad the week before I start my period, but I think it gets better a day after I start."
269,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen any bleeding during your cycle?
269,GENHX,patient,Not as much anymore. Just some spots here and there.
269,GENHX,doctor,I see. What about hot flashes or night sweats?
269,GENHX,patient,Nope. I feel fine most of the time.
269,GENHX,doctor,"That's good. I'm looking at your chart right now and it says you showed a U T I present, correct? Your test showed blood in your urine."
269,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct."
269,GENHX,doctor,Has your urine been checked since then?
269,GENHX,patient,Nope.
269,GENHX,doctor,I see. I'll order another urine test along with additional lab tests so that we can complete your physical.
269,GENHX,patient,"I actually just had some lab work done because it was required for a life insurance application. Crazy, right? Here's the form with all the details for the lab work."
269,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, perfect. I see they looked at your cholesterol and other areas. Could you send that to me when you get the results?"
269,GENHX,patient,Of course. I'll get that sent to you A S A P.
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How are your parents doing, sir?"
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, doctor, I've lost both of them now."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. How about your brothers?"
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you, doctor. Both of my brothers are doing very well."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Remind me, please, how old are they?"
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"One of them is sixty eight, and the other is seventy seven. I'm in the middle."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's great. Do you have any medical conditions that run in your family?
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I'm not sure if it counts, but I had a brother and sister, they were twins, they died at birth."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh no, thank you for telling me."
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I thought it would be important."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have any children, sir?"
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have two sons, they're both doing very well."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How old are your sons?
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"One of them is fifty four, and the other is fifty seven."
270,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"In addition to the neonatal deaths, do you have any other conditions that I should know about?"
270,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, um, a lot of my family has diabetes, and a lot of them have had heart attacks as well."
271,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?"
271,GENHX,patient,I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you.
271,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct?"
271,GENHX,patient,Is that what they're calling my nasal problems?
271,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways."
271,GENHX,patient,I see. Thank you for describing it to me.
271,GENHX,doctor,No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago?
271,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat."
271,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever been prescribed any medication?
271,GENHX,patient,Here's the list of medicine I was taking.
271,GENHX,doctor,"I see you were given antibiotics, correct?"
271,GENHX,patient,"I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me?"
271,GENHX,doctor,Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections.
271,GENHX,patient,I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems.
271,GENHX,doctor,Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped?
271,GENHX,patient,Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same.
271,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's?
271,GENHX,patient,Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan.
271,GENHX,doctor,"Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left."
271,GENHX,patient,"Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me."
271,GENHX,doctor,"No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses?"
271,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked!"
271,GENHX,doctor,I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing?
271,GENHX,patient,"I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop."
271,GENHX,doctor,I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears.
271,GENHX,patient,Sounds good.
271,GENHX,doctor,I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal.
271,GENHX,patient,That's reassuring.
271,GENHX,doctor,I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?
271,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't feel anything like that right now."
271,GENHX,doctor,"Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?"
271,GENHX,patient,Nope. I don't hear anything like that.
271,GENHX,doctor,"We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected?"
271,GENHX,patient,"I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse."
271,GENHX,doctor,Was the medicine called Allegra?
271,GENHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help."
271,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too?
271,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I did."
271,GENHX,doctor,I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs.
271,GENHX,patient,Sounds good.
271,GENHX,doctor,Could you look to the left and then look to the right.
271,GENHX,patient,"Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy."
271,GENHX,doctor,Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.
272,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is there anyone that lives with you at home? You are going to need someone to help you care for your wound.
272,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My wife lives at home with me.  She can help me change my bandages.
273,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Hello. Looks like you're having surgery today.
273,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, I am. I forgot what the surgery was, but it says it in my report."
273,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I'm looking at it right now. Looks like you had a PermCath inserted three times and received peritoneal dialysis
274,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, what is happening with you?"
274,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I had knee replacement for both my knees three years ago and now I am having some pain.
274,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay and in one or both knees?
274,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Both.
274,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay.
275,EDCOURSE,doctor,Hi!
275,EDCOURSE,patient,Hello!
275,EDCOURSE,doctor,How are you feeling now?
275,EDCOURSE,patient,I am feeling okay.
275,EDCOURSE,doctor,"Yeah, looks like your condition is improving."
275,EDCOURSE,patient,"Yes, I think so too."
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,And who are we seeing today?
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Well, hello young man how are you feeling today?"
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,For how long now?
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"No, I mean when did he start complaining of stomach pain?"
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Oh okay, let me check him. Did he have any nausea or vomiting?"
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,And then he is complaining of tummy pain?
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Well, the good part is he is not dehydrated."
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Any diarrhea?
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Hm, but no blood or anything in the stools or vomit?"
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Okay good.
276,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Well, let me run some tests but the signs and symptoms sound like he might have a stomach flu, also called as gastroenteritis in medical terms. I will start him on some medicines and hopefully that should help."
277,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, nice to meet you, miss. I will be taking care of you today. Before we start, can I get to know you a bit? I like to know who I am treating."
277,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hello, nice to meet you. Of course. Um, what can I say? I am a recent widow. My husband passed when we were married for only eight years. I am also retired and loving every minute of it."
277,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I am sorry to hear that, but I am glad you are happy after retirement. Do you celebrate your infinite days off with a drink or a cigarette?"
277,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I do not smoke. I drink occasionally, but it is very rare."
277,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any children that you spend your time with?
277,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have three wonderful children.
278,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What do you use to treat your asthma?
278,MEDICATIONS,patient,I use my Albuterol inhaler.
279,GENHX,doctor,Do you eat three meals a day?
279,GENHX,patient,Yes.
279,GENHX,doctor,Do you think those meals add up to about two thousand calories a day?
279,GENHX,patient,I would say yes.
280,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you still taking Micronase every morning?
280,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I take um two point five M G once a day."
280,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Great. Continue taking Micronase by mouth every day. As for your infection, I want you to start taking Bactrim twice daily. I'll be prescribing you thirty pills. It'll be Bactrim four hundred M G and eighty M G tablets."
281,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you consume any kind of tobacco?
281,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
281,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about smoking?
281,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I've never done it."
281,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any kind of alcohol consumption?
281,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
282,GENHX,doctor,What seems to be the problem today?
282,GENHX,patient,I've been having headaches for a while now.
282,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been having these headaches?
282,GENHX,patient,"Um, I had my first one about two months ago."
282,GENHX,doctor,"Did you suddenly start having them, or was it more gradual?"
282,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'd say it was more gradual."
282,GENHX,doctor,Where do you feel your headaches?
282,GENHX,patient,"Right here, between my eyes."
282,GENHX,doctor,How would you describe your symptoms?
282,GENHX,patient,I'd say it feels like a pressure sensation.
282,GENHX,doctor,What's the intensity of these headaches?
282,GENHX,patient,"Um, they're about moderately severe, I guess."
282,GENHX,doctor,Do these headaches interfere with your ability to do your activities?
282,GENHX,patient,"Yes, they do. My regular activities are significantly more difficult now."
282,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any sinus congestion?
282,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I do. I also have some light sensitivity."
282,GENHX,doctor,Are you stressed out at work?
282,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have a very stressful job, doctor."
282,GENHX,doctor,Are you sleeping well?
282,GENHX,patient,"Well, no not at all. I even try to have a little drink before bed, and it doesn't help."
282,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have any oral symptoms, like vomiting or pain in your jaw?"
282,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that."
283,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any medical conditions that I should know about?
283,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, not that I know of."
283,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, there's no history of depression, or cancer, or high blood pressure?"
283,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, it's not ringing any bells."
284,CC,patient,I am having stomach pain.

286,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Good afternoon, which gender do you identify with?"
286,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor, thank you for asking, I identify as a female."
286,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Great, thank you. Have you ever had surgery on this knee?"
286,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I actually had an A C L reconstruction done in March of two thousand eight. Um, it didn't go well, so they did a revision at the end of that year, in December."

292,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Because I am looking at your previous charts and I don't see it mentioned before.
292,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Oh yeah first time it shot up this high. I never had a high blood pressure problem before.
293,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Now, let's talk about your family history. Have any of them had cancer?"
293,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Actually, yes, I know a few family members have, but I can't remember who had what kind."
293,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's okay. What about heart disease? Can you remember anyone having that?
293,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, that rings some bells."
293,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Thank you, has anyone in your family had a joint replacement?"
293,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I know that a lot of my family has had arthritis in the past, but I can't remember whether or not they had joint replacements, honestly."
294,CC,doctor,"Hi, how are you?"
294,CC,patient,"I am good, how about you?"

295,GENHX,doctor,Has she been lethargic or crying more than normal?
295,GENHX,doctor,Any other changes in her daily routine that you might have noticed?
296,DIAGNOSIS,patient,I am in pain. I get these frequent episodes of pain and discomfort in my head.
296,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Is it in any side of head or is it overall?
296,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Sometimes it is overall and other times just on any one side. Doctor: This sounds like it is a migraine headache.
297,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young man. Is this your mother?"

298,GENHX,patient,"Yes sir, that is."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Good, what do you do for a living?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Right now, I'm a temporary employee for A B C A B C, I've worked for A B C D, too."
298,GENHX,doctor,What do you do there?
298,GENHX,patient,"Mainly, I handle the loading and unloading of furniture and appliances for people's houses."
298,GENHX,doctor,That's hard work. When did you get hurt?
298,GENHX,patient,"It was about two and a half weeks ago now, back in October."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have a history of back problems, like before this injury?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I've had back pain for a long time."
298,GENHX,doctor,What happened when you got hurt this time?
298,GENHX,patient,"I was unloading one of the A B C eighteen wheelers, when I bent down to pick up some boxes, and I felt the pain."
298,GENHX,doctor,What kind of pain did you feel?
298,GENHX,patient,I felt a sharp pain in my lower back right away when I tried to lift those boxes.
298,GENHX,doctor,Does your pain go down your legs?
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it goes into the right side of my butt, and then all the way down the outside of my right leg, like into the knee."
298,GENHX,doctor,How have your symptoms progressed since they began?
298,GENHX,patient,"Doctor, they've only gotten worse."
298,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any pain in your left leg?
298,GENHX,patient,"A little, not as bad as the right."
298,GENHX,doctor,What other symptoms are you having besides the pain down your leg?
298,GENHX,patient,"The muscles in my butt are spazzing, and it's happening more and more."
298,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen another doctor for this?
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I saw Doctor Z at first."
298,GENHX,doctor,What did they do for you?
298,GENHX,patient,"He gave me some muscle relaxers, and some, um, Lidocaine patches."
298,GENHX,doctor,Did this help at all?
298,GENHX,patient,"No, not at all."
298,GENHX,doctor,Who else have you seen?
298,GENHX,patient,"I saw doctor X Y Z too, through worker's comp."
298,GENHX,doctor,When did you see them?
298,GENHX,patient,That was back in April.
298,GENHX,doctor,What did they recommend?
298,GENHX,patient,"Um, he sent me for an M R I, and I have the report for that right here."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, this M R I report is basically negative, which is good. Did he give you any medications?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, he gave me some opioids."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Wow, that's strong stuff. What is your work status right now?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Doctor X Y Z put me on restricted duty status, doctor."
298,GENHX,doctor,"I'm reading your notes from doctor X Y Z, he says he released you in June, and that you have reached maximum medical improvement."
298,GENHX,patient,"He told me that, but I still have pain, so I went back to see him."
298,GENHX,doctor,"When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I did."
298,GENHX,doctor,What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time?
298,GENHX,patient,"He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C."
298,GENHX,doctor,Did you have this done?
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I did."
298,GENHX,doctor,Did this help at all?
298,GENHX,patient,"No, it did absolutely nothing."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have?"
298,GENHX,patient,"I had an M R I, um, E M G, and nerve conduction study with doctor A B C D."
298,GENHX,doctor,Do you have the results of that as well?
298,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, they're right here."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, sir, these tests are essentially normal, which is more good news. What aggravates your pain?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Well, anything like sitting for a long time. When I do that, I feel it in my legs."
298,GENHX,doctor,"When you sit for a long time, is it in both legs?"
298,GENHX,patient,It's really on my right.
298,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to sleep at night?
298,GENHX,patient,"No, sir, I'm not able to sleep at all."
298,GENHX,doctor,Have you been able to return to work?
298,GENHX,patient,"Well, I went back to work in June, after doctor X said I'd reached the maximum medical improvement we talked about."
298,GENHX,doctor,"Finally, have you seen a chiropractor for this pain?"
298,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I saw doctor X about eight or nine times."
298,GENHX,doctor,Did they do anything to help you feel better?
298,GENHX,patient,"Really, no, it did not. I still have the pain down my legs today."
299,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is there any family medical history?
299,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I have a whole list. See, my grand aunt had a stroke. My M G had heart issues same as my mom, who died of a heart attack at sixty three. My father had some sort of cancer. I don't know what exactly. And my sisters have blood pressure issues."
299,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, that sure is a list. Anyone with diabetes?"
299,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No. Well, that is one thing that skipped my family."
300,ALLERGY,doctor,Does he have any known drug allergies?
301,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, can you tell me more about your son, ma'am."

301,GENHX,doctor,Has he remained complaint with his Lamisil?
301,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so we'll do an A L T blood test today."

302,CC,patient,"Yes, I do, multiple."
302,CC,doctor,Go ahead shoot.
302,CC,patient,I have them all written down on this.
303,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How about any drugs, alcohol, or tobacco?"
303,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, no, and no."

305,DISPOSITION,patient,Thank you!
306,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young man, are these your parents?"
306,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor."
306,GENHX,doctor,"Can you tell me more about your son, please?"
306,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, my brother has been doing this too."
306,GENHX,doctor,How many times has he had diarrhea per day since this began?
306,GENHX,doctor,How many times has he thrown up per day?
306,GENHX,doctor,Has he been throwing up today?
306,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't today."
306,GENHX,doctor,Has he gone to the bathroom today?
306,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I peed this morning."
306,GENHX,doctor,Has he had any fever symptoms?
306,GENHX,doctor,Has he eaten any solid food?
306,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had half a hamburger and some milk last night."
306,GENHX,doctor,Was he able to keep the food down?
306,GENHX,doctor,What has he drank?
307,GENHX,doctor,Welcome into the clinic! I would like to start with your past medical history.
307,GENHX,patient,I have high blood pressure and macular deterioration. Last year I caught pneumonia but that has cleared up.
307,GENHX,doctor,Okay.  What brings you in today?
307,GENHX,patient,I have had this cough and pain on the right side of my abdomen.
307,GENHX,doctor,How long has this been going on?
307,GENHX,patient,Two days. I have had body aches and have been feeling nauseous too.
307,GENHX,doctor,Have you had a fever?
307,GENHX,patient,I think so. I was chilled and my forehead was warm. The cough is a dry sounding cough.
307,GENHX,doctor,Does the abdominal pain come during one of these coughing episodes?
307,GENHX,patient,Yes.
308,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, dear, how old are you?"
308,GENHX,patient,I'm fourteen years old.
308,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and what brings you in for a visit today?"
308,GENHX,patient,My left knee hurts really bad.
308,GENHX,doctor,"Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you?"
308,GENHX,patient,"Well, since the fall of two thousand seven."
308,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen another doctor for this?
308,GENHX,patient,"Mom, can you tell the doctor?"
308,GENHX,doctor,"I see, and what did this doctor recommend?"
308,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?"
308,GENHX,doctor,"I see, has she been wearing her brace?"
308,GENHX,doctor,"That's good, and how is your pain today, dear?"
308,GENHX,patient,"P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much."
308,GENHX,doctor,"Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T."
308,GENHX,doctor,"Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee."
308,GENHX,doctor,"It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment."
308,GENHX,doctor,The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
308,GENHX,patient,Will I be asleep for this?
308,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
308,GENHX,patient,Will I need to go back to P T?
308,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling."
308,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer."
309,CC,doctor,What brings you here today?
309,CC,patient,I have pain in my tummy.
309,CC,doctor,When did you first notice it?
309,CC,patient,It started suddenly around noon.
310,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome to the clinic., ma'am"
310,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
310,GENHX,doctor,What brings you into see me?
310,GENHX,patient,I have been struggling with pain and stiffness in my right neck and shoulder.
310,GENHX,doctor,How long has this been going on for?
310,GENHX,patient,Maybe for about four months.
310,GENHX,doctor,In these past four months have your symptoms becomes worse or has it improved at all?
310,GENHX,patient,It has been getting worse. The pain is worse at night. It wakes me up at night. I haven't had a good night sleep in four months.
310,GENHX,doctor,"Have you experienced any pain or numbness in your arm, wrist, or hand?"
310,GENHX,patient,"Yes! About two weeks after the pain started, I was having some numbness and painful cramping in these two fingers here."
310,GENHX,doctor,The right hand and the first and second finger?
310,GENHX,patient,Yes.
310,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
310,GENHX,patient,I am forty six.

310,GENHX,patient,Right. It was a throbbing pain in my hand.
310,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any other pain anywhere else in your body?
310,GENHX,patient,I few times I had some numbness in both of my legs. It started with a pinching from my tailbone area.
310,GENHX,doctor,"Did you experience any trauma neck, head or back?"
310,GENHX,patient,"No. I don't know where this pain came from. Oh, every once and a while I have this electric shock like sensation shooting down my spine when move my neck certain way."
310,GENHX,doctor,Any pain or symptoms in your left arm or shoulder?
310,GENHX,patient,No.
310,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any visual changes or disturbances?
310,GENHX,patient,No.
310,GENHX,doctor,Any difficulties with your bowels or your bladder?
310,GENHX,patient,No.
310,GENHX,doctor,Have you been taking any thing for the pain?
310,GENHX,patient,I have been taking Naprosyn.
310,GENHX,doctor,Has the Naprosyn help relieve your pain?
310,GENHX,patient,Only a little bit.
310,GENHX,doctor,Okay.

311,GYNHX,doctor,Any abnormal pap smears?
311,GYNHX,patient,"No, fortunately they've all been normal."
311,GYNHX,doctor,That's wonderful to hear. And my last question for you is if you've ever gotten a mammogram?
311,GYNHX,patient,I haven't gotten one before. Do I need to get one? I just turned thirty nine. What's the recommended age again?
311,GYNHX,doctor,"It depends. For example, the recommended age would be younger for someone who has a family history of breast cancer. Given that you don't have a positive family history of breast cancer, I'd advise getting one in a few years at the age of forty five."
312,DISPOSITION,doctor,"Okay, I want you to follow up with our hand therapist Doctor X at her A B C D office in one to two weeks."
312,DISPOSITION,patient,"Okay, I will make an appointment today."
313,CC,doctor,So we're here to follow up on a few things. I'd like to know how you're keeping up with your blood sugar checks.
313,CC,patient,I've been checking my blood sugar one to two times a day.
313,CC,doctor,Have you been keeping a log?
313,CC,patient,"Uh yeah, but I need to be better at it."
313,CC,doctor,Do you have the log with you today?
313,CC,patient,"Yep, in fact it's right here. Let me grab it for you."
313,CC,doctor,Great.
313,CC,patient,Here ya go.
313,CC,doctor,Thank you. And have you been watching your cholesterol intake since getting blood work done? Your labs show your cholesterol levels are a bit elevated. I'd like for you to monitor your cholesterol and go in for another set of labs before our next visit.
313,CC,patient,Do I need to fast for it again?
313,CC,doctor,"Yes, you'll need to fast. I'd recommend going in early in the morning before eating any breakfast."
313,CC,patient,That sounds like a good plan.
313,CC,doctor,"And as for your sinusitis, how have you been feeling since finishing your course of antibiotics?"
313,CC,patient,Much better. No more headaches and a stuffy nose.
314,GENHX,doctor,What brings you in today?

314,GENHX,patient,I just started coughing and now I have a fever.
314,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any history of kidney stones?
314,GENHX,patient,Yes.  I had kidney stones less than a year ago.  I had a urinary tract infection at the same time.  It was awful.

316,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Do you smoke?
316,GENHX,patient,No.
317,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. The nurse who seated you tells me you are here for a second opinion on surgery."
317,GENHX,patient,"Hello, doctor. Yes, I have been told that both eyes need cataract extraction. I came for a second opinion because I will only have surgery if necessary. I am nervous."
317,GENHX,doctor,What is the reason for the extraction?
317,GENHX,patient,I am not exactly sure because the other doctors said a bunch of medical terms. I have had laser in my eyes though. That was for macular degeneration. Doctor X said I had neurovascular age-related macular degeneration.
317,GENHX,doctor,Do you know what laser you had on your eyes?
317,GENHX,patient,No. I just know laser was done by Doctor X four times to the macula on the right and two times on the left.
318,ALLERGY,doctor,Any allergies?

356,GENHX,doctor,How about wet and dirty diapers?
356,GENHX,doctor,How about any diarrhea?

359,EDCOURSE,patient,"Yes, with medication I feel it is better, but I want to be removed from the backboard."
359,EDCOURSE,doctor,"Okay, let's get you off. Yeah, your C T scans of the abdomen appeared normal.  And there was no sign of bleeding.  I believe, you just have a contusion and abrasion to abdomen from the seatbelt and likely from the airbag as well."
359,EDCOURSE,patient,Oh okay.
359,EDCOURSE,doctor,It's good that you can stand and walk through the emergency department without difficulty. I do not see any abrasions or lacerations.
359,EDCOURSE,patient,"Yeah, nothing like that and I can walk."

373,ASSESSMENT,doctor,That is great. Keep me updated on her progress.  Her bloodwork came back showing an underactive thyroid. This explains the recent weight gain and fatigue. I would like to start her on a medication called levothyroxine. We will need to check her bloodwork again in one month to see how her thyroid respond to the medication.
373,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Is there any other concerns you have today?
373,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Let me look. Can you remove your socks for me?
373,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yes.
373,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Is it this nail?
373,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"This is very common. It is called Onychomycosis. It is nail fungus. Since only one nail is affected, I would recommend starting off with a topical treatment. I will send the drops to your pharmacy. You will put on drop on the affected nail, daily."

377,GENHX,doctor,Is your heart beating alright? Do you feel like it is beating too fast or hard?
377,GENHX,patient,"No. I can't really feel my heart beat normally, but I guess that is better than feeling it beat constantly."

378,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I feel like I've tried everything in the book and I still can't break the habit. One of my buddies was telling me about this medicine called Clantix or something like that."
378,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I've heard of Chantix. We can look into it and see what's best fit."
378,GENHX,patient,"Okay, great. Since moving back home, I've ran out of Xanax."
378,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been taking it?

380,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
380,GENHX,doctor,"So, your primary care physician sent you here for possible hydrocephalus."

380,GENHX,doctor,What do you notice about the way your wife's walk that has changed?
380,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Have you noticed her stabilizing herself all of a sudden?
380,GENHX,doctor,What else have you noticed about the way she walks?
380,GENHX,doctor,That is good that you are taking your time. Do you use any devices to assist you to get around? Like a cane or a walker?
380,GENHX,patient,No.
380,GENHX,patient,I have had one emergency room visit.
380,GENHX,doctor,What happened that you had to go to the emergency room?
380,GENHX,patient,I fell. I was walking to the bedroom. I lost my balance so I put my hand out to brace myself against the wall and my hand slipped. I fell on my wrist.
380,GENHX,doctor,When did this fall happen?
380,GENHX,patient,March two thousand and seven.
380,GENHX,doctor,I can see why that would make you nervous. Have you had any headaches?

392,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals."
392,GENHX,doctor,How are you doing at work with your mood swings?
392,GENHX,patient,"Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues."
392,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?
392,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket."
392,GENHX,doctor,Do you know what you were diagnosed with?
392,GENHX,patient,"It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again."
392,GENHX,doctor,"Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?"
392,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket."
392,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever been on antidepressants?
392,GENHX,patient,No.
392,GENHX,doctor,Any hot flashes or night sweat? Did you ever find yourself waking up to wet bed due to sweating?
392,GENHX,patient,No.
392,GENHX,doctor,"Just putting together all that you have told me here. You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?"
392,GENHX,patient,"Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!"
392,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I understand. Anything else that I should be aware of?"
392,GENHX,patient,"Oh yeah, the insomnia, I am hardly sleeping. At times I feel like a zombie."
392,GENHX,doctor,Any surgeries in the past?
392,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had some complications and they had to remove my complete uterus along with tubes and ovaries."
392,GENHX,doctor,Oh! When was this?
392,GENHX,patient,In the December of two thousand and three.
393,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any known past medical history?
393,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I have high blood pressure.
393,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Anything else?
393,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, I remember I also had higher number of fat in my blood."
394,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am, welcome in. I believe this is our first time meeting."
394,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, this is my first time in."
394,GENHX,doctor,"Great, how old are you?"
394,GENHX,patient,"I'm fifty five, doctor."
394,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
394,GENHX,patient,"Well, I'm having a laundry list of symptoms coinciding with my allergies."
394,GENHX,doctor,"Like what, ma'am?"
394,GENHX,patient,"Well, my sense of taste is diminished, dry mouth, um, acid reflux, and G I issues, and then I have asthma, and reactions to things like aerosols."
394,GENHX,doctor,"I see, do you have any food allergies?"
394,GENHX,patient,"Um, I think."
395,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What's your family history?
395,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Both my parents are deceased.
395,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear that. I offer you my sincerest condolences.
395,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. My dad passed away at seventy five from leukemia and my mom fell victim to heart problems and alcoholism at thirty eight.
395,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Does anyone else in your family suffer from leukemia, cardiac problems, or alcohol abuse?"
395,FAM/SOCHX,patient,One of my uncles on my dad's side was recently diagnosed with leukemia.
395,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. I see."
396,ROS,doctor,Any fever or chills?
396,ROS,patient,No.
396,ROS,doctor,Any headache or body pains?

396,ROS,doctor,Any nausea vomiting?
396,ROS,patient,I had vomiting a few times.
396,ROS,doctor,Did you observe any blood?
396,ROS,patient,No.
396,ROS,doctor,"Okay, any diarrhea?"
396,ROS,patient,"No, on the contrary I am having constipation every now and then, it's really bothering me now. I feel bloated all the time and don't feel fresh in the morning or throughout the day."
396,ROS,doctor,"Oh, how long have you had this problem?"
396,ROS,patient,Couple of months now.
396,ROS,doctor,"Hm, I see, does it hurt you to pass stool? Did you notice any blood?"
396,ROS,patient,No. I use suppositories.
396,ROS,doctor,"Oh, that's great. You are doing the right thing. In addition to that I will prescribe you some strong laxative you can drink that in morning it should help."
396,ROS,patient,Okay!
396,ROS,doctor,Any complains of heart burn or acidity or stomach pain?
396,ROS,patient,"No, not really. I do get this twisty pain in my stomach sometimes which I think is mainly due to my constipation."
396,ROS,doctor,"Yeah, you can get that kind of pain with constipation. Any cough or cold like symptoms? Any cough with sputum?"
396,ROS,patient,"No, I feel fine."
396,ROS,doctor,"Okay, basically I don't think you have any stomach ulcer or anything, but we need to treat your constipation because I know it can be really uncomfortable."
397,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Do you take Diovan, estradiol, Norvasc, Wellbutrin?"
397,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, and the Wellbutrin is an inhaler."

398,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
398,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How long have you and your husband been married?
398,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, at this point I don't even know how long its been."
398,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I assume you live together?
398,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, we do."
398,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for a living?
398,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm a school nurse for the School Department. I love working with the children.
398,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's wonderful. Do you drink or smoke?
398,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't drink, and I quit smoking cigarettes about twenty five years ago."
398,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Good for you.
399,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,It looks like she had an appendectomy along with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy sometime ago.
399,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Oh and it looks like she had a right hip fracture back in O five after a fall.
400,GENHX,doctor,"Before we begin today, sir, I just need a few pieces of background information. I see here on my chart that you're thirty years old, is that correct?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Yes doctor, that's correct."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and which hand is your dominant hand?"
400,GENHX,patient,I use my right hand for everything.
400,GENHX,doctor,"Now, take me through the timeline of your symptoms, please. When did everything start?"
400,GENHX,patient,I was doing well until July of nineteen ninety three.
400,GENHX,doctor,What were your initial symptoms?
400,GENHX,patient,"I began having weakness in my right arm, and there was some neck pain too."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, when these symptoms began, how did you manage them?"
400,GENHX,patient,"At first, I went to a chiropractor, but after a while my arm started atrophying, and my right hand felt tight. I couldn't extend all my fingers out."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Once you noticed the atrophy and contractures, that's the tightness you were experiencing, how were you treated?"
400,GENHX,patient,"After that, I went to a neurosurgeon close to my house, and he ordered an, um, C T scan of my neck."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, do you have the report of that C T Scan with you today?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, I have it right here. They were one on the twenty fifth of September in ninety two."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, okay, this shows an intramedullary lesion at C two three, and an extramedullary lesion at C six seven."
400,GENHX,patient,"That means tumor, right?"
400,GENHX,doctor,Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?
400,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I have the op notes right here."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, just so you know, you had a C six T one laminectomy, and they decompressed the spinal cord. How did you respond to this surgery?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Well, honestly, I improved for about three months following the operation, but after that I just got worse and worse."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Once your symptoms worsened, what happened?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Um, I started having this burning sensation on my left side."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Did you have any weakness, sir?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had weakness in both my arms."
400,GENHX,doctor,Was one side worse than the other?
400,GENHX,patient,"Yes, my right side was worse than my left."
400,GENHX,doctor,"In addition to the burning and weakness, did you have any other symptoms?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Um, I had really bad balance, I felt nauseous, like I was going to throw up at all times, which I did do some, and, um, my heart was beating really fast, and my blood pressure went up really high."
400,GENHX,doctor,"After all these symptoms began, how were you treated?"
400,GENHX,patient,"On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa."
400,GENHX,patient,"Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?"
400,GENHX,doctor,"Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma."
400,GENHX,patient,"That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms?"
400,GENHX,patient,"I felt good, the doctors said I stabilized out. I went through some radiation procedures from September of ninety three to January nineteenth of ninety four."
400,GENHX,doctor,How have your symptoms progressed since?
400,GENHX,patient,"I went to the NeuroOncology clinic on October twenty sixth nineteen ninety five because I was having weakness in both arms and both legs, as well as trouble swallowing food."
400,GENHX,doctor,How much weakness was there?
400,GENHX,patient,"It was so bad I couldn't even put on a shirt, or raise my arms, or even feed myself."
400,GENHX,doctor,Can you go up and down stairs?
400,GENHX,patient,"No, not really, but I can climb them."
400,GENHX,doctor,"How about going to the bathroom, is everything normal there?"
400,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, no problems there."
400,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and what did the doctor at that clinic recommend?"
400,GENHX,patient,They were considering doing chemo.
401,ALLERGY,doctor,Any other allergies besides Penicillin?
401,ALLERGY,patient,Um no.
401,ALLERGY,doctor,I see here that you've previously tolerated Cephalosporins without any problems. Do you remember when you were last prescribed a Penicillin like antibiotic?
402,CC,doctor,Where are you having pain?
402,CC,patient,My left elbow. I hit it against a railing when I was trying to do a new trick on my skateboard.
402,CC,doctor,Did the pain come on gradually?
402,CC,patient,"Yeah. I even tried icing it, but I think it's only gotten worse."
402,CC,doctor,Did you injure any other parts of your body?
402,CC,patient,Only my elbow.
402,CC,doctor,How long ago did this happen?
402,CC,patient,About a week ago.
402,CC,doctor,"I see. Have you taken anything for it, such as Advil or Tylenol?"
402,CC,patient,No. I try to deal with the pain as best as I can before resorting to medicine.
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, doc."
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about smoke?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,That I do.
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How long have you been smoking?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I long time.
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you tried to quit or reduce how much you smoke?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Truly, I have no interest in doing that with my age."
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. I'd recommend you consider nicotine patches because smoking brings with it many health problems.
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Tell me something I don't know.
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I understand. How about any other drug use?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I know you're not going to like hearing this, but I'm big on weed. I know, I know, I'm going to regret all of this at some point in time. It's just become a habit that's incredibly hard to break."
403,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. I'd rather you smoke weed than cigs. How many packs a year do you think you smoke on average?
403,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I go through a pack around every two weeks. Let's go with around twenty seven.
404,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,How about any surgeries?
404,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, I have not had any surgeries."
404,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Are you sure?
404,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yes.
405,GYNHX,doctor,Welcome to the clinic.

405,GYNHX,patient,"Yes, I am."
405,GYNHX,doctor,Do you have any other children?
405,GYNHX,patient,Yes. I have a two year old son.
405,GYNHX,doctor,Have you ever had any pregnancies? Including miscarriages or abortions.
405,GYNHX,patient,Yes. I had a miscarriage before my son was born.
405,GYNHX,doctor,I am so sorry to hear that.
405,GYNHX,patient,Thank you.

406,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What does that mean?
406,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was an attorney but retired from my official post two years back. I just couldn't stay back home and do nothing, so I just joined a private company and am working there part time."
406,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Sounds great. Do you smoke or drink?
406,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.

406,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Correct.
407,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,When did you stop smoking?
407,FAM/SOCHX,patient,About thirty years back.

407,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yes, please tell me son."
407,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Okay. Yes, that."

407,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't remember maybe more than twenty years.
408,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
408,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, not that I can remember, and I have a good memory."

412,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
412,GENHX,doctor,"Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir?"
412,GENHX,patient,"Well, I think I'm having some sexual dysfunction. I was wondering if Cialis would help."
412,GENHX,doctor,"What makes you think this, sir?"
412,GENHX,patient,"Well, I did a quiz online on the Cialis website and I didn't score in the normal range, so I figured I would come in."
412,GENHX,doctor,"Is there anything else of note, sir?"
412,GENHX,patient,"Well, there may be some decreased desire, but honestly, I don't think that's the main problem here. I'd like to have my erections last longer, doctor."
412,GENHX,doctor,What was this quiz like?
412,GENHX,patient,"Well, on the quiz, I said that less than half of the time I'm able to get an erection and keep an erection after penetration."

412,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any traumatic injuries to the groin?
412,GENHX,patient,"No, not that I can remember."
412,GENHX,doctor,What about hernias? You can get them from playing sports or lifting weights. Have you ever had one of these?
412,GENHX,patient,"No, that doesn't sound familiar either."
413,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"We were not able to find the cause of your pain right now, but in the future, we will do a few more tests and then we can have a diagnosis."
413,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Will you give me some medicine for my stomach pain? And what about that feeling to throw up all of the time?
413,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Yes, I will write a prescription. It will help you both with your pain and nausea."
414,ASSESSMENT,doctor,You had a bad acidity problem?
414,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yes I was vomiting too.

415,ROS,doctor,How long have you been feeling weakness and fatigue?

415,ROS,patient,"I've lost about eight pounds, which is the most I've ever lost in a week's time."
415,ROS,doctor,"Wow, that's concerning. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain?"
415,ROS,patient,No.
415,ROS,doctor,"How about chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or heart racing?"
415,ROS,patient,No.
415,ROS,doctor,"Any neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling?"
415,ROS,patient,No.
415,ROS,doctor,We'll get to the bottom of this. I'm waiting for your lab report to come back and then we can figure out the next steps.
416,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I see here that you have no surgical history. Is this correct?
416,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, indeed. At least for now. Who knows what the future will bring."
417,GENHX,doctor,"So, sir, tell me about your knees, how long have they been bothering you?"
417,GENHX,patient,"Well, I'm sixty nine years old now, so I'm not as young as I used to be. But, these old knees have been bothering me for a couple years now."
417,GENHX,doctor,What kind of symptoms do you notice in these knees?
417,GENHX,patient,"I hear clicking noises, which really bothers me when I'm going up stairs. There's also some stiffness when I try to move them."
417,GENHX,doctor,Were you previously a pretty active guy?
417,GENHX,patient,"I absolutely used to be, and had no problems, but now this pain is affecting my daily life and activities."
418,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You smoke or drink?
418,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope, I never did any such thing."
418,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any drugs?
418,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Never.
418,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you still working?
418,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm retired. I used to work. I used to work in Morse chain. I also used to deliver newspapers. But now I'm retired, and I enjoy life."
418,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
418,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I was happily married. But then my husband died.
418,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you live alone or with family?
418,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I live alone. I do have family who lives very close by in the neighborhood. I have a niece who lives with her family in my house on Temple Street.
419,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"As far as you know, is there any family history of cancer?"
419,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, actually, my mom told me that someone had cervical cancer."
419,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What about heart disease, does that sound familiar?"
419,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I know someone had heart disease, and another person had heart failure."
419,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good to know, what about the lungs, any history there?"
419,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I know someone had C O P D.
419,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of anyone with dementia or Alzheimer's?
419,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, my uncle has dementia right now, actually."
419,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'm sorry to hear that, that's a hard disease to see your family go through. What about diabetes, does anyone have that?"
419,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you doctor, it's hard. Yes, my dad has the sugar."
420,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Can you give me a quick run down of her medical history?
420,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that.
420,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,When was she diagnosed with dementia?
420,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Any history of heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?"
421,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hi, there. How are you both doing? What brings you two to the Emergency Department?"
421,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I see. Let me ask your daughter a few questions before we start. Hi, ma'am. I understand you feel sick. Before we begin I just want to confirm some information with you. Where is your primary residency?"
421,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mom can give you the address. I still live with her.
421,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Thank you. One last question. Do you smoke?
421,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope. My Mother has forbidden smoking in her home.
422,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, sir?"
422,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I'm lucky to have, and live with my lovely wife."
422,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's very nice. Did you speak with the nurse before I came in here?
422,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, she was lovely as well, I hope you're paying them well."
422,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"We take good care of them. They'll be happy to hear that. Let me look, she should have left me some notes, um, yep, these look good, I agree with all of this. This looks good."
422,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you, Doctor."
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hi. How are you doing, sir?"
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hi. I am doing fine.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,The nurse told me that you are on disability from work now. What happened?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I got hurt at work and now I am on disability.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What did you do for work? How long ago was your injury?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I worked on the pipeline. The accident was five years ago.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Which condition led to the disability?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't know really. I sent in all the notes for my doctor for evaluation and they approved the disability.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. Do you live alone or with family?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I live with my wife.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you a smoke or have you ever been?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I used to smoke. I quit years ago.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How long ago did you quit?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, about twenty years ago."
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How many years did you smoke? And how much did you smoke?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Probably twenty years. I was up to two packs a day. I feel way better now.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's great. Any use of alcohol or illicit drugs?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for fun? Do you have any hobbies?
423,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't really do much these days. Work was my hobby.
423,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
424,GENHX,doctor,How're you doing today?
424,GENHX,patient,"Overall, pretty good."
424,GENHX,doctor,Any plans for the weekend?
424,GENHX,patient,"No, not really. Just dog sitting my friend's golden."
424,GENHX,doctor,Gotcha. That's still nice. We used to have a golden when I was a kid. They're the sweetest dogs.
424,GENHX,patient,They are very sweet.
424,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so you're in for a follow up for your neck and back pain."
424,GENHX,patient,Yessir.
424,GENHX,doctor,Have you been going to pain management?
424,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I go once every week or so."
424,GENHX,doctor,How's your pain now?
424,GENHX,patient,"Manageable, I guess."
424,GENHX,doctor,Is the pain still keeping you up at night?
424,GENHX,patient,Not like it used to.
424,GENHX,doctor,"Good, great to hear."
425,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Let's see. Are you taking any medications?
425,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, none right now."
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I smoke.
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you smoke per day?
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,About a pack or two a day.
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink alcohol?
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. It is very rare that I will have a drink.
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I don't know very much about my dad's side of the family but my dad did pass away from renal cancer."
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry for your loss.
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
426,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your mother or siblings? Do they have any health conditions?
426,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. They don't have any health problems. That I know of.
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, ma'am, what do you do for a living?"
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Actually, I'm retired, I don't work at all anymore."
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Congratulations on your retirement. Where did you go to college?
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, I didn't go to college, I stopped after high school."
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's understandable. Do you have children?
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, my husband and I were blessed with three wonderful children."
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Fantastic, do they live at home?"
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope, we got them all out of there. They're all grown now."
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink or smoke?
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I never had either."
427,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about harder substances?
427,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, absolutely not."
428,EXAM,doctor,You are five feet four inches.
428,EXAM,patient,Yes.
428,EXAM,doctor,Weight one ninety seven.
428,EXAM,patient,Okay.
428,EXAM,doctor,Your blood pressure is one twenty five over seventy five.
428,EXAM,patient,Okay.
429,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
429,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Never smoked a cigarette a day in my life. As for alcohol, I'll drink socially with friends and family."
430,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,How's he feeling today?
430,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that he hasn't been feeling well. What symptoms has he been having?
430,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,I see. What was his temperature?
430,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Let me evaluate and see what we can do for him today.
430,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"I suspect that he has an upper respiratory infection, possible pertussis. Is he still experiencing apnea?"
431,EXAM,doctor,"Okay, let me quickly examine him. Mom do you give the permission? I will quickly check his genitalia. Can you pull his pants down?"
431,EXAM,doctor,"Well, everything looks fine, his penis and testes are normal shape and size for his age. No fluid accumulation or swelling in the scrotum area, no evidence of herniation there."
432,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,We can release you from the hospital today if we have a safe place for you to go. Is there a parent or guardian we can release you to?
432,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am in foster care. My foster mom is going out of town on the nineteenth to the twenty third.
432,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"In that case, we will have to keep you in the hospital until your foster mom returns from her trip."
432,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Can my mom and grandmother come and visit me here on Thursday? That is the day they usually come to visit me at my foster home.
432,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Yes. I think we can make some arrangements to make that happen.
433,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know about any medical issues running in your family?
433,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, almost everyone had diabetes."
434,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any past or present medical conditions?
434,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No.
435,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have any family history of lung disease, thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, stroke, or heart disease."
435,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.  My parents are healthy with no medical issues.

435,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My children are all healthy with no medical problems.
436,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
436,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
437,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of any medical problems that run in your family?
437,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have no idea to be quite honest with you. My parents never shared their medical history with me and neither did their parents with them. I don't think they want any of us to worry.
437,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh wow, I understand. It can be hard for many people to share intimate details about their health to others, even when it comes to disclosing medical info to their own children. For now, I'll put unknown but please let me know if anything changes."
437,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Will do. Thanks for understanding.
437,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Of course. It's not totally uncommon for people to not know their family history.
438,GENHX,doctor,"Hello again, how are you doing, miss?"
438,GENHX,patient,I'm good. Thank you. How about you?
438,GENHX,doctor,"All good here too. I know you are an established patient of dermatology here and was last seen in our office on July thirteenth, two thousand and four.  I will be asking you a few questions just to check whether the entry in our record is updated or not."
438,GENHX,doctor,How old are you now?
438,GENHX,patient,Twenty nine.
438,GENHX,doctor,Where are you from originally?
438,GENHX,patient,I'm from Vietnam.
438,GENHX,doctor,I am seeing you today as a referral from A B C for reevaluation.
438,GENHX,patient,"Yes, for my hand eczema."
438,GENHX,doctor,"So, let's see what you have been treated with. Your record here says with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion. Does this sound right to you?"
438,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
438,GENHX,doctor,Are you washing your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion?
438,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I'm doing all that."
438,GENHX,doctor,What brings you here today?
438,GENHX,patient,"I'm having this flaring. My hands are all dry. I have these like cracks in my hands. I have been washing with the soap and the lotions that you prescribed, but still, it is happening. Maybe because of cracks or what, I don't know, but the Cetaphil cleansing lotion, whenever I'm applying that it is causing me a lot of burning pain. I have been wearing gloves though."
438,GENHX,doctor,Are you married?
438,GENHX,patient,"Still, a single. I'm not even looking for a husband yet."
438,GENHX,doctor,Are you working somewhere?
438,GENHX,patient,Not currently.
439,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"You have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, right? For how many years?"
439,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um, I would say around four years now. Oh my God it has been so, so many medications that I had to take for this."
439,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yeah, it's hard to control. Are you diabetic?"
439,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I don't have any such conditions."
439,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,So no hypertension or any kidney diseases?
439,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
439,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Every been diagnosed with tuberculosis, asthma, or lung disease?"
439,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No I have not.
440,PLAN,doctor,Hm how would you describe her diet?
440,PLAN,doctor,Does she eat solid food?
440,PLAN,doctor,I see.

441,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes, it's been happening for the last several months. Sometimes I feel hot even in a fully air conditioned room. Other times I just feel like opening the refrigerator and standing in front of it."
441,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Any other symptoms?
441,ASSESSMENT,patient,I am also experiencing a lot of mood swings for the last few weeks.
441,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Based on all the symptoms my assessment would be mood swings along with postsurgical menopause. That would be the cause for your hot flashes.
442,ROS,doctor,Any change in appetite?
442,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
442,ROS,doctor,Any stomach pain or change in bowel movement?
442,ROS,patient,No.

442,ROS,doctor,Any liver issues or jaundice?
442,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
442,ROS,doctor,Okay.
443,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink alcohol?
443,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope! I use to occasionally, very long time ago. But not anymore."
443,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay and how bout cigarettes? Do you smoke or vape?
443,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, none of those."
443,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And no drugs and stuff, right? No snorting, I V or anything right?"
443,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Right, I don't do drugs either, never did. Even though pot is legal here, I never ever felt like trying."
443,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's a good thing.
443,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah.
444,EXAM,doctor,"Let me check your neck, it looks nice and symmetrical. Your thyroid looks normal it is not enlarged."
444,EXAM,doctor,Does it hurt you when I press on your neck?
444,EXAM,patient,No.
444,EXAM,doctor,Neck is nontender.
444,EXAM,doctor,"Okay, I don't see any bulging of external jugular vein."
444,EXAM,patient,These medical terms I don't understand.
444,EXAM,doctor,"Oh, I am talking about the vein in your neck, it shows no bulging. No abnormal masses present. Can you turn your head from left to right and right to left, any pain in your neck or difficulty turning?"
444,EXAM,patient,No.
444,EXAM,doctor,Can you rotate your head clockwise and anti clockwise.
444,EXAM,patient,Sure.
444,EXAM,doctor,Any pain?
444,EXAM,patient,No.
444,EXAM,doctor,"Okay, let me just make a note here full range of motion with no pain."
445,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. It looks like you are here for your yearly physical. How is everything going?"
445,GENHX,patient,"Great, I think. I just got a mammogram and nothing showed up. I still am taking my multivitamin and low dose aspirin."
445,GENHX,doctor,Great to hear. Has there been any changes in drinking and smoking?
445,GENHX,patient,"No changes. Check the chart, I answered that last time."
445,GENHX,doctor,"Great. Looks like drinking and smoking is off the menu. In regard to the mammogram, do you make sure to do self breast examinations? I believe I showed you how to do this last time."
445,GENHX,patient,"No, I do not. I don't see a point if I come and do the mammogram."
445,GENHX,doctor,I highly suggest you start doing so. Sometimes people do not get mammograms for a few years and it is important to make sure nothing is growing.
445,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I know. I am just lazy. Recently it has been hard to do a lot of my selfcare routines. I do not even exercise anymore."

447,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I am fine, thank you. So, she gets seizures?"
447,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And when did it start?
447,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Dad I was fourteen, when it started."
447,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Fourteen, okay. Are you taking anything for it?"
447,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anybody else in the family have a similar problem?
447,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, any other siblings or family members with medical conditions?"

450,ROS,doctor,Do you have urine bag?
450,ROS,patient,"Yes, I could not go so they put it in."
450,ROS,doctor,"Yes, it looks like five hundred M L came out. So possible urinary obstruction. Also, they started you on steroids and colchicine. How are you feeling now?"
450,ROS,patient,"I am feeling a little better, my pain is improving, and the swelling is getting better."
450,ROS,doctor,Okay that is good. Any fever and chills?
450,ROS,patient,"No, no fever."
450,ROS,doctor,Any problem with urination like pain or frequency or blood in urine?
450,ROS,patient,"No but I am not able to empty my bladder well, the pee has decreased a lot, I could not urinate."
450,ROS,doctor,"Okay I will evaluate that. How about any cough, blood in sputum?"
450,ROS,patient,No nothing like that.
450,ROS,doctor,"Any chest pain, or difficulty breathing?"

454,ROS,doctor,Anything else that is going on?
454,ROS,patient,Just some pain in the buttock.
454,ROS,doctor,Okay.
454,ROS,patient,I do not have anything else.
454,ROS,doctor,"Okay no fever, nausea, anything of that sort?"
454,ROS,patient,Nope.
455,GENHX,doctor,"You recently turned sixty seven, correct?"
455,GENHX,patient,Yes. Sixty seven years young.
455,GENHX,doctor,Are you right or left handed?
455,GENHX,patient,Right.
455,GENHX,doctor,When were you first diagnosed with Parkinson's?
455,GENHX,patient,September first of nineteen ninety five.
455,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember who diagnosed you?
455,GENHX,patient,"A local doctor I was seeing at the time. A year before my diagnosis, I had a few falls and episodes of lightheadedness. I also noticed that I was staggering a lot more when walking."
455,GENHX,doctor,Did you lose consciousness during any of your falls?
455,GENHX,patient,"Not that I know of. I had noticed that I was losing my normal voice to a degree. On top of losing my normal voice, my handwriting became smaller and smaller. I don't ever remember writing so small. Something seemed really off to me."
455,GENHX,doctor,I'm sure that was difficult to experience.
455,GENHX,patient,"It was very difficult. Two months prior to being diagnosed, I started to move much slower than before."
455,GENHX,doctor,"By slower, do you mean the movements of your arms and legs were slower and impaired?"
455,GENHX,patient,Yes. I was prescribed Sinemet back in September of nineteen ninety five.
455,GENHX,doctor,Did you notice any improvement while taking it?
455,GENHX,patient,None. I was pretty disappointed and discouraged as a result. I have problems with coordination and walking without staggering even today.
455,GENHX,doctor,Noting that it's February thirteenth nineteen ninety six.
455,GENHX,patient,I felt weak in the morning and worse as the day went on.
455,GENHX,doctor,"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as stroke like events, vision changes, seizures, or problems with moving and coordinating your arms?"
455,GENHX,patient,No.
455,GENHX,doctor,"Any headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, or fever?"
455,GENHX,patient,No.
456,GENHX,doctor,Hi there! How are the both of you doing today?
456,GENHX,doctor,What are his symptoms?
456,GENHX,doctor,"During his coughing episode this morning, did you notice any loss of breath or gasping for air?"
456,GENHX,doctor,Has he had a runny nose?
456,GENHX,doctor,Any fever?
456,GENHX,doctor,Is anyone else in the household sick?
456,GENHX,doctor,Is anyone in the household a smoker?
457,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any medical diseases in the family?
457,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, mainly heart issues. My father died from heart attack."
457,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your mother?
457,FAM/SOCHX,patient,She had the second type of diabetes.
458,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,So just to double check. No past medical history?

462,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Do you get belly pain?
462,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yes.
463,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me?"
463,GENHX,patient,"Well, doctor, I'm sixty six years old now."
463,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so, how is your knee doing today? Hope the osteoarthritis is getting better."
463,GENHX,patient,"It's so bad, doctor."
463,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any improvement with the rest and antiinflammatories we've talked about before?
463,GENHX,patient,"No, they haven't helped at all."
463,GENHX,doctor,"I see, you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement."
463,GENHX,patient,What's the risk of infection from the surgery?
463,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
463,GENHX,patient,"Great, and will I be asleep for this?"
463,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
464,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
464,GENHX,patient,I am twenty four.
464,GENHX,doctor,What brings you in today?
464,GENHX,patient,I have been having this back pain for a long time. I thought I should come and get it checked out because it has not gotten any better.
465,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any medical issues running in your family?
465,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't know anything about that.
465,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You know anyone in your family or relatives who ever had diseases like diabetes or any heart issues?
465,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
466,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. Could you verify your age, please?"
466,GENHX,patient,I'm fifty five years old.
466,GENHX,doctor,Great. What is the reason for your visit today?
466,GENHX,patient,"I've been having a lot of problems recently, so I decided to come get it checked out by you."
466,GENHX,doctor,I see. What kind of problems are you experiencing?
466,GENHX,patient,"Oh, it's a long list. Here it is."
466,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Let me take a look. Looks like you have some general allergies and food allergies, loss of taste, problems with your G I tract, asthma, G E R D, and dry mouth or xerostomia."
466,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I forgot to add it, but I also have bad allergies during the spring time."
466,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I see. I would describe that as environmental inhalant allergies."
467,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you a smoker?
467,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
467,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use alcohol or any recreational drugs?
467,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have been in treatment for heroin and alcohol in the past.
467,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any current use of drugs or alcohol?
467,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I did do a little bit of coke today.
467,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
468,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Do you take any-
468,MEDICATIONS,patient,Meds?
468,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Yes.
468,MEDICATIONS,patient,I do. I take Allegra for seasonal allergies. I also take something that starts with a P. I'm blanking on the name. My other doctor prescribed it to me for exercise induced asthma.
468,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Oh, do you mean Proventil?"
468,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, that's it! I keep that on hand in case my asthma gets outta control."
468,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Is it up to date?
468,MEDICATIONS,patient,"You mean is it expired? No, I don't think so. It hasn't been long since I visited the pharmacy."
468,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Good. I always like to advise my patients to check expiration dates.
469,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome into the office.
469,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
469,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let us start with your family medical history.
469,FAM/SOCHX,patient,That is going to be a hard one. I was adopted and I do not know any family medical history.
469,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. That is alright.
470,GENHX,doctor,"So, you are here to review your sleep study results, right?"
470,GENHX,patient,That's right.
470,GENHX,doctor,First let's go back to your medical history a little bit and then we will continue with the result. Patient: Sure.
470,GENHX,doctor,"So, you first came to our Pulmonary Clinic, and you were suffering with dyspnea even on minimal exertion. At that time, we evaluated you and we realized that there was some evidence of irregular sleep and daytime fatigue. At that time you also complained of nighttime choking episodes which got less intense over the past many months."
470,GENHX,patient,That's right. I was then scheduled for the overnight sleep study to be evaluated for interruptions in my sleep and here we are today to discuss results.
470,GENHX,doctor,"Sure. But first tell me, how is your sleeping routine like?"
470,GENHX,patient,It is consistent. I go to bed anytime between nine to ten at night and wake up in the morning around five to six.
470,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to sleep as soon as you go to bed?
470,GENHX,patient,"No, it's hard for me to start that sleeping process and then I'm awake in like every one or two hours throughout the night. I keep on tossing and turning throughout the night. I always find my sheets out of order when I wake up."
470,GENHX,doctor,How would you compare your sleep here in the lab and at your home?
470,GENHX,patient,I would say I slept better in the laboratory than I do at home.
470,GENHX,doctor,How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?
470,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, I feel tired. Sometimes I also have this dull headache."
470,GENHX,doctor,Do you snore?
470,GENHX,patient,"I don't know for myself, but yeah, my daughter was teasing me another day that I was snoring and was talking in my sleep."
470,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever feel that you have difficulty breathing while you are asleep?
470,GENHX,patient,No. But I used to cough a lot in the middle of the night.
470,GENHX,doctor,"You said you used to, so it is not anymore?"
470,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I haven't been coughing for the last few weeks."
470,GENHX,doctor,How's your daily routine? Do you nap in the daytime?
470,GENHX,patient,"I spent a lot of time reading and watching T V. Sometimes I doze off while doing that. Not regular, but I do take nap sometimes in between two to three in afternoon and also in the evening hours."
470,GENHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
470,GENHX,patient,"Oh yes, I take around one to two packs of cigarettes each day mainly after dinner."
470,GENHX,doctor,Have you noticed any change in your weight?
470,GENHX,patient,My weight always keeps fluctuating. I remember I was at my maximum weight of two hundred and sixty pounds around one year ago.
470,GENHX,doctor,If that was your maximum how is your weight now?
470,GENHX,patient,Now it is down by approximately thirty pounds.
470,GENHX,doctor,"So, for your health care, you are coming here in the outpatient psychiatry and also going to your maintenance clinic, right?"
470,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's right."
470,GENHX,doctor,"Your current medications include Methadone, Trazodone, and Seroquel."
470,GENHX,patient,That sounds right.
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, I see you were diagnosed with an acid reflux problem and high blood pressure twenty years back?"
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,And then you also have arthritis and Parkinson's.
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, both."
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Also, you had a brain stroke?"
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, mini stroke!"
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Ah, yes. We also call it as T I A."
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Okay.
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,And currently are you on any medications?
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Just Coumadin, for my chronic A Fib. I have been on it three years."
471,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yeah, atrial fibrillation."
471,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
472,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am."
472,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor."
472,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling today?
472,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, I'm feeling a little bit better."
472,GENHX,doctor,"That's good to hear, ma'am."
473,CC,doctor,"According to the patient, his symptoms started getting progressively worse over the past two days."
473,CC,doctor,No.
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome to the clinic.
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you from the area?
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. I was born and raised in North Carolina. I am the sixth of nine siblings.
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me about you family medical history.
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My family has significant amount of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, autoimmune disease, possible multiple sclerosis, and depression issues."
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is a lot. What is your medical history involving your parents?
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My dad died due to complications of his diabetes.  He passed when he was sixty. My dad was a chef. My mom is doing well. She is ninety three. Both my parents never finished high school. My dad had a third grade education and my mom made it through fourth grade. She was a janitor. She was a smart woman she just never finished her schooling. My parents encouraged me to finish school and to go to college. I got my Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the State University in nineteen seventy nine.
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Did you have any problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems?"
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No. I mostly got A's and B's.  My strongest subject was math, but my worst subject was spelling. My grades were still quite good in spelling, but I had to work hard at it."
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was married for two years. We had two children together. They are forty three and thirty now. My son is the youngest, lives nearby and calls me or stops by every day. My daughter calls me often but she lives in New York. We are close. Their dad, my exhusband passed away in nineteen eighty. He was an alcoholic. His pancreas had enough and shut down."
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry.
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,He did it to himself.
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you working in health care with your nursing degree?
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I worked for Hospital Center for four years. Prior to that, I worked for an outpatient mental health center. I was there for about two and a years. I was fired or laid off I guess? I was not sure why they let me go. I was given no explanation. And before that, I worked for Walter P. Carter Center for twenty one years. I also worked as an O B nurse.  Other than the two instances, I had never been fired or let go from a job."
474,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do in your spare time now?
474,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I enjoy reading, doing puzzles, playing computer games. I joined a women's support group for women my age. I keep myself, busy."
475,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young man."
475,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
475,GENHX,doctor,"How old are you, sir?"
475,GENHX,patient,I'm thirteen.
475,GENHX,doctor,"So, what brings you in today?"
475,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I see that from the report."
475,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, we should do surgery on this knee. There's gross instability of the fragment, and we don't want that get worse."
475,GENHX,doctor,"It's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation of the limb, changes in motion, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, the possible need for another procedure, and possible early arthritis. I would not worry, though. These things are rare."
475,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, he won't feel a thing."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young lady."
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Let's get the personal questions out of the way to begin, shall we?"
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Sure.
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you had any S T D s recently?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, not that I know of."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you sexually active?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I'm not."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'm looking here, and your last P P D was negative, but we'll do another one today."
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Okay, that's fine, doctor."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you been compliant with all of the medicine you've been prescribed?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I've taken everything exactly as you told me to."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, do you remember when your last dentist appointment was?"
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, it was in November of two thousand seven."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What did they do for you at your last visit?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,They pulled two teeth for me.
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, and when was your last pap smear?"
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,It was about a year ago.
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I assume it was negative?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, thankfully."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you had a mammogram yet?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, not yet. I'm not old enough."
476,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have a family history of breast cancer?
476,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't, at least not that I know of."
477,EXAM,doctor,"Hi, I would like to physically examine your rectal area, ok?"
477,EXAM,patient,"No, I am not comfortable with that. I don't want you to do that."
478,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, what brings you here today?"
478,GENHX,patient,I fell four times on third of this month because my leg suddenly gave out.
478,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
478,GENHX,patient,You don't ask age of a lady. She will never tell you the truth.
478,GENHX,doctor,I know I'm in the wrong profession. I have to do that every time I meet someone. So how old are you?
478,GENHX,patient,That's true. I'm just teasing you. I'm fifty one.
478,GENHX,doctor,Are you right handed or left handed?
478,GENHX,patient,I am right handed.
478,GENHX,doctor,"So, you said that your legs suddenly gave out. What happened exactly? Was it sudden? Or were you noticing some weakness before as well?"
478,GENHX,patient,"Oh, I noticed weakness in my right leg before as well and sometimes, like, I have to give the support of my arm to actually move it. Sometimes during these episodes I just turn pale and it's like overall weakness. I feel so tired. My husband, he gives me some sugar, three teaspoons, and then it helps a little bit but not completely."
478,GENHX,doctor,"So, is your weakness like overall in your legs or it is at any single point?"
478,GENHX,patient,"It's overall. I remember in one of these episodes I was, like, in an odd fisted posture."
478,GENHX,doctor,"Is there any change in your sensations? Like if I touch you, is it like same before or was there any change?"
478,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that."
478,GENHX,doctor,Is there change in vision? Are you seeing double?
478,GENHX,patient,Nope.
478,GENHX,doctor,Any difficulty in swallowing or eating? Any loss of consciousness?
478,GENHX,patient,Nope.
478,GENHX,doctor,"Any difficulty in speech? Slurring, or anything like that?"
478,GENHX,patient,No.
478,GENHX,doctor,"You said that these episodes have been happening for some time, so did you see anyone for those before?"
478,GENHX,patient,"Nope. It's just that I fall and then fell again last night. I was feeling so weak. Nothing was helping me. That's when, in the morning, my husband brought me to the U I H C hospital for the evaluation on the fifth."
479,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any medical traits in the family?
479,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Oh yeah. Diabetes and high blood pressure runs in my family.
479,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anything else?
479,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, my mom suffered with a stroke when she was in her seventies."
480,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, ma'am?"
480,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I'm divorced."
480,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you live alone?
480,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, so I have no support at home, it's difficult."
480,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink or smoke?
480,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I never have."
480,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about more illicit substances?
480,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, absolutely not."
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What is your family medical history, sir?"
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,We have some heart issues in my family. My sister died during heart surgery two years ago.
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry.
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. My mom died of a heart attack.
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How old was she when she passed?
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,She was in her seventies? My dad died from a brain hemorrhage. He was only forty nine.
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Your family had been through a lot of loss.
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, we have."
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any siblings that are still living?
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have another sister. Oh yeah. She is a diabetic.
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have kids?
481,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have daughter. The only health problem she has is high cholesterol."
481,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of anyone else in the family with neurological disorders?

484,GENHX,patient,"I'm thirty nine, doctor."
484,GENHX,doctor,"Great, and what seems to be the problem today?"
484,GENHX,patient,I've had this bunion for a good few months now.
484,GENHX,doctor,Is the pain getting worse?
484,GENHX,patient,"Absolutely, I can't take it anymore."
484,GENHX,doctor,How have you managed this bunion so far?
484,GENHX,patient,"I got some wider shoes, and it's done absolutely nothing."
484,GENHX,doctor,I see.
484,GENHX,patient,Is there surgery or something we can do? I can't take the pain.
485,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
485,GENHX,patient,I'm twenty eight.
485,GENHX,doctor,"So, you are here for the dietary consultation. Is this your first pregnancy?"
485,GENHX,patient,"No, this is my second pregnancy. I had gestational diabetes with my first one as well."
485,GENHX,doctor,Were you taking any insulin at that time?
485,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I used insulin last time as well. I'm just here to understand if diet can help me with my gestational diabetes."
485,GENHX,doctor,Sure.
485,GENHX,patient,"My Gynecologist was saying something about ketones, I don't know what they are. She asked me to talk about them with you."
485,GENHX,doctor,"Sure, I will explain everything to you. We also have a pamphlet to explain it. Here have a look. You can take it with you."
485,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
485,GENHX,doctor,Are you exercising?
485,GENHX,patient,I walk everyday with my daughter. I go to drop her to school and then back home.
485,GENHX,doctor,How long is the walk to school?
485,GENHX,patient,"It takes around twenty minutes on one side. So, everyday it is like forty minutes in the morning and same in the evening around four."
485,GENHX,doctor,Do you drink milk?
485,GENHX,patient,"I try to, I know it is a good source of calcium and is very essential especially with my pregnancy, but I am not a big fan of drinking milk."
486,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of any family history of kyphosis?
486,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm sorry, what's that?"
486,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,It has to do with rounding of the spine. Does anyone in your family have a rounded posture?
486,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Actually, yeah, my great grandmother had that, and my mom would talk about my second cousin, he had it too."
487,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,When did you retire from your job?
487,FAM/SOCHX,patient,About eleven years ago. It's definitely been nice. I'm able to spend more time with my grandkids.
487,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Aw, how many grandkids do you have? And do you live alone?"
487,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have four grandkids between the ages of two and eleven. I live in the county with my wife and dog. My wife and I've been together for thirty some years now.
487,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's so wonderful to hear.
488,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young lady."
488,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
488,GENHX,doctor,"How has your weight been since your last visit, with the phentermine?"
488,GENHX,patient,"Well, since the last visit I've gained about a pound."
488,GENHX,doctor,"Well, it could be worse, but we're at a plateau, I'd like to see you lose some more per month."
488,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I've been working really hard, but I haven't been able to get the weight down any further so far."
488,GENHX,doctor,What has been your lowest weight?
488,GENHX,patient,"My lowest? That was one hundred thirty six. I'm just as frustrated as you are, doctor."
488,GENHX,doctor,"Well, if this plateau continues, we should discontinue the phentermine."
488,GENHX,patient,Why is that?
488,GENHX,doctor,"It shouldn't be used to maintain your weight, but only to get the weight down. So, if it's not serving that purpose, we shouldn't use it. There's no real benefit there."
488,GENHX,patient,"Okay, yes, I agree."
489,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anyone in the family had a stroke?
489,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, no one had a stroke in my family."
489,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about someone in the family with heart disease?
489,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No one that I can remember.
489,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"You know doctor, I was born in Munich, Germany."
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, I cannot tell, you speak English so well, no German accent."
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I always knew how to speak English even before I was a teen. So, when I moved to America I did not have any language problem."
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay and did you move with your family?
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, my family moved to the eastern side of the Germany which was occupied by Russia at that time, but I decided to move to America in nineteen fifty seven."
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I had a high school degree from Germany, and I could speak German and English fluently."
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"As soon as I landed here in America, I started working. I started as a secretary at a private firm and later did clerical work at I B M. Now I am retired for almost twenty years due to my cancer complications."
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Your Mesothelioma?
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah.
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, and who all are there in your family?"
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well currently I am alone without any companion. I am divorced. I have a son who lives in Santa Cruz he has grand children, but I have not seen them, I am trying to get in touch with them. I want to see my grandkids."
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Other than him I have a brother and a sister both are healthy and living their life we don't talk much.
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And do you drink or smoke?
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hm, nothing significant."
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any funny drugs like heroine or coke?
490,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
490,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
491,GENHX,doctor,What brings you in today? Can you also please state your age?
491,GENHX,patient,Yeah. I am forty five. I've had really bad stomach pain on my right side since last week.
491,GENHX,doctor,"On a scale of one to ten, how bad is the pain at its worst?"
491,GENHX,patient,I'd have to say a seven.
491,GENHX,doctor,How would you rate it now?
491,GENHX,patient,Oh um it's at a five at the moment.
491,GENHX,doctor,Have you been taking your diabetes medication?
491,GENHX,patient,Micronase?
491,GENHX,doctor,Yes.
491,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I've been taking it every day."
491,GENHX,doctor,"Great. Okay, let's try to get to the bottom of this stomach pain."
492,GENHX,doctor,Your cholesterol appears to be elevated today. Is this the first time you've been told that your cholesterol levels are high?
492,GENHX,patient,"No, unfortunately. I suffer from a few medical problems so maybe that's to blame."
492,GENHX,doctor,I see here that you have diabetes and high blood pressure.
492,GENHX,patient,Right.
492,GENHX,doctor,Does diabetes or high blood pressure run-
492,GENHX,patient,"In the family? No, but heart disease does."
493,GENHX,doctor,How was the sleep study?
493,GENHX,patient,Not bad. Although I hafta admit it was difficult staying up in preparation for it.
493,GENHX,doctor,I can imagine. That's always tough. It looks like the eval of your daytime fatigue and insomnia was sent over. Let me print out a copy and we can go over it together. How old are you again?
493,GENHX,patient,I am forty eight.
494,CC,doctor,So what brings you in today?
494,CC,patient,Ugh.
494,CC,doctor,I'm guessing you're not feeling too great.
494,CC,patient,You got that right. I've had a fever on and off for the past few days.
494,CC,doctor,When was the last time you took your temperature?
494,CC,patient,Right before I drove here.
494,CC,doctor,I see. Did the nurse take your temperature when you came in?
494,CC,patient,"Yes, she did."
494,CC,doctor,"Have you been experiencing cold like symptoms, such as cough, nasal congestion, headache, or nausea?"
494,CC,patient,Um no not really.
494,CC,doctor,Have you tried taking any medicine to help with the fever?
494,CC,patient,Yeah. I've taken Tylenol and that's helped a bit.
494,CC,doctor,Have you had recent sick contacts?
494,CC,patient,I don't think so. I live with three other roommates and they seem fine.
495,ROS,doctor,Anything that has been going on?
495,ROS,patient,No. What do you mean?
495,ROS,doctor,I mean anything wrong from head to toe that you would like to add?
495,ROS,patient,No everything is well. No other problems.
495,ROS,doctor,Okay. Good.
496,GYNHX,doctor,How was the procedure?
496,GYNHX,patient,"It was okay. I was nervous to go under the knife at first, but it turned out better than I expected. Do you know others who've gotten hysterectomies that are near my age?"
496,GYNHX,doctor,"I do, actually. It's a pretty common procedure. I'm glad to hear that you didn't experience any complications."
496,GYNHX,patient,Me too.
497,ALLERGY,doctor,Hello and welcome to our dermatology office. What is the reason for your visit?
497,ALLERGY,patient,I have these rashes on my arms.
497,ALLERGY,doctor,Let me take a look. Do you have prior reports about your history?
497,ALLERGY,patient,"Yeah, I do. I gave it to the nurse."
497,ALLERGY,doctor,Let me go get it really quick. I'm reading the report and it looks like your family is positive for atopy.
497,ALLERGY,patient,"Oh, yeah. We all usually get some type of rash."
497,ALLERGY,doctor,I see. Do you know if you have psoriasis?
497,ALLERGY,patient,Uh. What's that's?
497,ALLERGY,doctor,It's a skin disease that usually has scaly patches.
497,ALLERGY,patient,Uhm. I don't think so.
497,ALLERGY,doctor,"Great. Before I prescribe you medicine to treat your eczema, are you allergic to any drugs?"
497,ALLERGY,patient,Not that I know of.
498,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
498,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I will call myself a social drinker. I would admit that I am addicted to caffeine."
498,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much coffee do you consume each day?
498,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I would say three to five cups.
498,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any history of sexually transmitted disease?
498,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
498,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How're your eating habits?
498,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I would say I am a good eater and follow a healthy diet plan.
498,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you exercise?
498,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I walk every day around five miles. Also, I'm very regular in my sprint training."
499,GENHX,doctor,Good afternoon Sir. Do you know how you got here?
499,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I passed out and the paramedics brought me to the hospital."
499,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any recollection of the incidences leading up to your loss of consciousness?
499,GENHX,patient,I think I had a seizure and then I passed out.
499,GENHX,doctor,Prior to the episode did you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
499,GENHX,patient,No.
499,GENHX,doctor,Any feelings of abnormal heart rhythm?
499,GENHX,patient,No.
499,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any history of any cardiac problems?
499,GENHX,patient,No.
499,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling now?
499,GENHX,patient,I feel fine.
499,GENHX,doctor,Do you know how old you are?
499,GENHX,patient,I am sixty nine.
500,GENHX,doctor,Hello Miss Lee how are you?
500,GENHX,patient,"I am okay, my arms are troubling me so much."
500,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, I know it's been a longstanding pain in both your arms."
500,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, and hands too"
500,GENHX,doctor,Can you pinpoint where exactly is the pain?
500,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it's right here in the middle part of arm and my palm."
500,GENHX,doctor,Okay so mostly in the medial part. Tell me do you feel any weakness?
500,GENHX,patient,"No, but I do feel this tingling sensation kind of like numbness in my left hand, and it gets worse at night after doing repetitive work."
500,GENHX,doctor,Are you left handed?
500,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm right handed"
500,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, any neck pain?"
500,GENHX,patient,"Not really, nothing substantial."
500,GENHX,doctor,Can you please tell me your age again?
500,GENHX,patient,I am fifty two.
500,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever have these kind of signs and symptoms in the past?
500,GENHX,patient,Nope!
500,GENHX,doctor,Okay and are you taking anything for pain?
500,GENHX,patient,"Ah yes, I am taking Lyrica."
500,GENHX,doctor,Lyrica okay and is it helping?
500,GENHX,patient,"Yes, somewhat."
500,GENHX,doctor,Any problem in walking or change in how you walk?
500,GENHX,patient,No.
500,GENHX,doctor,And you are having regular bowel movements any changes?
500,GENHX,patient,"Yes, no changes."
500,GENHX,doctor,"How about urine, any burning or difficulty peeing?"
500,GENHX,patient,"No, it's all fine."
500,GENHX,doctor,"Okay good. So, the neurological exam we did earlier, I have the results for it."
500,GENHX,patient,And?
500,GENHX,doctor,"Well, you were tested positive for Phalen's test on your left hand."
500,GENHX,patient,What does that means?
500,GENHX,doctor,"It means that you have something called Carpal tunnel syndrome, which explains your numbness and tingling sensation in your left hand. It also explains your pain in the middle part of your hand as it's caused due to pinching or compression of a nerve called median nerve."
500,GENHX,patient,"Oh, how did that happen?"
500,GENHX,doctor,"Well, it's possible that your repetitive hand motion could have caused it or sometimes it's just the anatomy of your wrist."
500,GENHX,patient,"Oh, that explains my increased pain in the night after work."
500,GENHX,doctor,Yeah.
500,GENHX,patient,Anything else came in the neuro test?
500,GENHX,doctor,"No, rest of your neurological exam was normal."
500,GENHX,patient,Okay. I am worried now.
500,GENHX,doctor,Don't worry we are here.
500,GENHX,patient,Thank you!
501,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have we gone over your survey results from your last visit?
501,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, do you have those results with you right now?"
501,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yes, I do, they show that you have anxiety disorder."
501,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"That makes sense, thank you for sharing that with me."
502,CC,doctor,I see here that you've been having some chest pain. Where along the chest?
502,CC,patient,It's mostly on the left side.
502,CC,doctor,When did it start?
502,CC,patient,Um a few days ago.
502,CC,doctor,How'd you describe the pain?
502,CC,patient,Kinda dull.
502,CC,doctor,"Any other symptoms with the pain, such as shortness of breath?"
502,CC,patient,"Not really, no."
502,CC,doctor,How long does the pain usually last?
502,CC,patient,For a few minutes. It comes and goes.
502,CC,doctor,Have you taken anything for the pain?
502,CC,patient,"I've taken some Advil, but it doesn't seem to help."
502,CC,doctor,Have you had similar pain in the past?
502,CC,patient,"No, I don't think so."
502,CC,doctor,"And you had surgery on your abdomen five days ago, correct?"
502,CC,patient,Yes. Do you think the pain is related?
502,CC,doctor,I'd like to run some tests and get you in for a CAT scan to see what's going on.
503,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"It looks like he has a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and Afib."
503,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Not according to his chart. I'll see if I can call his emergency contact to confirm.
504,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
504,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I do not smoke or drink alcohol."
504,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about drugs?
504,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope, I have never."
504,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Who do you live with?
504,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Just my family.
505,GENHX,doctor,How old are you now?
505,GENHX,patient,I am sixty five. My kids just through me a surprise birthday party last week.
505,GENHX,doctor,Oh wow! That is so nice. Happy belated birthday.
505,GENHX,patient,It was nice.
505,GENHX,doctor,It looks like you are here today for a recheck for the prostatitis.
505,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
505,GENHX,doctor,I see you have been followed by Doctor Mathis.
505,GENHX,patient,Yes.
505,GENHX,doctor,How often do you see him?
505,GENHX,patient,He has me coming in about every three or four months.
505,GENHX,doctor,Excellent. And the last time I saw you was in May two thousand and four.
505,GENHX,patient,Has it been that long?
505,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, it has. Okay. You are here to discuss some libido problems?"
505,GENHX,patient,"Sadly, yes."
505,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been having these difficulties?
505,GENHX,patient,I noticed the change when I started taking the Proscar.
505,GENHX,doctor,That is a common side effect that some men experience from Proscar. Have you tried any medication to help bring back your libido?
505,GENHX,patient,I take Viagra sometimes.
505,GENHX,doctor,Does it help at all?
505,GENHX,patient,There is some improvement.
505,GENHX,doctor,How many times a night do you get up to relive yourself now?
505,GENHX,patient,I still get up about three to four times.
505,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so still often."
505,GENHX,patient,"Yes, but I have not had any U T Is since I have been on the Proscar."
505,GENHX,doctor,That is good news.
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, sir?"
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I am, Doctor:"
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is this your only marriage?
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, no. I've been married three times now."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"If you don't mind my asking, how long was your longest marriage?"
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I don't mind at all, my longest was two years."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have any children, sir?"
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have two."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How old are they, sir?"
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"They're both fifteen, they're twins, obviously. They're my wife's dependents, though."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, thank you. Did you go to college, sir?"
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I have my bachelor's. I got the military to pay for it."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How long were you in the military?
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I did six years, sir. I was honorably discharged."
506,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Where are you working currently.
506,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I've worked at Purdy Correctional Institute, you know, the one in Gig Harbor? I've worked there for nineteen years."
507,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"So, looks like you have stones in your C B D. I am not hundred percent sure but most likely its stones."
507,ASSESSMENT,patient,C B D?
507,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yeah, short for common bile duct. It's a small tube like structure which connects your liver duct and gallbladder."
507,ASSESSMENT,patient,Oh!
507,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yeah, and because of that you have inflammation in your gallbladder."
507,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Oh, I see."
508,CC,doctor,"No, this is his first one."
509,GENHX,doctor,"Can you tell me more about your son, please?"
509,GENHX,doctor,How long has he used his walker?
509,GENHX,doctor,How old was he when he started walking?
509,GENHX,doctor,"Good, what seems to be the problem today?"
509,GENHX,doctor,"Can you sit on the table, young man? Yes, I'm bending his legs, we call this the popliteal angle, and both sides flex to only about twenty."
509,GENHX,doctor,He should be able to get to ninety.
509,GENHX,doctor,I think we should do surgery on this leg. How does he walk? Can I see?
509,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, he does not walk with a crouched pattern, but he is toe walking."
509,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I believe he should have surgery on the hamstring, as well."
509,GENHX,doctor,"They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues."
509,GENHX,doctor,"Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. It is worth it because the chances of the risks happening are low."
510,ROS,doctor,Did you ever have any reaction to any medication given? Any known allergies?
510,ROS,patient,No.
510,ROS,doctor,Was there any swelling where your lymphnodes are?
510,ROS,patient,No.
510,ROS,doctor,Was there ever any complaint of abnormal lymph nodes?
510,ROS,patient,No.
511,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have anyone with psychiatric symptoms in the family?
511,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't have family!"
511,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you mean?
511,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mom dad died and I was raised in the Philippines.
511,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Adopted?
511,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No by myself.
511,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wow that must have been tough.
511,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Oh it's a story for another day.
512,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Do you have any chronic conditions I should know about, sir?"
512,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, not that I can think of."
512,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"What about injuries, have you ever broken a bone?"
512,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I have. I've broken my hand and tibia before."
513,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome to the clinic.
513,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
513,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any family history of cancer? Either solid tumors or blood malignancies?
513,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. None that I know of.
514,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Can you tell me what surgeries have you had in the past?
514,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I have had appendix surgery when I was twenty one years old and eight years back I had C Section.
514,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay. I want to know how many pregnancies you had and how many babies?
514,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Sure, I have only two."
514,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay. Do you have any issues with your periods?
514,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I get heavy periods because of fibroids in my uterus."
514,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Oh. When was your last menstrual period?
514,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh, you can say about three weeks back."
514,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay. Good.
515,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. Before we begin your visit, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please?"
515,GENHX,patient,"I'm forty nine years old, and I identify as white."
515,GENHX,doctor,Thank you. What brought you in today?
515,GENHX,patient,I was referred to you so that I could get whatever's wrong with me under control.
515,GENHX,doctor,I see. What seems to be happening?
515,GENHX,patient,I hurt the back of my leg pretty bad this past year when I was in A B C D.
515,GENHX,doctor,What part of your leg?
515,GENHX,patient,The back of my left thigh.
515,GENHX,doctor,I see. So just the leg?
515,GENHX,patient,I also hurt my kneecap from a boat when I was out in the water fishing.
515,GENHX,doctor,Was that severe?
515,GENHX,patient,"It was a whole show. A helicopter came down and swooped me to X Y Z Hospital, where I got surgery."
515,GENHX,doctor,I can see you still have an external fixation on your knee so that the fracture heals. Did the hospital give you a report on the surgery?
515,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, they did. Here you go."
515,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Let me take a look. So, it looks like you underwent grafting and full thickness skin grafting for closure for a large defect in your left posterior thigh. That seems to be healed in the gluteal fold on the left area."
515,GENHX,patient,Yeah. Whatever that means.
515,GENHX,doctor,Let me examine the area.
515,GENHX,patient,Go for it.
515,GENHX,doctor,I can see several areas that have hypergranulation tissues around the graft site and low in the leg.
515,GENHX,patient,Is that bad?
515,GENHX,doctor,I don't think so. Are you feeling any symptoms of a fever or anything?
515,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm not."
515,GENHX,doctor,That's good. You don't have any infections then.
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And are you working?
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Ah yes, I am a painter."
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay good.
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I do."
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hm and how much do you smoke?
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, about two packs a day."
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And how about alcohol, do you drink?"
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No sir, I don't drink."
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any drugs?
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,You mean like cocaine and stuff?
516,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Yeah.
516,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, no drugs."
517,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome to the clinic, ma'am. I am Doctor Smith."
517,GENHX,patient,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
517,GENHX,doctor,"Doctor X referred you to us, is that correct?"
517,GENHX,patient,Yes. He is my primary care doctor.
517,GENHX,doctor,It looks like you have a birthday coming up. Happy early birthday!
517,GENHX,patient,"Thank you. Yes, I am going to be seventy seven."
517,GENHX,doctor,Doctor Kim's notes said that you have had pain in the left flank pain. Can you tell me more about the pain?
517,GENHX,patient,"Yes. The pain started four or five days ago. It has been in my stomach and through to my back, on the left side. Right here."
517,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Have you had any nausea or vomiting?
517,GENHX,patient,"Yes. I had some nausea, and I threw up a few times."
517,GENHX,doctor,"Have you noticed any blood, pain and or burning during urination?"
517,GENHX,patient,No.
517,GENHX,doctor,Any fever or chills?
517,GENHX,patient,No.
517,GENHX,doctor,I have the ultrasound results that Doctor X ordered the other day.  The ultrasound found a stone in your left ureteral. The stone is about one point three C M in size.
517,GENHX,patient,Is there some thing we can do to remove it? I really want this taken care of.
517,GENHX,doctor,Yes. Let us go over the treatment options.
518,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am. You're forty one years old, correct?"
518,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, have you followed up with Doctor X since your surgery?"
518,GENHX,patient,Why would I do that?
518,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, just because she referred you to me."
518,GENHX,patient,"Oh, no, I haven't yet."
518,GENHX,doctor,That's fine. Have you heard the details behind your surgery?
518,GENHX,patient,"I heard it once, but I can't remember anything. Can you remind me?"
518,GENHX,doctor,"Well, you had a complicated case, but we did an anterior cervical discectomy, two level corpectomy, with a spinal decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in your large cervical plate."
518,GENHX,patient,"Oh, that's a lot, doctor."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, how are you doing today?"
518,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've felt good for the last two days."
518,GENHX,doctor,Have you been able to move your arms and legs for the last few days?
518,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I can actually move all four."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Good, are you having any issues breathing?"
518,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing of note there."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, today, I think you'd be a good candidate for a halo vest placement."
518,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, doctor, I'm not going back to the O R."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, we can do it here."
518,GENHX,patient,"Okay doctor, I'd like to do it here."
518,GENHX,doctor,"Let me get A B C to help me with this. Also, we're going to move you to S I C U room one."
518,GENHX,patient,Can you tell me the details about what you're going to do?
518,GENHX,doctor,"Well, this is a P M T halo, I like this one better than the Bremer halo vest, and I'll use morphine and Versed."
518,GENHX,patient,Are you going to use anesthesia?
518,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I have local anesthetic, it's xylocaine and epinephrine, um, it's somewhere between fifteen and twenty C C."
519,CC,doctor,Is everything fine?
519,CC,doctor,When did this start?
519,CC,doctor,"Okay let's see what we can do, how old is she?"
519,CC,doctor,"Okay. Don't worry, we will see what we can do."
519,CC,doctor,Of Course.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Welcome in, sir."
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let us start off with a little background.
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your current living status? Do you live with others or on your own?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, right now I am living with my sister in Sacaton. I am currently looking for my own place, but I am staying with her for now."
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you looking for a place in Sacaton?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. I will probably look for a place back in Coolidge.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Back in Coolidge? Have you lived there before?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I recently separated from my wife. We lived in Coolidge together. Sacaton is too far away from everything, but it is fine for now."
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry to hear that.
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. My sister has been a saint. I am not working right now so my sister is letting me stay with her for free. She gave up her home office and made me a nice room to stay in.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Your sister is very generous. Are you and your sister close?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Not when we were growing up but now that we are older, we have become very close. She has been a great support for me in these hard times."
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's wonderful. Are you a tobacco user?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I smoke cigarettes. I only smoke a little bit.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you smoke per day?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I only smoke about one or two cigarettes a day.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you or have you ever used drugs or alcohol?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have never used drugs. I used to be a heavy drinker. I quit drinking a year ago.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's great. Do you attend A A meetings?
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, but I might start. Things have been very stressful lately with the separation and being on unemployment."
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I think it could be beneficial to you.
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay.
520,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I have a list for different support groups in the area that I can give you.
520,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Great. Thank you.
521,EDCOURSE,doctor,"How are you feeling after that insulin drip, Miss A B C?"
521,EDCOURSE,patient,I am feeling much better. My sugar levels are normal.
521,EDCOURSE,doctor,"Yes, between one hundred fifteen and one thirty four. So, on the second day after your admission they did laparoscopic removal of your gallstones. You were very difficult to intubate. But everything went well with surgery. There was some swelling and adhesions around your gallbladder, but all is well that ends well."
521,EDCOURSE,patient,What was my blood sugar during surgery?

522,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. My nurse says that you are forty one years old, and you identify as a White female, is that correct?"
522,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's all correct."
522,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so, what seems to be the trouble today?"
522,GENHX,patient,"Well, I'm having some pain in this foot, it's right over this bone."
522,GENHX,doctor,Is your pain right here?
522,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it really hurts right there."
522,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, this is known as your navicular bone. What makes the pain worse?"

522,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any past history of problems with this foot?
522,GENHX,patient,"Well, I have a history of multiple osteochondromas."
522,GENHX,doctor,Do they know what caused these?
522,GENHX,patient,"No, no one ever figured it out, they just said it was hereditary."
522,GENHX,doctor,Have they done surgery on these in the past?
522,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had a surgery for this a while ago."
522,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had this problem in your feet or spine?
522,GENHX,patient,"No, this is new. Can we do that surgery again? I can't take this pain."
523,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,On April twenty two four we went over your list of medication and allergies.

525,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does your family have any health related problems?
525,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, we do. We have a strong history of heart disease. I think it could be because we drink a lot."
525,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, would you say alcoholism runs in your family?"
525,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. We drink a lot every day. Beer, liquor, you name it."
526,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you working these days?
526,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, sir. I've been retired for a couple years now."
526,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Congratulations. I hope you're enjoying your time off.
526,FAM/SOCHX,patient,You bet.
526,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You mentioned having a smoking history. When did you quit and approximately how much did you smoke?
526,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Uh I quit about twenty seven years ago. If I had to guess, I smoked about two packs a day."
526,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you smoke only cigarettes?
526,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Cigars, too."
526,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about alcohol?
526,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hardly ever.

527,GENHX,patient,"Well, I have this, um, mass of my left foot, it's been getting worse too."
527,GENHX,doctor,I see it. How long has this tissue mass been there on that foot?
527,GENHX,patient,"It's been about two weeks now, but it's getting worse way faster now."
527,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any history of cancer?
527,GENHX,patient,"No, but I've had an, um, shave biopsy in the past."
527,GENHX,doctor,I see.
527,GENHX,patient,Is there any surgery we can do for this to cut it off? I really want it gone.
528,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for a living?
528,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Actually, I'm retired now, but I was an engineer, and I did some real estate brokering as well on the side."
528,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, that's a lot. Congratulations on your retirement!"
528,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you, now I get to spend more time with my wife."
528,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wonderful, do you have any children?"

536,GENHX,doctor,Are you feeling okay right now or are you experiencing symptoms?

536,GENHX,patient,"I do have some left shoulder pain. Not so much painful, but it is uncomfortable and tender."
536,GENHX,doctor,Have you measured your blood sugar at all? I ask because the notes state there is a history of gestational diabetes and when blood sugars are out of the normal limits this can cause some of the symptoms you are having.
536,GENHX,patient,I measured it today. After lunch it was one fifty five.
537,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does anyone in your family have or have history of any colon cancer or unusual polyps?

542,GENHX,doctor,How're you today?
542,GENHX,patient,Not too bad. I'm hanging in there. My asthma has been acting up.
542,GENHX,doctor,Oh no. How long has this been going on?
542,GENHX,patient,For the past three months. I've been using my inhaler every day. I used to use it every now and again. This is definitely new for me.
542,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing any allergies alongside your asthma?
542,GENHX,patient,"Yes, actually. My husband has been hauling a lot more corn this season and it seems to be making my allergies much worse."
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you take anything for your allergies?
542,GENHX,patient,"Not really. I'll sometimes take Allegra and that seems to help just a tiny bit. I was previously prescribed Flonase, but I can't remember the last time I took it. Oh and I was on Advair, too."
542,GENHX,doctor,Did the Flonase or Advair help at all?
542,GENHX,patient,I had to stop Advair because it started to bother my lady parts.
542,GENHX,doctor,How so?
542,GENHX,patient,I noticed that it became more itchy as a result.
542,GENHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that.
542,GENHX,patient,"Speaking of this, I wanted to also share that I've been experiencing a lot of P M S symptoms lately. I'm super impatient and moody."
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you notice these symptoms are still there after you finish your cycle?
542,GENHX,patient,Um lemme think. The symptoms start about a week before my period and tend to get less intense once I get over the first day of bleeding.
542,GENHX,doctor,Are your cycles generally regular?
542,GENHX,patient,"For the most part, yes. I feel like they don't last as long as they used to. I'm not sure why. I do, however, notice some spotting after my cycles end."
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you get any night sweats or hot flashes while you're on your period?
542,GENHX,patient,No.
542,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any other medical troubles recently?
542,GENHX,patient,I did have a U T I and some blood in my urine because of it.
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember how many times you noticed blood in your urine?
542,GENHX,patient,Hm about three times. I was prescribed antibiotics for it.
542,GENHX,doctor,"Have you had any other urinary symptoms since? How about bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or anything of the like?"
542,GENHX,patient,Nothing now.
542,GENHX,doctor,Have you gotten your urine rechecked recently?
542,GENHX,patient,"No, not yet. I really should get it checked out again."
542,GENHX,doctor,I can write an order for you if you'd like or you can make an appointment with your urologist. Do you have a specific urologist that you see?
542,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I can call to make the appointment tomorrow. Do I also need to get blood work done?"
542,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, in fact I'd like to order some blood work while you're here."
542,GENHX,patient,"I had blood work done a few days ago for my life insurance application. I am forty two so thought I should get that going. My Swedish mother always used to nag about how I procrastinate on important things. Anyways, do I still need to get more blood work done?"
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you know what they checked?
542,GENHX,patient,I think the typical blood work with cholesterol added.
542,GENHX,doctor,Do you happen to have a copy on hand or could you fax me the resulxts?
542,GENHX,patient,I can fax them to you once I get them back.
542,GENHX,doctor,That would be great. Thank you. Let me write down our fax number for you.
543,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Okay, so your psych evaluation came out unremarkable. Do you have any other problems?"
543,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I have this acne. I hate it. I am not feeling comfortable in my own skin.
544,GENHX,doctor,"Hello there, how are you?"
544,GENHX,doctor,"I understand, so how old is she?"

544,GENHX,doctor,When did you first notice it?
544,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and how many times till now?"
544,GENHX,doctor,Did you notice any interrupted breathing or bluish color around her mouth?
544,GENHX,doctor,While the episode occurs do you notice any color changes in the baby?
544,GENHX,doctor,Did you happened to notice any arching of the back or eyes rolling back?
544,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. Otherwise, is she feeding well and is active?"

550,GENHX,doctor,Then why didn't you go and visit your regular dentist?
550,GENHX,patient,I would have but I have missed so many appointments that they now do not allow me to schedule regular appointments. So they put me on a standby appointment now.

567,GENHX,patient,"Well, it was on January seventeenth. I had these episodes where I was like always so confused and looks like I lost everything. All my memory and everything. And then they did a scan. It was verified that I was having a stroke on the same day."
567,GENHX,doctor,Did they put you on some medications?
567,GENHX,patient,They gave me an anticonvulsant and aspirin.
567,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking them regularly?
567,GENHX,patient,"There have a few times like one or two days that I forgot to take my, uh, dyphenhydramine, but even when I'm taking it regularly, I'm still having all those symptoms or forgetfulness, confusion, and everything."
567,GENHX,doctor,"Do you feel anything else along with these episodes like a urine urgency, tendency to bite your tongue, headaches, any visual change, or your heart is beating very fast? Any kind of weakness or numbness or shortness of breath?"

569,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I told you I have a lot going on."
569,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you taking any medications?
569,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, they wanted me to take Coumadin but I had, um, a subdural hematoma so they would let me."
569,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"I see, what about any neurological or psychological conditions?"
569,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, I have depression, and I've had panic attacks while taking Doxepin before."
569,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"I see here that you also have perioperative anemia, does that sound familiar?"
569,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, another doctor told me about that."
569,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any other symptoms you'd like to report today?
569,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um, I'm having some difficulty swallowing."
570,EXAM,doctor,"Doctor Shami, can you please take down the notes as I examine the patient?"
570,EXAM,doctor,Can you put the heading as cervical lymph nodes.
570,EXAM,doctor,I am going to check for any swelling in your neck okay? Can you look down?
570,EXAM,patient,Okay.
570,EXAM,doctor,"Alright, I do not feel anything here. Can you look up?"
570,EXAM,patient,Sure.
570,EXAM,doctor,No palpable nodes here. None of the lymph nodes are enlarged or have any swellings.
570,EXAM,doctor,Yeah.
571,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,You have chronic pain?
571,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Yes I do.
571,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,You use tobacco also?
571,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Yes.
571,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"And you have a history of hepatitis C, right?"
571,DIAGNOSIS,patient,That sounds right.
571,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Okay.
571,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Yeah.
572,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
572,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, none."

573,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, are you working right now?"

574,GENHX,doctor,"How are you, Mary?"
574,GENHX,patient,"I am okay, I have got this ulcer on my right hip again."
574,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, is it like the one you got last time?"
574,GENHX,patient,Pretty much.
574,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I remember that one. It took almost three treatment cycles to get resolved."
574,GENHX,patient,Yeah. They keep saying I have some hidden split in my spine still.
574,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, it looks like you have residual spina bifida."
574,GENHX,patient,I am just so frustrated sitting in my wheelchair. I am spending around sixteen hours a day in this wheelchair.
574,GENHX,doctor,"I think, that is the reason you developed this pressure ulcer. It appears to be on the right trochanter area. In simple terms you have developed a pressure sore on the outer part of your hip."
574,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I recently celebrated my thirtieth birthday just sitting in my wheelchair the whole day."
574,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I am sorry dear. So, how long since you have had this ulcer?"
574,GENHX,patient,"It's been several weeks, so I thought I should get it checked."
574,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, good thing you came. We need to treat it. Did you experience any chills or fever?"
574,GENHX,patient,No.
574,GENHX,doctor,Any other symptoms?
574,GENHX,patient,No.
575,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any history of heart disease that you know of?
575,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Nope, nothing like that."
575,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How about diabetes?
575,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, there's no sugar here that I know of."
575,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good, and how about your lungs? Do they work well."
575,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Absolutely, they're in great shape. There's nothing like that here."
576,ALLERGY,doctor,How about allergies to medications?
576,ALLERGY,patient,Nope.
577,IMAGING,doctor,Your chest x ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema. This means that you have fluid in your lungs. That would explain your chest pain and the difficulies with your breathing. I would like to start you off with a course of antibiotics to prevent any possible infection. I will also send in a prescription for Furosemide. It will reduce the fluid accumulation in your lungs. Do you have any questions?
577,IMAGING,patient,When should I start to feel better?
577,IMAGING,doctor,You should start to feel better within three to five days.
578,ROS,doctor,Any headaches?
578,ROS,patient,No.
578,ROS,doctor,Any history of seizures or epilepsy?
578,ROS,patient,No.
578,ROS,doctor,Any sudden loss of consciousness or have you blacked out?
578,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
578,ROS,doctor,Any weakness? Feeling any tremors in your body?
578,ROS,patient,"No, nothing like that."
578,ROS,doctor,Any history of stroke or any brain related condition?
578,ROS,patient,"No, no such history."
579,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are there any known disease running in your family?
579,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My dad has high blood pressure, and he takes medication for it. He is now eighty two years old. He had a stroke around two years ago. This was his second stroke. First one he had when he was forty five."
579,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your mom? How old is she?
579,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mom is eighty years old. She does have sugar issues.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you currently living alone?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yep. Just me, myself, and I."
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for a living?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I've been working as a plumber for the last five years.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Nice. Where do you work?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Mostly in the city.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you drink, smoke, or do injection drugs?"
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I drink and smoke here and there, but I've never tried hard drugs."
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any recent travel?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I was in Mexico earlier this year.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That sounds nice. How was your trip?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Relaxing. Much needed.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great to hear. I have a few more questions I need to ask so bear with me. How is your sexual history? Are you sexually active?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm sexually active with women, but my sex life isn't as good as it was in Japan. Over there, I would mix and mingle with prostitutes."
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you use protection?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't really remember.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you been tested for S T D's?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yep. I'm negative for right now.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you ever been incarcerated?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
580,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,One last question. Have you ever been in need of a blood transfusion?
580,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, thank God."
581,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, champ, how you holding up?"
581,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, Doctor, I have a lot of lower back pain."
581,GENHX,doctor,"Oh no, before we begin, how old are you, sir and which hand do you write with?"
581,GENHX,patient,I'm seventy five now. Right.
581,GENHX,doctor,"Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain?"
581,GENHX,patient,It's been about ten days now.
581,GENHX,doctor,Have your symptoms improved at all since they began?
581,GENHX,patient,"No, they keep getting worse."
581,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain radiate into your legs?
581,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe."
581,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain?
581,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five."
581,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen another doctor for this pain?
581,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on."
581,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments did he recommend?
581,GENHX,patient,He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way.
581,GENHX,doctor,Did you drive yourself?
581,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I did."
581,GENHX,doctor,How did the antiinflammatories work?
581,GENHX,patient,"Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner."
581,GENHX,doctor,Was there any leg numbness?
581,GENHX,patient,Yes. Since December eleventh.
581,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain?
581,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain."
581,GENHX,doctor,What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do?
581,GENHX,patient,"He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong. He recommended I follow up at U I H C. The imaging was on my L S Spine."
582,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Alright. So this is going to be a complex case. Your wound is complicated by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cellulitis.
582,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Is there a treatment for my right leg?
582,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"There is. It will be more aggressive, but we can do it."
583,CC,doctor,What is going on with him?
584,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, young man. You're a patient of Doctor X Y Z, correct?"
584,GENHX,patient,"Yes sir, that's right. I've seen him for years."
584,GENHX,doctor,"I just need to confirm some demographic information before we get started today. So, you're a twenty nine year old white male, correct?"
584,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor. That's all right."
584,GENHX,doctor,"Great, thank you. So, what seems to be the problem today?"
584,GENHX,patient,"Well, I got stung by a Yellow Jacket Wasp yesterday."
584,GENHX,doctor,Do you have a lot of swelling?
584,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it's in my right hand and right arm."
584,GENHX,doctor,Have you every been stung by wasps before?
584,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, this wouldn't be the first time."
584,GENHX,doctor,Have you had similar reactions before?
584,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I have. I have had one severe reaction. I came because I wanted to make sure it didn't get to that point again. I've never had, um, anaphylaxis, nothing super serious to date."
584,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, that's good. Do you have any shortness of breath or difficulty with your throat?"
584,GENHX,patient,"No, it's never felt like it was going to close up or anything like that."
584,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any rapid heartbeat or anxiety?
584,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't have anything like that either."
584,GENHX,doctor,"So, it's just the localized swelling where you got stung?"
584,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's really all, doctor."
585,GYNHX,doctor,When was your last menstrual period?
585,GYNHX,patient,"Um, it was around June third of two thousand nine."
585,GYNHX,doctor,Okay so it says you have had an abortion recently?
585,GYNHX,patient,"Yes I have, but I am not sure if it is finished, because I am still bleeding."
585,GYNHX,doctor,Okay.
585,GYNHX,patient,Do you want me to do a pregnancy test?
585,GYNHX,doctor,No I would have you see our Gynecology and Obstetrician.
585,GYNHX,patient,Okay.
586,ROS,doctor,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that."
586,ROS,doctor,"Okay I will look at it. But other than that, everything else looks good? Any other problems related to circumcision?"
587,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome to the clinic, Miss A."
587,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
587,GENHX,doctor,Let's start with your medical history. What medical conditions do you have?
587,GENHX,patient,"Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer."
587,GENHX,doctor,What kind of cancer do you have?
587,GENHX,patient,I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy.
587,GENHX,doctor,Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting?
587,GENHX,patient,Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke.
587,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any other surgeries?
587,GENHX,patient,Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.
587,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling today?
587,GENHX,patient,"I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier."
587,GENHX,doctor,Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue?
587,GENHX,patient,No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once.
587,GENHX,doctor,This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea?
587,GENHX,patient,Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen.
587,GENHX,doctor,Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night?
587,GENHX,patient,"Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night."
587,GENHX,doctor,How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night?
587,GENHX,patient,"Maybe two to five hours, on a good night."
587,GENHX,doctor,That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea.
587,GENHX,patient,Okay. I will make a follow up visit with her.
588,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,They gave you Procrit for your anemia?
588,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes I think so. That is how they treated it in the past.
588,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay. Are you married? Who do you live with?
588,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Oh I am by myself.
588,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Okay, and do you smoke or drink alcohol?"
588,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No I do not.
588,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Great.
588,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Okay.
589,GENHX,doctor,Hello. How are you doing?
589,GENHX,patient,Not doing that good. I'm here so that you can help me.
589,GENHX,doctor,Tell me how can I do that? What's bothering you?
589,GENHX,patient,"I have gestational diabetes and I'm here for consultation related to my diet. No matter what I eat, I'm kind of scared that it will spike up my numbers."
589,GENHX,doctor,"Hold on, hold on. First, tell me how old are you?"
589,GENHX,patient,Sorry. I am thirty eight.
589,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, now tell me what are you afraid of?"
589,GENHX,patient,"No matter what I eat, my number goes up and I just, I'm so afraid of eating anything now."
589,GENHX,doctor,Do you work?
589,GENHX,patient,"I do, at Walmart. I try not to eat anything whenever I'm on the third shift."
589,GENHX,doctor,"Tell me about the eating habits. Do you prepare meals at home, or do you order from outside?"
589,GENHX,patient,"Well, before all this, I mean this gestational diabetes and pregnancy, I used to eat out a lot. Almost like every day. I like to eat rice a lot. It is like the staple food for me."
589,GENHX,doctor,"You said you don't try to eat, so are you facing any symptoms because of not eating?"
589,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, whenever I'm on my late shift, I work from ten in the night to seven in the morning. I try to avoid eating. And then I feel very fatigued and tired all the time. I also have young kids at home, so after finishing my duty here at in the morning I go home and then there are young children who keep me busy."
589,GENHX,doctor,What is your sleeping pattern? How much are you sleeping throughout the day?
589,GENHX,patient,Around two to four hours at a time.
589,GENHX,doctor,When do you test for ketones?
589,GENHX,patient,"Normally, it is the first thing that I do when I reach back home from my shift in the morning."
590,GENHX,doctor,How old are you? What brings you here today?
590,GENHX,patient,I am fifty six years old. I am here for this pain in my legs. It hurts mostly in the night.
590,GENHX,doctor,Does changing positions helps you?
590,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it helps. Whenever I stand it just goes away."
590,GENHX,doctor,Is it only in your legs or it starts there and goes somewhere else as well?
590,GENHX,patient,It normally starts in my hips and then it goes down my leg and sometimes into my ankles as well.
590,GENHX,doctor,When did you first notice it?
590,GENHX,patient,"It all started after taking that medication. What is it called? Something with L? Yeah, Lipitor."
590,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever noticed any night sweats?
590,GENHX,patient,Sometimes I do sweat at night.
590,GENHX,doctor,Any other issue? Anything else going on? Your body temperature is a little on the higher end.
590,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I do feel feverish and have nausea as well."
590,GENHX,doctor,How are your sugar numbers?
590,GENHX,patient,"They have been low for quite some time. You know, I have started going to Genesis in Wichita and I've been doing water aerobics. And you know what? Surprisingly, I have lost thirty pounds."
590,GENHX,doctor,That's good. How much is your fasting sugar?
590,GENHX,patient,"Anywhere between a hundred to one hundred and twenty. I check them one and a half hours after meals as well. They are, they have been one hundred and eighty five regularly."
590,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
590,GENHX,patient,Yeah. I have a request to make. I will be coming for my diabetic checkup in one month. Can we do all the labs before that?
590,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, sure, that's a great idea. I should tell my assistant and they will call you for labs before your appointment for diabetes checkup."
590,GENHX,doctor,Anything else going on? How is everything else?
590,GENHX,patient,"I tried to control my cholesterol with diet, but it didn't help. I cannot keep on dieting. It is just not my thing. I have started eating more meat though. I feel full after that."
591,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
591,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
591,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have kids?
591,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I do have seven. I have a handful."
591,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you work?

591,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope. None of that.
592,ALLERGY,doctor,Is patient allergic to any medication?
592,ALLERGY,doctor,"Okay, so he is allergic to Lamisil, Equagesic. Oh, he is allergic to Bactrim too."
592,ALLERGY,doctor,"That's quite a lot, we need to be careful while making his treatment plan."
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hi there! I am Doctor Smith.
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hello! It is nice to meet you.
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let's start with your family medical history.
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mother had breast cancer. My father had lung cancer that ended up taking his life. He was seventy nine when he passed. My mother also passed but not from an illness but from an infection she got after having an elective surgery.
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry for your loss. How old was your mother when she passed?
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. She was eighty one when she passed. I am an orphan now. My only living sibling died at forty. He had a hard life. He struggled with mental illness.
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How did your brother pass away?
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"He had pancreatitis. Oh, my dad had glaucoma."
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You have had a lot of loss.
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have. My good friend passed away a year and a half ago. It has been a lot."
593,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I have a support group I can refer you to for people to have been through loss. Would you be interested a referral, sir?"
593,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I would like that. Thank you.
594,GENHX,doctor,"I will ask some simple questions, okay?"
594,GENHX,patient,Hm
594,GENHX,doctor,How old are you and how would you define yourself in terms of ethnicity?
594,GENHX,patient,"Well, I am forty seven and would proudly call myself as Latin American."
594,GENHX,doctor,Great. What brings you to the emergency room?
594,GENHX,patient,I had a blood test before and then it came out to be high potassium. I also went to a regular clinic the other day as I was feeling very weak and extremely tired.
594,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
594,GENHX,patient,"My potassium came out to be seven and it was highlighted in red. That really scared me, so I wanted to know everything what's going on inside me. I told the emergency doctors too that all these weakness and tiredness is going on for more than half a year."
594,GENHX,doctor,Did you noticed any other symptoms other than weakness?
594,GENHX,patient,"Yes, there was the fever and chills. I was sweating a lot in the nights, and I also had weight loss of around twenty pounds. During that time, I sometimes have nausea and was throwing up a lot. I was not eating. I always felt dizzy every time I tried to stand."
594,GENHX,doctor,Did you have wet cough?
594,GENHX,patient,"No, not wet cough but I did notice back pain gets intense on the upper side whenever I coughed, like in my ribs. I normally massage that area and it gets better."
594,GENHX,doctor,Any shortness of breath?
594,GENHX,patient,Nope.
594,GENHX,doctor,How about while sleeping or doing something else?
594,GENHX,patient,"Not while sleeping, but I did notice that if I'm walking for two to three blocks then I get out of breath easily. Previously it was not like this. I used to jog for two to three miles without even a single breath loss."
594,GENHX,patient,I noticed one more thing. I feel like my balls on one side are getting big.
594,GENHX,doctor,Which side left or right?
594,GENHX,patient,I think its left.
594,GENHX,doctor,For how long?
594,GENHX,patient,"I guess over the past year. I did see someone when all of this started, and he put me on some antibiotics, but nothing changed. For last few months there is yellow fluid coming out of it too."
594,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever get any type of injury in the area?
594,GENHX,patient,No.
594,GENHX,doctor,What about your bowel movements?
594,GENHX,patient,Nope everything is as usual.
594,GENHX,doctor,Any change in urinary habits?
594,GENHX,patient,Nope.
594,GENHX,doctor,Any changes in your skin? Any rash? Any kind of eyesight issue?
594,GENHX,patient,"Nope, no changes."
594,GENHX,doctor,What about pain? Like headache or any joint pain?
594,GENHX,patient,"Nope, no pain anywhere."
595,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
595,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, I've had a few. First, I had, um, tubal ligation, and three milk ducts removed."
595,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,What year was that in?
595,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"That was in, um, nineteen seventy nine."
595,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Great, thank you. What else have you had done?"
595,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"I had a breast biopsy in nineteen eighty nine, and a colonoscopy in two thousand seven."
595,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Thank you, do you have any children?"
595,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Well, doctor, I've been pregnant four times, but I've had three children."
595,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you have a C section with any of them?
595,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, doctor. I had a natural birth for all of them."
596,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Did you had any surgery in the past?
596,PASTSURGICAL,patient,No.
597,ALLERGY,doctor,Any allergies?
597,ALLERGY,patient,Yes just molds.
597,ALLERGY,doctor,Okay so molds reaction.
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Hi there, how are you dear?"
598,MEDICATIONS,patient,"I am fine, thank you."
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Nice to meet you. So I see you have been referred by Doctor X.
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Okay, so you noticed some behavioral problems with your daughter and reported to her, is that right?"
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Well, looking at her reports I am afraid it looks like she does have A D H D, but the good news is we can treat her, so don't worry."
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,I am going to prescribe her some medicines which will help her deal with this.
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"So, I will write her a prescription for Adderall and Clonidine. They have some really good results in treating A D H D. Which pharmacy do you go to?"
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Okay, I will send it there."
598,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Thank you doctor, it was nice meeting you."
598,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"Nice meeting you too, take care."
599,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,He had circumcision?
599,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yes.
599,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you remember the date?
599,PASTSURGICAL,patient,No I do not. But it should be in the chart.
600,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir. You're sixty one years old, correct?"
600,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct."
600,GENHX,doctor,"Great, and you identify as Caucasian, right?"
600,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct as well."
600,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, do you have any medical conditions that I should know about?"
600,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have diabetes."
600,GENHX,doctor,How are you handling your diabetes?
600,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've had diabetes for a long time but had never been treated for it."
600,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, thank you for telling me. What seems to be the problem today?"
600,GENHX,patient,"I've been working in my garage over the past few days, and I have this redness and swelling in my right foot."
600,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any itchiness or pain?
600,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and it's getting worse."
600,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen any other doctors about this?
600,GENHX,patient,"Um, yes. I went to the A B C D General Hospital E R and they gave me an evaluation there."
600,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any images from this visit?
600,GENHX,patient,"Um, yes. I have them right here."
600,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, these show a foreign body in the foot."
600,GENHX,patient,But what about all the stuff on the outside of my foot?
600,GENHX,doctor,"Well, that's consistent with cellulitis."
600,GENHX,patient,What's that?
600,GENHX,doctor,It's a skin infection we clean it up in surgery.
600,GENHX,patient,What kind of procedure can we do?
600,GENHX,doctor,"We should do an irrigation debridement for the cellulitis, and remove the foreign body. I think that will really help."
600,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I agree, doctor."
601,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. How are you doing today?"
601,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm flustered. I brought my wife so she can speak for me.
601,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. What seems to be the problem with your husband?"
602,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, ma'am?"
602,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, to my wonderful husband."
602,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does he help you out around the house?
602,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, he is just wonderful."
602,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you drink or smoke?"
602,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't do any of that."
602,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How about more illicit substances, do you use any of that?"
602,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, absolutely not."
603,ROS,doctor,Anything else going on from head to toe?
603,ROS,patient,"No doctor, everything else is fine."
603,ROS,doctor,Are you sure?
603,ROS,patient,Yes I am sure.
604,DISPOSITION,doctor,He's doing much better. He'll be going home today with a prescription for Zithromax.
604,DISPOSITION,doctor,"However, I'd like to still see him in the office next week for a reevaluation."
604,DISPOSITION,doctor,"Yes, the front desk will be able to help you with that."
605,ROS,doctor,How long have you been running a fever?
605,ROS,patient,It's been on and off for a few days now. I'm also having chills.
605,ROS,doctor,Have you taken anything for the fever?
605,ROS,patient,Tylenol and Advil. I've been taking them interchangeably.
605,ROS,doctor,When was the last time you took your temperature?
605,ROS,patient,An hour ago. The thermometer read one O one point four.
605,ROS,doctor,"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or others?"
605,ROS,patient,I've been having a stronger urge to pee a lot more than usual. Not sure if that's related.
605,ROS,doctor,It could be. We're still waiting on your urine results. Do you have a history of cataracts or glaucoma?
605,ROS,patient,No.
605,ROS,doctor,"Okay, great. Any signs of pneumonia or valley fever?"
605,ROS,patient,Nothing of the sort.
605,ROS,doctor,What about blood in your vomit or feces?
605,ROS,patient,Nope.
605,ROS,doctor,Any neurological symptoms like T I A or C V A? That is slurred speech or stroke symptoms.
605,ROS,patient,"Luckily, no. I don't have seizures or anything like that."
605,ROS,doctor,Great to here. With the pandemic I wanted to check on your mental health too. Any depression or anxiety?
605,ROS,patient,I have always been a homebody. This is normal for me. Nothing like that in my head.
605,ROS,doctor,Cool. Do you have any issues with blood disorders?
605,ROS,patient,Nothing like that.
606,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. It looks like some information is missing for your profile. Is it fine if I ask you a few questions?"
606,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Of course. Go ahead.
606,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you currently smoke?
606,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I finally stopped smoking cigarettes."
606,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you smoke before?
606,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I did. I smoked a half a pack for about twenty years.
606,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Well, it's good to hear that you've stopped. I encourage you to continue to not smoke."
606,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I agree. I need to change up my lifestyle.
606,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Last question. Do you drink alcohol?
606,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't. I don't like anything that has alcohol. I can't stand the taste of it. If I do it is rare."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. So, remind me, how long ago was your procedure?"
607,GENHX,patient,"Let me think. Now, it's been about four months. I just turned fifty nine."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and just to refresh your memory, we did a percutaneous screw fixation of a Schatzker I V tibial plateau fracture, and we've managed those toe fractures nonoperatively."
607,GENHX,patient,Which toes did I break?
607,GENHX,doctor,You broke your second and fifth toes.
607,GENHX,patient,Do you have the x rays? Can I see where the breaks are?
607,GENHX,doctor,"Absolutely, if you look here, right here is where the breaks are. These are called the metatarsal heads."
607,GENHX,patient,"Wow, that's right where it hurts."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Yep, and where are you living now?"
607,GENHX,patient,"Thankfully, I left the nursing home, and I'm back in my own house now."
607,GENHX,doctor,That's really good. Are you in any pain today?
607,GENHX,patient,"No, not today."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Great, have you been going to P T?"
607,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I've been going about two or three times a week."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Are there any signs of infection, like drainage from the incision?"
607,GENHX,patient,"Nope, the wound healed up nicely. I'll be able to wear shorts again."
607,GENHX,doctor,"Great, are you having any fever symptoms, like cough, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, anything like that?"
607,GENHX,patient,"No, but I have had some tingling in both my feet. I don't know if its related to surgery. If I'm remembering the names right, um, I have a history of spinal stenosis and neuropathy in my legs."
607,GENHX,doctor,"With your history of spinal stenosis, the broken toes, and the surgery, that's a pretty normal side effect."
608,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you currently smoke? Or did you smoke in the past?
608,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Quit in nineteen seventy two.
608,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great to hear. Are you working right now?
608,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I work at a nursing home."
608,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does your job allow you to take time for yourself?
608,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, my job is very supportive. I've actually been trying to lose weight. So far, I've lost a good amount since starting a new diet several months back."
609,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Hello. Are you ready for your surgery today?
609,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Can we reschedule? I'm too scared to do it.
609,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,It'll be fine. Don't worry too much about it. Have you ever had a surgery before?
609,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Never. What if something goes wrong?
609,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"You have nothing to worry about. I've done this procedure multiple times, and everyone was fine after."
609,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Thank you, Doctor. Let's get started then."
610,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
610,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't really remember anyone having any major health problems.
610,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
610,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Everyone is pretty healthy.
610,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is fortunate.
610,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, it is."
611,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How's it going? I haven't seen you in a long time.
611,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hey, Doctor. My headaches have been getting worse."
611,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Remind me again. Does you family have a history of migraines.
611,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't think so.
611,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. Let's perform some tests.
612,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, this is your follow up visit, right? Welcome back! Have you been taking your Plaquenil for lupus, ma'am?"
612,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I am."
612,GENHX,doctor,"Your prescription is two hundred M G twice a day, correct?"
612,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's it."
612,GENHX,doctor,Do you have your eye report with you today?
612,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor. Here you go."
612,GENHX,doctor,"Good, thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
612,GENHX,patient,"Well, I'm having some aches and pains in my hands and elbows."
612,GENHX,doctor,When did this pain start?
612,GENHX,patient,It's been a few weeks now.
612,GENHX,doctor,Is there any associated trauma? Did you fall?
612,GENHX,patient,"No, no falls or anything. It just started one day, and it's really bothering me."
612,GENHX,doctor,"Are you having any fever or chills, or cold or flu like symptoms?"
612,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm not."
612,GENHX,doctor,How about swelling? Are any of your joints swollen?
612,GENHX,patient,"No, everything is normal there. Of note, I have been losing a lot of hair recently."
612,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, that's interesting."
613,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, I know you're technically not allowed to drink, but I'm required to ask this anyway. Do you drink at all?"
613,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, actually. I try to steer clear of drinking while training for my marathon."
613,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,When is that by the way?
613,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Next summer.
613,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, good luck. It'll be yet another big accomplishment."
613,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
613,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And how about smoking of any kind?
613,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome in.
614,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let us start with your family medical history.
614,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have a lot of diabetes in the family.
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Who has diabetes?
614,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My father had diabetes. He passed away.
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am so sorry. How did he pass away?
614,FAM/SOCHX,patient,He had cancer. He actually had breast cancer.
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is incredibly rare. Is your mother still with us?
614,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, she is. She just had her eighty ninth birthday. Next year we are going to plan a big birthday bash for her."
614,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any siblings?

615,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How're your other children doing?
615,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,For the same?
615,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Your hands are full then.
615,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,It's definitely been a tough winter for you and your family.
616,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use tobacco or other drugs?
616,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
616,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
616,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
617,GENHX,doctor,Is this your mother with you today?
617,GENHX,patient,"Yes, this is my mommy."
617,GENHX,doctor,"Great, welcome, what did you do this this ankle, young lady?"
617,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was running when I twisted my ankle."
617,GENHX,doctor,Which ankle did you twist?
617,GENHX,patient,It was my right ankle.
617,GENHX,doctor,Where does it hurt the worst?
617,GENHX,patient,"Right here, on the outside of my ankle."
617,GENHX,doctor,Do you have a primary care physician?
617,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other injuries to speak of?
617,GENHX,patient,"No, it's just my ankle really."
618,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, young lady."
618,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hello, doctor."
618,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What grade are you in, young lady?"
618,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm in middle school, um, I'm in the eighth grade."

618,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Great, have you started your periods?"

619,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"How many children do you have, ma'am?"
619,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I was blessed with four beautiful children.
619,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,That's wonderful. Did you have any complications with the pregnancies?
619,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Actually, I had two c sections for both of my sons."
620,GENHX,patient,I'm right handed.
620,GENHX,doctor,"Tell me what brings you here, sir?"
620,GENHX,patient,"I'm having these cramps in my feet, in my hand and I just wanted to get checked. It has been happening for like six months. I develop muscle contractions in my toes and both feet. It only happens in night."
620,GENHX,doctor,How frequent is it?
620,GENHX,patient,Around three times a week.
620,GENHX,doctor,What do you do when you have these cramps?
620,GENHX,patient,"I try to stand and it helps me relieve some of the discomfort. I noticed my toes are kind of extended. Whenever I step on the ground, it seems to pop into place. With all these cramps, I've started having pain in my calf. Sometimes because of that I could not sleep, or it wakes me up in the night. Similar to my toes, these cramps have also started coming up in my hands. They are not that strong or frequent. They're completely random and not in the nighttime. Sometimes my thumb gets so flexed that I have to move it to bring it to the right position and to relieve the cramp."
620,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever have this symptom before?
620,GENHX,patient,"No, not like this."
620,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking any medications?
620,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I took an antibacterial called Bactrim around nine months ago. I was taking it briefly before, but now I'm taking it consistently. I cannot think of anything that is causing it."
620,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other medical condition?
620,GENHX,patient,I have H I V for the last twenty one years and I was taking antiretroviral medications for it. I stopped those medications around six or seven years ago.
620,GENHX,doctor,Why did you stop the medications?
620,GENHX,patient,I could not tolerate them. They were making my stomach weak.
620,GENHX,doctor,Do you know your C D four count?
620,GENHX,patient,It was three hundred and twenty six. I never developed autoimmune deficiency syndrome. I think I should restart my medicines.
621,GENHX,doctor,"So, this is your follow up? How are you doing so far with Lamictal?"
621,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it's the follow up. Lamictal was okay. There was no side effect with that. But I had twitching in my muscles a lot of times. It was not generalized, but I was very afraid that this will happen."
621,GENHX,doctor,What time of day was it? That you had these episodes.
621,GENHX,patient,Mostly in the mornings.
621,GENHX,doctor,"I have your recent E E G report. It did show multiple spikes and some complexes on both the sides, but it is more prominent on left."
621,GENHX,patient,I have been taking my medications very regularly and  I was getting a good amount of sleep as well.
621,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to drive?
621,GENHX,patient,Yes.
621,GENHX,doctor,"Is there any change in your social history or any other symptoms that arise or, or is it same as before?"
621,GENHX,patient,Looks same to me.
622,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,What types of surgeries have you had in the past?
622,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had gall bladder and appendix surgery then they also took out my ovaries.
622,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay.
623,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
623,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, I have, I actually had it to repair an undescended testicle."
623,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Oh, wow, do you remember it at all?"
623,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, nothing about it, I had that done when I was a baby."
624,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
624,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't smoke cigarettes but I do have one on a rare occasion.
624,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
624,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't drink but I do occasionally smoke weed.
624,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
625,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
625,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, neither."
625,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any history of drug abuse?
625,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I have never used any illegal drugs in my life."
625,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
626,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Yes. I suspect they have possible C M V pneumonitis as well.
626,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Yes. They have polymyositis and they're taking Prednisone and Methotrexate.
627,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Alright we already spoke about your past medical history, anything else you might want to add?"
627,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Depression? I don't think we spoke about that.
627,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah we didn't, it slipped out of my mind."
627,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Okay, let me make a note of it."
628,CC,doctor,How are you?
628,CC,patient,Not good.
628,CC,doctor,What brings you here today?
628,CC,patient,This ulcer in my ankle is just not healing.
628,CC,doctor,Is it on both sides?
628,CC,patient,"No, just on the right side."
629,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Do you remember the details of your surgery, sir?"
629,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, can you remind me?"
629,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,We did a left inguinal hernia repair.
629,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Thank you for reminding me.
629,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"You have a history of prostate cancer as well, correct?"
629,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, they said it was Gleason, um, three plus four."
629,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yes, that sounds familiar. What medicines are you taking right now?"
629,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I'm taking Lupron, currently."
630,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How many people do you have in your family?
630,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I have four children, all healthy with no medical conditions."
630,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, that's great!"
630,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My father passed away at the age of sixty nine due to C V A. And my mom died exactly ten years later, her heart just suddenly stopped. She was seventy nine."
630,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. And do you have siblings?
630,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, believe it or not I had eleven siblings, including me twelve."
630,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wow!
630,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I lost six of them. Four of them to diabetes, one of my brothers passed away at the age of seventy two and we could never determine the reason my sister died."
630,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hm okay.
631,CC,doctor,You are referred for some abdominal infection right?
631,CC,patient,"Yes, they told me I might have C Diff?"
631,CC,doctor,Yes that's what we will evaluate you for.
632,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, how are you doing? How old are you?"
632,GENHX,patient,"I am good, how are you? I am seventy two years old."
632,GENHX,doctor,Good. How can I help?
632,GENHX,patient,"Actually, there is a wooden splinter stuck beneath my left fifth fingernail. I am an American farmer by blood, so this has happened before."
632,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, when did this happen, sir?"
632,GENHX,patient,Yesterday evening around four P M.
632,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, then what did you do?"
632,GENHX,patient,"Then I tried to remove it with tweezers at home, but it did not come out. So, I want you to remove this."
632,GENHX,doctor,Okay let me see.
632,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, here."
632,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Can you tell me when the last time you had a tetanus shot?
632,GENHX,patient,Oh it's been so long. I would say it has been over ten years since I have had any tetanus shot.
632,GENHX,doctor,Okay and are you allergic to anything?
632,GENHX,patient,Oh yes. I am allergic to horse serum. I think it is added in vaccinations?
632,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, okay."
632,GENHX,patient,But I don't want any tetanus vaccine now.
632,GENHX,doctor,Oh! But you need it.
632,GENHX,patient,"I know, but I get a bad reaction to vaccines so I don't want it."
632,GENHX,doctor,Okay. let me fine some alternative.
632,GENHX,patient,Thanks.
633,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,Have you had a recent vaccination?
633,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,I had a flu shot last winter but I have not had and recent vaccines.
633,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,Do you have any planned in the near future?
633,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,I was going to get another flu shot but I don't think I am due for that for another three months.
633,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,Great.
634,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
634,GENHX,patient,Seventy one.
634,GENHX,doctor,Are you right handed or left handed?
634,GENHX,patient,Right handed.
634,GENHX,doctor,What exactly happened?
634,GENHX,patient,"I, I had this bad headache on fifth of November and then I had a big sneeze, like it was too loud. I had-- it was going on for like three to four days. Then, on the seventh, I had this severe pain over my left eye and I kind of lost my vision there."
634,GENHX,doctor,When did you see changes in your eyelid?
634,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, on the following day, it seemed like swelling and then my eyelid, it began like pulling down and getting down. Kind of drooping. We went to a local doctor, and he did some x rays."
634,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, I have your brain C T report from there. There is no sign of any kind of bleeding, but I do see a torturous blood vessel there."
634,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, after looking at this report they transferred us here to the U I H C on the twelfth."
635,CC,doctor,I see here that you're in for a med refill. Is that correct?
635,CC,patient,Yep. I ran out of Klonopin one or two days ago.
635,CC,doctor,What are you taking it for? And how long have you been on it?
635,CC,patient,Panic attacks. I have really bad episodes without it. Um I think I started it about four months ago. I could be wrong though. I've lost track of time.
635,CC,doctor,Who usually prescribes it to you?
635,CC,patient,My doctor back in Georgia.
635,CC,doctor,Do you happen to have their name or contact info on hand?
635,CC,patient,"No, unfortunately."
635,CC,doctor,How much Klonopin do you take for your panic attacks?
635,CC,patient,I take a pretty low dose. I think I'm on zero point five milligrams a day. Is there any way you could verify the dosage?
635,CC,doctor,I can try to look it up online. When were you last prescribed Klonopin?
635,CC,patient,Over two months ago I think.
635,CC,doctor,Let me pull up the page and see if we can figure out your dosage and when you're due for a refill based on your doctor's orders.
635,CC,patient,"Okay, thank you."
635,CC,doctor,"Are you experiencing any symptoms currently, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or chest pain?"
635,CC,patient,"Not right now, no. I did have some nausea yesterday. Oh and I guess I had a slight headache when I woke up this morning, but that's about it."
636,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How are you? I haven't seen you in a long time.
636,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm doing fine. I hurt my hand the other day.
636,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How did that happen?
636,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My husband and I moved into our new home, and we were building a desk. I tried to nail something in, and I hammered my hand."
636,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, no. So, you and your husband live together now?"
636,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah. We do. We just got married.
637,GENHX,patient,"Man, what a night."
637,GENHX,doctor,What kind of car were you driving that night?
637,GENHX,patient,I was driving my small sports car through an intersection when another car hit me from the left side. The impact forced my car off the road and into a utility pole.
637,GENHX,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you are here in one piece. Were you wearing your seatbelt?
637,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had my belt on and everything."
637,GENHX,doctor,Good.
637,GENHX,patient,"Unfortunately, the driver was drunk and ran a traffic signal."
637,GENHX,doctor,That's such a shame. Do you remember how fast the car was going when it collided into you?
637,GENHX,patient,If I had to guess maybe eighty miles per hour. It looks like the driver who hit me was already cited by police.
637,GENHX,doctor,Did you lose consciousness at all?
637,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I briefly lost consciousness when help arrived at the scene. I felt an immediate headache when I regained consciousness. I also had lower back and neck pain."
637,GENHX,doctor,Did you get out of the car by yourself?
637,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I got out by myself. Once I made it out, the Rescue Squad drove me to Saint Thomas Memorial Hospital. I was seen in the emergency room and later discharged."
637,GENHX,doctor,"This was on January fifteenth, correct?"
637,GENHX,patient,Yessir.
638,ROS,doctor,How're you doing?
638,ROS,patient,"Good for the most part. I'm still pretty tired most days, but I'm trying to stay more active. I'm wondering if it has to do with my sugar levels?"
638,ROS,doctor,Hm let's see. I'd like to check your glucose and lipid panels and get you back in here again.
638,ROS,patient,And oh I've noticed some blood in my stool. I'm not sure if it's related.
638,ROS,doctor,How long has that been going on?
638,ROS,patient,Maybe a week or so?
638,ROS,doctor,"Are you having any other symptoms? Black or tarry stool? Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea? Lightheadedness?"
638,ROS,patient,"No, none of that."
638,ROS,doctor,I'd like to order a hemoccult then. It's going to check to see if you're still having blood in your stool.
638,ROS,patient,Can I do this at the blood work place?
638,ROS,doctor,"Yes, they'll be able to help you and answer any additional questions you may have."
638,ROS,patient,Okay. I'll try to go in tomorrow.
638,ROS,doctor,"Remember you need to fast for the lipid panel, so I'd recommend going in early tomorrow morning before eating breakfast."
638,ROS,patient,"Okay, got it."
638,ROS,doctor,"And before I send you on your way, have you been able to schedule your yearly mammogram?"
638,ROS,patient,Oh shoot. I still need to do that. I'll call them tomorrow.
639,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. How are you doing?"
639,GENHX,patient,My knees hurt. They've been slowly getting worse each year. Life's getting hard at seventy two.
639,GENHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you always had knee pain?
639,GENHX,patient,I have. Both knees are messed up.
639,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to do any activities still?
639,GENHX,patient,Nope. I just sit all day.
639,GENHX,doctor,I see. We can offer to do arthroplasty to fix your knees.
639,GENHX,patient,What's that?
639,GENHX,doctor,It's like a reconstruction of your joints. It'll help increase your ability to do daily activities.
639,GENHX,patient,I'm up for it. I need to get my life going.
639,GENHX,doctor,Sounds great. I just want to confirm some information. Would you say your quality of life and daily activities is decreasing?
639,GENHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. These knees are making my life terrible."
640,CC,doctor,How's he doing?
640,CC,doctor,How long has it been since you noticed any behavioral changes?
640,CC,doctor,Is he complaining of any pain?
640,CC,doctor,He's been?
640,CC,doctor,No problem.
640,CC,doctor,Is he having any other symptoms?
640,CC,doctor,Any vomiting with the nausea?
641,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir. Remind me please, when was your surgery?"
641,GENHX,patient,"Hello, doctor. It was about a week ago now."
641,GENHX,doctor,"Great, and just to remind you, you had a removal of Ex Fix from the right knee with an M U A following O R I F of a right tibial plateau fracture."
641,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that all sounds familiar. What's M U A?"
641,GENHX,doctor,It stands for manipulation under anesthesia. We bent the knee in order to forcibly break up some scar tissue.
641,GENHX,patient,"Oh, wow."
641,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, it's great, eliminates some need for P T in fact. How are you doing today?"
641,GENHX,patient,"Overall, my pain is under control."
641,GENHX,doctor,"Are you having any flu like, or infection symptoms?"
641,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that at all."
641,GENHX,doctor,"So, no fever, or chills, or sweating at night."
641,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, nothing like that."
641,GENHX,doctor,"Great. I see you're having some drainage from the pin sites, but that doesn't bother me too much."
641,GENHX,patient,"Okay, good. I was getting worried."
641,GENHX,doctor,No need to worry. Are you doing your range of motion exercises? Those are imperative.
641,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor. I am."
641,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and do you have any numbness or tingling?"
641,GENHX,patient,"No, doctor. I don't have any of that."
642,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, how are you doing?"
642,GENHX,patient,I'm good. Thank you.
642,GENHX,doctor,"How old are you, young lady?"
642,GENHX,patient,Eighty four.
642,GENHX,doctor,What brings you here?
642,GENHX,patient,I had a fall. And I was told to consult you for my heart conditions.
642,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?
642,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember."
642,GENHX,doctor,That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first.
642,GENHX,doctor,"Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation."
642,GENHX,patient,Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember.
642,GENHX,doctor,"Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list."
642,GENHX,patient,What does it mean?
642,GENHX,doctor,"It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?"
642,GENHX,patient,"Hm, okay."
642,GENHX,doctor,So tell me what happened? How did you fall?
642,GENHX,patient,"I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock."
642,GENHX,doctor,Which side did you hit the rock?
642,GENHX,patient,Um I think it was left side.
642,GENHX,doctor,What happened in the emergency room?
642,GENHX,patient,They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high.
642,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties."
642,GENHX,doctor,Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird.
642,GENHX,patient,They also did the same test this morning.
642,GENHX,doctor,One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one.
642,GENHX,doctor,How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?
642,GENHX,patient,"I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life."
642,GENHX,doctor,Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?
642,GENHX,patient,"No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident."
642,GENHX,doctor,That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?
642,GENHX,patient,I don't think so.
642,GENHX,doctor,How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?
642,GENHX,patient,Nope.
642,GENHX,doctor,how about shortness of breath?
642,GENHX,patient,"No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems."
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,So just a few quick questions before we wrap up. Do you smoke or drink?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I drink sometimes. I've never smoked.
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any drug use?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you sexually active?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Uh I was back in Haiti, but that was back in eighty two. I had several male partners, but no sex since moving here."
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you use protection in your previous encounters?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Most of the time, yes."
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any history of S T Ds?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
643,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you currently working?
643,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yep. I work for a car dealership down the street.
644,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you taking any medications for your pain?
644,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yeah, occasionally."
644,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Which one?
644,MEDICATIONS,patient,Just a regular pain medicine.
645,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir, I hear you're a patient of Doctor A."
645,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
645,GENHX,doctor,Did she refer you to me?
645,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I'm fifty five, so I'm not too young anymore, but I have developed iron deficiency anemia with blood in my stool. At least, that's what she's told me so far."
645,GENHX,doctor,Are you having diarrhea?
645,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I am."
645,GENHX,doctor,How would you describe the frequency?
645,GENHX,patient,I'd say it's chronic at this point.
645,GENHX,doctor,How long have you known you have anemia?
645,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been a few months now."
645,GENHX,doctor,What markers were evaluated in order to diagnose this?
645,GENHX,patient,"I had, um, an unusual pruritus, and I had a C B C."
645,GENHX,doctor,Do you have the results of that?
645,GENHX,patient,"Yes, right here."
645,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so this shows a hemoglobin of nine, and M C V of sixty five."
645,GENHX,patient,Are those high?
645,GENHX,doctor,"Well, actually, both of those are low."
645,GENHX,patient,"Oh, okay."
645,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had blood in your stool?
645,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been about five months now."
645,GENHX,doctor,What has the color been like?
645,GENHX,patient,"Well, it's been both dark and bright blood, actually?"
645,GENHX,doctor,When was your last colonoscopy?
645,GENHX,patient,"It was about three years ago, I had it with Doctor X. I did it in Las Cruces."
645,GENHX,doctor,Was there any abnormality found?
645,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had polyps removed."
645,GENHX,doctor,Were those polyps evaluated?
645,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, the doctors said they were, um, hyperplastic. They diagnosed me with, um, lymphocytic colitis."
645,GENHX,doctor,"I see, when was the last time you were treated for diarrhea?"
645,GENHX,patient,"At this point, it's been more than three years."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Good afternoon, before we begin, what are your pronouns?"
646,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"I identify as a female, and I use she her pronouns."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Thank you, so, have you ever had surgery?"
646,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I actually have a list of them written down."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"That's really helpful, may I see it?"
646,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Absolutely, here you go."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Thank you. So I see you've had a multiple bowel surgeries, including, um, a hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and an appendectomy. Do all of those sound familiar."
646,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yep, I got this list from all of the surgeons."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Are there any other major conditions I should be aware of?
646,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, actually, I have another list, um, I have polymyalgia rheumatica."
646,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"That's all great information to know, thank you very much."
647,GENHX,doctor,"Hello Mister Strange, can you please confirm your age and ethnicity for the records."
647,GENHX,patient,"Hi Doctor, I am fifty five now and would identify myself as a white male."
647,GENHX,doctor,"Let's first talk about your medical condition. There has been a diagnosis of polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis. Also, you are J A K two positive. Do you remember when you were diagnosed?"
647,GENHX,patient,It was sometimes between two thousand and five and six.
647,GENHX,doctor,They did phlebotomy and then subsequently you got yourself transferred here in our healthcare.
647,GENHX,patient,Yes.
647,GENHX,doctor,"You have been on hydroxyurea and interferon, right?"
647,GENHX,patient,"Oh, it was a terrible time, I could not deal with anyone of them. I had numbness and tingling with burning pain in my hands."
647,GENHX,doctor,You do not have any siblings that we can try for transplant match?
647,GENHX,patient,That's right!
647,GENHX,doctor,"You were also considered for the Matched Unrelated Donor Transplant, but you couldn't be on the list due to social support and also health was in reasonably better state than other candidates normally on that transplant list."
647,GENHX,patient,"We had some medications here as well when I first started my care here, I forgot the name."
647,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, here we started you on a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for some time. You were doing great on that for a while, but then you developed intolerance to lenalidomide."
647,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I had severe diarrhea and I always felt tired like I have no energy left in me. Eventually it all stopped."
647,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, here it says that you injured your leg? Tell me what happened."
647,GENHX,patient,"It all happened last week, I injured this left leg and got swelling. I had some prescribed steroids, so I took them for about three days only. The swelling is eventually gone now."
647,GENHX,doctor,Any other related complaints?
647,GENHX,patient,No.
647,GENHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
647,GENHX,patient,"I take marijuana. I feel really hungry after smoking it, so I eat a lot. In just the last few weeks I have gained a few pounds."
647,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, your overall performance status in the E C O G scale is one."
648,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have any family history of neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or dementia?"
648,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope. Fortunately, no one in my family has neurological problems."
649,CC,doctor,How long have you had this rash?
649,CC,patient,Not long. Less than a day if I had to guess.
649,CC,doctor,Is it causing you any pain?
649,CC,patient,"No, it's just really itchy. I tried applying Cortisone to it, but it didn't help much."
649,CC,doctor,Is the rash localized to the left arm?
649,CC,patient,Yeah. I've only noticed it on my left arm.
650,GENHX,doctor,Hello. How are you both doing today?
650,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did he have a fracture before?
650,GENHX,doctor,"Great. Let me take a look. It looks like he had a distracted left lateral condyle fracture. He then underwent screw compression to fix the fracture, correct?"
650,GENHX,doctor,"Perfect. So, now we just have to remove the hardware that was used to fix the fracture, right?"
650,GENHX,doctor,"The risks include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion."
650,GENHX,doctor,"Of course. Before I do, I just need to confirm your son's age."
650,GENHX,patient,Hi. I'm five years old. My birthday is in four months.
650,GENHX,doctor,Thank you. Happy almost birthday.
651,IMAGING,doctor,I am looking at her x ray report and she had a sternotomy in the past.
651,IMAGING,doctor,Oh I see!
652,CC,doctor,What happened to your right leg?
652,CC,patient,"I had a little accident with a dog, he bit me. I got really scared."
652,CC,doctor,Don't worry we will take care of this.
653,GENHX,doctor,"We've been following you for several conditions for a while now. What seems to be the problem today, sir?"
653,GENHX,patient,"Um, I was peeing blood, it's back again."
653,GENHX,doctor,Did you do anything that could have provoked it to come back?
653,GENHX,patient,"No, not that I know of."
653,GENHX,doctor,Have you been taking the Flomax for your B P H?
653,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have been."
653,GENHX,doctor,What about the Coumadin?
653,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I've been taking that too. It has been held recently, but I ususally take it."
653,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, I don't have my chart with me. What conditions have you been taking the Coumadin for?"
653,GENHX,patient,I have A F I B and stroke.
653,GENHX,doctor,Thank you. Isn't this your second occurrence of gross hematuria this month?
653,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor."
653,GENHX,doctor,Are you sure you haven't experienced any falls or anything recently?
653,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, actually I fell about a week ago."
653,GENHX,doctor,Where is your pain from that fall?
653,GENHX,patient,It's in my butt and leg.
653,GENHX,doctor,Have you had your x rays taken yet?
653,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, the x ray tech just brought me back."
653,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, these x rays of the hips, knees, and ankles show severe degeneration in all areas."
653,GENHX,patient,"What does that mean, doctor?"
653,GENHX,doctor,I see some pretty significant arthritis in these areas.
653,GENHX,patient,"Can you tell me some good news, please?"
653,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I don't see any fractures."
653,GENHX,patient,I guess that's something.
653,GENHX,doctor,When is your pain worst?
653,GENHX,patient,"It's so severe, and it's worst first thing in the morning."
653,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I know you are, but be sure to keep taking the Coumadin, that helps with the stroke and A F I B."
653,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I will. I'm having problems with my sinuses today too. Can I get some nasal spray too?"
654,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Good morning.
654,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Good morning, Doctor."
654,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
654,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No sir, I'm happily single."
654,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good for you, what do you do for a living?"
654,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm actually not working right now, I go to college full time."
654,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Even better for you, so do you drink or smoke?"
654,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't."
654,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about more illicit substances?

702,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. I am unemployed. I have not completed my collage degree yet. I have been in school for the last two years.
702,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Keep at it.
703,GENHX,doctor,"Nurse, do you have a report on my patient?"
703,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, no. Did she get chemotherapy?"
703,GENHX,doctor,How are her symptoms now?
703,GENHX,doctor,I see. Does she have any imaging done?
703,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go see her now."
703,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today?"
703,GENHX,patient,I wanted to see if I could get some treatment for my pain.
703,GENHX,doctor,What kind of pain are you having?
703,GENHX,patient,I feel like it's a burning feeling? I don't know. I can feel it one spot and then it spreads down.
703,GENHX,doctor,I see. Where do you feel the pain?
703,GENHX,patient,I feel it mostly on my lower right side of my back.
703,GENHX,doctor,Do you feel it anywhere else?
703,GENHX,patient,The back of my right leg and knee.
703,GENHX,doctor,Would you said the pain radiates down from your back to your knee?
703,GENHX,patient,That's it. Radiating. I forgot the word.
703,GENHX,doctor,"No problem. On a scale from zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain of your life, how would you rate your back and leg?"
703,GENHX,patient,They're both a ten.
703,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. Do you feel pain anywhere else?"
703,GENHX,patient,Yes. Could you check my feet?
703,GENHX,doctor,Let me check them. I'll feel around your left foot. Let me know what you feel.
703,GENHX,patient,I feel like the bottom is numb. Ouch. It also feels sharp at times too.
703,GENHX,doctor,I see. The nurse stated here that you had some pain spreading to your mid back too. Let me feel it really quick. Let me know how that feels.
703,GENHX,patient,"Ouch! It hurts a lot. I feel a sharp and dull pain. Most of the time, it's just aching."
703,GENHX,doctor,I see. When do you feel like the pain in your body gets the worst?
703,GENHX,patient,I'd say when I'm sitting in a car for a long time.
703,GENHX,doctor,"So, just sitting for long periods of time?"
703,GENHX,patient,"Yeah. When I stand and walk, too."
703,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever taken anything for the pain?
703,GENHX,patient,I am on a load of narcotics for the pain.
704,ROS,doctor,"Any fever, chills or rigors?"
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,Any blurring of vision or history of glaucoma or cataract?
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,Did you experience any shortness of breath?
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,Any stomach discomfort?
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,Did you observe blood in your stool or in vomit?
704,ROS,patient,"No, nothing like that."
704,ROS,doctor,"Okay, good. Did you notice any increase in your urine frequency or urgency?"
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,Do you feel any muscle weakness or tiredness?
704,ROS,patient,"No, nothing of that sort."
704,ROS,doctor,Any known history of arthritis?
704,ROS,patient,Nope.
704,ROS,doctor,"And no fever due to any fungal infection or anything, right? Like valley fever?"
704,ROS,patient,"No, nothing of that sort."
704,ROS,doctor,Any history of pneumonia?
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,"And I am looking at your chart, so no history of stroke, C V A, or any seizure disorder."
704,ROS,patient,That's correct.
704,ROS,doctor,No thyroid or hormone related problem?
704,ROS,patient,No.
704,ROS,doctor,"And you do not have any blood disorders, right?"
704,ROS,patient,That is right.
705,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Have you experienced any diarrhea?
705,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes. I have been having diarrhea. When I think about it, it started happening around the same time that the mouth sores started. I didn't have any diarrhea today though."
705,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Have you experienced any episodes of nausea or vomiting?
705,ASSESSMENT,patient,No.
705,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Have you noticed any blood in your bowel movements?
705,ASSESSMENT,patient,No.
705,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Even though you have been taking the medications without any issue, for about ten years, the methotrexate may be the cause of the mouth sores and the inflammation in the small intestines. These are both common side effects from the use of methotrexate. I am not as familiar with NSAID's causing mouth sores. Aspirin use can cause gastrointestinal upset. I think the most likely cause of the sores is the methotrexate not the use of Aspirin."
706,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you on insulin?
706,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes.
706,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you on metformin as well?
706,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes.
706,MEDICATIONS,doctor,How about glucotrol?
706,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes I take that.
706,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you on lipitor?
706,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes.
707,EDCOURSE,doctor,"Epi one M G, zero point three M L subcutaneously along with fifty M G of Benadryl intramuscularly. In about fifteen to twenty minutes, he reported his itching had improved. The rash itself faded a little bit and he began to feel a lot more comfortable."
708,ROS,doctor,"Hello, how are you?"
708,ROS,patient,"I am good, Doctor."
708,ROS,doctor,"So, what brings you here today?"
708,ROS,patient,"Well, I have many medical issues and I see Doctor X for them, but I wanted a second opinion, so he referred me here."
708,ROS,doctor,"Yeah, he is a good man! Don't worry we will take care of you."
708,ROS,patient,Thank you.
708,ROS,doctor,"So, let me start by getting your medical history."
708,ROS,patient,"Sure, I had skin cancer which was treated by removal of that part."
708,ROS,doctor,Okay.
708,ROS,patient,"Other than that, I have anemia and an acid reflux problem. I also have history of C O P D."
708,ROS,doctor,Alright.
708,ROS,patient,I also suffer from sciatica which was caused mainly due to my arthritis.
708,ROS,doctor,I see.
709,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome back to Sample Clinic, Mister Sample."
709,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
709,GENHX,doctor,"What seems to be the problem today, sir?"
709,GENHX,patient,I'm having a lot of pain in my right heel.
709,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had this pain?
709,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been about two weeks now."

709,GENHX,patient,"Well, nothing to date."
709,GENHX,doctor,Where is your heel pain?
709,GENHX,patient,"It's on the right heel, then it's on the inside bottom part of the heel and into the inside of the heel."
709,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any change in your medical history since your last visit?
709,GENHX,patient,"No, it's the same old same old."
709,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any flu like symptoms?
709,GENHX,patient,Like fever or chills?
709,GENHX,doctor,"That, or vomiting or headaches."
709,GENHX,patient,"Oh, no I don't have anything like that."
709,GENHX,doctor,What about chest pain or shortness of breath?
709,GENHX,patient,"Thankfully, no nothing like that."
710,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
710,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My family has a high blood pressure. I have a family member that had colon cancer.  My daughter has a twitch. They don't know what caused it?
710,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
711,GENHX,doctor,"Hello Miss Long, I see that you have been referred today by A B C, D O, for a reevaluation. Are you having issues with your hand eczema again?"
711,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it has been flaring."
711,GENHX,doctor,Can you confirm your age for the records please?
711,GENHX,patient,"Sure, I'm twenty nine."
711,GENHX,doctor,"If I'm not wrong, you are from Vietnam, right?"
711,GENHX,patient,That's right.
711,GENHX,doctor,Are you married? Single or with a partner?
711,GENHX,patient,I'm single.
711,GENHX,doctor,Are you working somewhere?
711,GENHX,patient,"No, currently I'm unemployed."
711,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, since you are an established patient here in our dermatology department, let me just update all your information into the records."
711,GENHX,doctor,Okay according to my records we have last seen you here in our office on July thirteenth of two thousand and four.
711,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
711,GENHX,doctor,I have previously treated you with Aristocort cream and Cetaphil cream. I also ask you to increase your moisturizing cream and lotion and asked you to wash your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.
711,GENHX,patient,"I've been doing all that, but now it looks like my eczema is flaring. I have these cracks in my hands and they feel very dry."
711,GENHX,doctor,Have you been washing your hands with Cetaphil cleansing lotion?
711,GENHX,patient,"No, I was using soap. The Cetaphil cleansing lotion was not working.  I had a lot of pain and burning sensation whenever I tried to use that."
711,GENHX,doctor,It may be because of the fissures. I mean those cracks in your hands.
711,GENHX,patient,I have been wearing gloves as much as I can.
711,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
712,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Have you been applying Triamcinolone zero point one percent three times a day to your rash?
712,MEDICATIONS,patient,The one on my left wrist?
712,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Yes. And Bactroban ointment is also three times a day as needed for your bug bites.
712,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yep.
712,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you still using Nystatin on your lips once a day as needed?
712,MEDICATIONS,patient,Uh yeah. I've been using it much less now.
712,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"So let's see, your other medications are the same as of July thirtieth O four with the exception of Klonopin?"
712,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yeah, I mean I'm taking four M G in the morning and six M G at night instead of the six M G and eight M G that was recommended. I feel like I do better with the lower doses."
713,ROS,doctor,"So, I am looking at your reports, you don't have anemia or any other blood disorders."
713,ROS,patient,"Well, that's a relief!"
713,ROS,doctor,Yeah.
713,ROS,doctor,Let me check your lymph nodes. They are nonpalpable. I don't see any swollen glands or anything.
713,ROS,patient,Great!
714,GENHX,doctor,"I am well, how's the baby? I see that he is eight pounds and thirteen ounces, and he was born via…?"
714,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I would like to ask you some questions about the pregnancy and other history."
714,GENHX,doctor,"Great, have you had any infections during pregnancy like G B S or S T D infections?"
714,GENHX,doctor,Did you smoke during pregnancy?
714,GENHX,doctor,"Sir, have you had any S T D while she was pregnant?"
714,GENHX,doctor,"Great, so looks like you were discharged in forty eight hours and no more hospital stays for you."
715,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Welcome to the clinic, sir. I am Doctor Jones."
715,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. It is nice to meet you.
715,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use tobacco products?

717,DISPOSITION,doctor,Do you want to go home?

719,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Unless they did it while I was sleeping, but none that I can remember."
720,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I remember you had mentioned that one of your family members had bone cancer. Are there any other medical problems that run in your family?
720,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sadly, yes. Stroke and dementia are the other two big ones."
720,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that.
721,ALLERGY,doctor,Are you allergic to any meds?
721,ALLERGY,patient,Me?
721,ALLERGY,doctor,Yes.
721,ALLERGY,patient,"No, I am not."

721,ALLERGY,patient,"Yes, I am damn sure."
721,ALLERGY,doctor,Okay great!
722,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,What's bringing her in today?
722,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,I understand. I'm sorry to hear that she hasn't been feeling well. Let me see what we can do for her today.
722,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,What time did she wake up today?
722,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,It looks like she has an upper respiratory infection.
722,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,"Yes, she should feel better once we start treating the infection. But I'm worried it may be pertussis."
723,CC,doctor,"And you've had recurring abscesses for the past two years, correct?"
723,CC,patient,"Unfortunately, yes."
723,CC,doctor,Where have they been located?
723,CC,patient,Um in the public area and my thighs.

728,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, how did he hurt himself?"
728,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, and we did O R I F on his fracture dislocation of the left elbow."
728,GENHX,doctor,Which hand does he write with?
728,GENHX,doctor,Okay. That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today?
728,GENHX,doctor,"That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand."
728,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent."
728,GENHX,doctor,"We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean. Other Risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness."
728,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, we'll use anesthesia, he won't feel a thing."
728,GENHX,doctor,"I can't guarantee it, he may still be in some pain."
729,GENHX,doctor,"Since you have a family history of coronary heart disease, let me check you for its risk factors."
729,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, my father had it."
729,GENHX,doctor,Any history of high blood pressure or diabetes?
729,GENHX,patient,No.
729,GENHX,doctor,"How about smoking, do you smoke?"
729,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't smoke."
729,GENHX,doctor,"And in the past, did any other Doctor mention that you might have sign or symptom indicating that you may have coronary artery disease?"
729,GENHX,patient,No.
729,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
730,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Who all are there in your family?
730,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Everyone living together?
730,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is she going to any daycare?
731,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
731,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, I do but occasionally. Who doesn't like a nice cocktail!"
731,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay. How about cigarettes, do you smoke?"
731,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't smoke."
732,CC,doctor,I am okay.
732,CC,patient,I have bad nausea.
732,CC,doctor,"Oh, so sorry."
732,CC,patient,And I feel very dizzy like I am going to faint.
732,CC,doctor,Okay let me see what is going on.
732,CC,patient,Okay.
733,CC,doctor,What brings you into the office today?
733,CC,patient,I had a stroke about a month ago. The right side of my face is still not moving.
733,CC,doctor,Is it only the right side of the face that is affected by paralysis?
733,CC,patient,Yes. It has improved a little bit since I was in the hospital.
733,CC,doctor,That is a good sign. It can take up to six months see how much movement you will regain.
734,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use tobacco?
734,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"What, like smoke cigarettes?"
734,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yes ma'am, do you?"
734,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, no. I don't do anything like that."
735,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
735,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I had it for melanoma some time ago."
735,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"I see here that you had a hysterectomy as well, is that correct?"
735,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh, yes, that's true. I had that done too."
736,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, let's see here. You don't recall anyone in your family having a history of neuromuscular diseases, correct?"
736,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, no one I can think of."
736,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know of anyone who has had foot deformities or neuropathy in their arms or legs?
736,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, not one person comes to mind."
736,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great. Does anyone in your immediate family have a high arch?
736,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, at least no one that I know of."
736,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And you said that your aunt or sister has type two diabetes?
736,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My aunt. She's had it for some time now.
737,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"So, what I feel is you might have short term memory loss due to high stress, but I also feel it's probably due to your current situation. The other impression I have is that you have anxiety issues and again it's stress related."
737,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yeah, I do have anxiety issues."
738,GENHX,doctor,Who's my patient today?
738,GENHX,doctor,What seems to be the problem today?
738,GENHX,doctor,Has he changed his diet?
738,GENHX,doctor,What kinds of foods did he eliminate?
738,GENHX,patient,"Oh, you know, all of the fun ones. Like cappuccino, quiche, crescents, candy, vending machines, all of that stuff."
738,GENHX,doctor,Do you take your lunch to work?
738,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I do about three or four times a week instead of eating out so much."
738,GENHX,doctor,Are you exercising right now?
738,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I do about six or seven days a week."
738,GENHX,doctor,What kind do you like to do?
738,GENHX,patient,"Well, I do just about everything. I swim, I bike, run and then I lift weights."
738,GENHX,doctor,How long do you workout per day?
738,GENHX,patient,"Usually, it's about one and a half to two and a half hours every day."
738,GENHX,doctor,"Good, are you training for anything specific?"
738,GENHX,patient,"Actually, yes I'm going to do a triathlon."
738,GENHX,doctor,Can I assume you're losing weight?
738,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I am."
739,CC,doctor,The patient has possible free air in their diaphragm.
739,CC,doctor,Seventy six.
739,CC,doctor,Unknown as of now.
740,GENHX,doctor,"Out of ten, ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today?"
740,GENHX,patient,"Today it's about a six or seven, and it's usually pretty constant there."
740,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain change with the weather?
740,GENHX,patient,"Yes, when it's cold out it turns to ten out of ten. It's better when it's warm out."
740,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain change throughout the course of the day?
740,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it progressively gets worse and worse as the day goes on, but I also have a pretty hard time getting out of bed in the morning, too."
740,GENHX,doctor,"Out of ten, how would you rate your pain at night?"
740,GENHX,patient,"Oh, it's ten out of ten."
740,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain wake you up at night?
740,GENHX,patient,"If I sleep at all. I'm not sleeping well at all, and when I do it's for less than an hour at a time."
740,GENHX,doctor,Are there any activities that really aggravate the pain?
740,GENHX,patient,"Yes, if I sit for more than about twenty minutes, or if I lay flat on my back."
740,GENHX,doctor,Does anything alleviate the pain?
740,GENHX,patient,Laying on my side helps a little.
741,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. It's mentioned in her report that she has a history of smoking.
741,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Well, it's alright. I think it's going to be difficult taking any past medical information from her."
742,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Have you been taking anything for high blood pressure?
742,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yeah, I started taking Toprol and uh the one that starts with an A. I forget what it's called."
742,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Hm are you talking about Avalide?
742,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Oh right, yeah that's the one."
743,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am. Before we begin, may I ask how old you are?"
743,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor. I'm fifty six years old, now."
743,GENHX,doctor,"Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am?"
743,GENHX,patient,"Well, I need some support for dietary recommendations for healthy eating for my husband and me."
743,GENHX,doctor,"Why would that be, ma'am?"
743,GENHX,patient,"Um, I have a lot going on, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, acid reflux, and I just want to lose some weight. My husband has high cholesterol too."
743,GENHX,doctor,"Tell me more about your eating habits, please."
743,GENHX,patient,"Well, we live by ourselves now that our children are gone, but I'm used to cooking really large portions."
743,GENHX,doctor,Are you struggling to make food for just two people?
743,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's a good way to put it. I'd like to just make less food, that way we're not so tempted to eat so much."
743,GENHX,doctor,"I understand, are you busy, do you work?"
743,GENHX,patient,"Well, I start a new job this week."

750,ROS,doctor,You're in the emergency room.

750,ROS,patient,I'm no longer at the bar?
750,ROS,doctor,"No, you're here because someone was worried you may need medical attention."
750,ROS,patient,I don't know what's going on. Can you call my girlfriend? She was there with me before we got into a fight.
751,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How's your husband doing?
751,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"He's good. He usually comes with me to my appointments, but he had to run some errands this morning."

756,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh, sorry I didn't mean to interrupt."
756,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,It's alright. I just wanted to know if that polyp was found in your colon?
756,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, it was."
757,CC,doctor,Yes for sure.
758,GENHX,doctor,Where's your rash?
758,GENHX,patient,All over my torso and arms.
758,GENHX,doctor,When did you first notice it?
758,GENHX,patient,"Well, it started on my back and then it made its way to my torso and arms."
758,GENHX,doctor,Have you found yourself itching it?
758,GENHX,patient,Yes.
758,GENHX,doctor,"Any potential triggers for the rash, such as dietary changes, new medications, or unfamiliar exposures?"

759,ALLERGY,patient,Break out in a terrible rash. I remember I had to go to the E R the first and last time I took it.
759,ALLERGY,doctor,"Wow, I'm sorry. Rashes can be very uncomfortable and sometimes require immediate attention."
759,ALLERGY,patient,"Yeah, so no more Sulfa drugs for me. That's for sure."
760,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
760,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
760,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you smoke?
760,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Honestly, I smoke every day."

762,CC,patient,Right above my belly button. It's been bothering me for three weeks now.
762,CC,doctor,Does the pain come and go?
762,CC,patient,"Um it's pretty constant, but it does seem to get worse at night."
762,CC,doctor,Do you find that sitting or laying down in certain positions helps the pain?
762,CC,patient,Eh not really. I can't seem to really get comfortable since it started.
762,CC,doctor,Have you taken any medicine for the pain?
762,CC,patient,I uh-
762,CC,doctor,Yes?
762,CC,patient,"Um I took Pepto Bismol a few times, but that didn't do much."
762,CC,doctor,Did they already take you back for your C T scan?
762,CC,patient,Yeah.
762,CC,doctor,"We should be getting the results of your scan fairly soon then. In the meantime, I'm going to put in some additional orders."
763,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor."
763,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, I've reviewed your past notes, are there any other diagnoses I should know about?"
763,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, I've had depression for a while now."
763,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Thank you for sharing that with me.

764,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't do any of that."
764,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, and do you use anything harder? Like illicit drugs?"
764,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I absolutely do not."
764,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, and with ten being the most stressful day every, how would you rate your stress level out of ten?"
764,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Today, I'd say its about an eight out of ten."
765,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hello. How are you doing today?
765,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,My head has been hurting a lot.
765,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see. Did the nurse come in and ask you questions about past medical history?
765,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Perfect. Let's do some tests to see why your head has been hurting.
765,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I'm ready for less pain. Let's go.
766,EXAM,doctor,We're going to check around your knee now.
766,EXAM,patient,"Okay, sounds good."
766,EXAM,doctor,Looks like your deep tendon reflexes are the same on both legs. Sensation seems great and intact.

768,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Alright, I am looking at your urine report and it confirms what I was suspecting. You have a urinary tract infection."
768,ASSESSMENT,patient,"I kind of knew it was a U T I. I have had it before, but nothing this painful and severe. I feel like I am going to die!"
768,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Oh yes, it is because you got something called as acute cystitis and its usually very painful and can cause some serious complications."
768,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Well, is it because of my diabetes?"
768,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"I am afraid I don't have better news for you, but your diabetes is out of control. It's way too high and you must be really careful. Are you taking your medicines?"
768,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yes!
768,ASSESSMENT,doctor,How bout diet?
768,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yeah, sometimes I don't care about my diet."
768,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Well, you must watch your diet, you can't just be careless. I am going to change your diabetes medication. And let's start you on the antibiotic that should give you relief. Also stay hydrated drink plenty of fluids it will help you flush the infection out."

770,CC,doctor,Hi there! I am Doctor Sherman.
770,CC,patient,Hello! It is nice to meet you.
770,CC,doctor,It looks like your P C P sent you to us for a possible prostate problem.
770,CC,patient,Yes. I am nervous.
770,CC,doctor,"Do not be nervous. We will start with discussing the symptoms you have been experiencing, a physical exam and then we will get a urine sample if you are able."
770,CC,patient,Okay.
771,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What are you taking for allergies?
771,MEDICATIONS,patient,Claritin.
771,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay.
771,MEDICATIONS,patient,For my allergic rhinitis.
772,ALLERGY,doctor,Do you have any known allergies to medication?

774,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir how are you feeling today?"
774,GENHX,patient,I feel terrible. Very sick and I can barely move. I feel so weak.
775,IMAGING,doctor,"So, we looked at your previous blood work results, now let me see what these reports say from today's C B C exam."
775,IMAGING,patient,Sure.
775,IMAGING,doctor,"Okay so your hemoglobin levels look within range, white counts are thirteen point three, then seven point six lymphocytes and twenty six thousand platelets."
775,IMAGING,doctor,Okay?
775,IMAGING,patient,Okay.
776,GENHX,doctor,Welcome back.
776,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
776,GENHX,doctor,"You are back for a follow up on your right arm pain, right?"
776,GENHX,patient,Yes. It has been almost a year since the pain first started.
776,GENHX,doctor,How has your arm been feeling?
776,GENHX,patient,I still have this dull pain in my upper outer area of my arm.
776,GENHX,doctor,How long does the pain last?
776,GENHX,patient,"It was coming and going, but now the pain is more persistent since I last saw you. It is still happening every day."
776,GENHX,doctor,Remind me again. You are right handed. Right?
776,GENHX,patient,Yeah. It makes is hard to do things with the persistent pain.
776,GENHX,doctor,I bet it does. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensation in your arm or hand?
776,GENHX,patient,"No, but I have had this achy sensation in my hand radiating down to my fingers."
776,GENHX,doctor,Do you have a history of any other neck or shoulder injuries?
776,GENHX,patient,It is not from a specific injury but I have had this neck pain for thirty years.
776,GENHX,doctor,Did you see anyone for the neck pain?
776,GENHX,patient,"Yes. I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections."
776,GENHX,doctor,Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections?
776,GENHX,patient,Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven.
776,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
776,GENHX,patient,I am fifty eight.
776,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections?
776,GENHX,patient,"Those are for neck pain. My arm pain recent. I have been having the injections for a while now, without any trouble."
776,GENHX,doctor,What medications have you been taking for the pain?
776,GENHX,patient,There are a few of them that I take. I gave the list to the nurse.
776,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
776,GENHX,patient,I also have taken several Medrol packs. They make my blood sugars to increase so I try not to take it.
776,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Does the pain prevent you from doing your daily activities or decrease your quality of life?
776,GENHX,patient,"No. I can do everything like normal, but constant nagging pain does get to me at times."
777,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,What type of surgery have you had in past? Anything big or small?
777,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a C section for my kiddo and one D and C.
777,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay.
778,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you currently taking any medications?
778,MEDICATIONS,patient,No.
779,ALLERGY,doctor,So are you allergic-
779,ALLERGY,patient,To any medications? No allergies here.
780,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hello again!
780,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hi!
780,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,The results from you M R I showed nothing concerning.  The growth factors were normal with normal cell function and no signs of decreased blood supply to the brain.
780,FAM/SOCHX,patient,That's great news.
780,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Yes it is.
781,GENHX,doctor,"So, I understand that you had a fall."
781,GENHX,patient,Yes. I did fall.
781,GENHX,doctor,What happened?
781,GENHX,patient,I don't really know. I have balancing problems. I have been to my P C P for this issue a few days ago. I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh.  I have been having trouble with my right hand. It is like I am clumsy on my right side. I ended up falling because my right hand missed the railing when I grabbed it to head up the stairs.
781,GENHX,doctor,Are you left or right handed?
781,GENHX,patient,Right.
781,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me a little bit more about the trouble that you are having with the right hand? Is it localized to the right hand?
781,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it is only on my right side. It is like the right side of my body is weak and it has been getting worse."
781,GENHX,doctor,How long has this issue been progressing for?
781,GENHX,patient,About two years.
781,GENHX,doctor,Have you experienced any blurred vision or visual disturbances?
781,GENHX,patient,Yes. Every once and a while.
781,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
781,GENHX,patient,I just turned fifty eight last week.
781,GENHX,doctor,Happy belated birthday!
781,GENHX,patient,Thank you!
781,GENHX,doctor,Did your P C P have any bloodwork or imaging done?
781,GENHX,patient,"Yes, she did. She did both. She said she would send my records over."
781,GENHX,doctor,Oh. I see it here! Did Doctor Madison discuss the results of your H C T and the M R I yet?
781,GENHX,patient,No.
781,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. The results showed clinoid masses. This explains that problems that you have been having with your right side, your balancing problems, and the visual disturbances. With only the M R I I cannot tell if the masses are malignant or not."
781,GENHX,patient,"So, are the masses cancer?"
781,GENHX,doctor,I don't know yet. I will have to run some more tests and potently have to do a biopsy.
781,GENHX,patient,Okay.
782,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
782,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I do."
782,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much? I mean can you tell me approximate amount?
782,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes sure, I smoke half a pack a day."
782,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about alcohol and drugs?
782,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I do not drink or use. I have a five month old baby."
783,GENHX,doctor,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today out of ten, ma'am?"
783,GENHX,patient,"Well, out of ten, I'd say it's about a seven."
783,GENHX,doctor,How would you describe your pain?
783,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'd say it's deep, and it really aches."
783,GENHX,doctor,Where is your pain located?
783,GENHX,patient,"It's in my right lower back, and then into my butt."
783,GENHX,doctor,What activities make your surgery worse?
783,GENHX,patient,"I can't go up and down stairs without a lot of pain, and it hurts when I sit for a long time, like when I drive."
783,GENHX,doctor,"Before this pain, how would you describe your activity level?"
783,GENHX,patient,I was very active before all this started.
783,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to do any of your prior activities?
783,GENHX,patient,"Not really, I'm having a lot of problems with stuff around the house, like all the chores and projects I used to be able to do."
784,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Welcome in!
784,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Thank you.
784,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Let us get a little background. What is your medical history?
784,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I have some memory loss problems.
784,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What kind of memory problems?
784,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, I have seizures."
784,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you know what kind of seizures that you have?

785,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Nope.
785,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,What about surgery.
785,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, I never had a surgery."
786,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
786,GENHX,patient,I am seventy three.
786,GENHX,doctor,Are you right handed or left handed?
786,GENHX,patient,Right.
786,GENHX,doctor,"So, I see the chief complaint is memory loss and cognitive decline. Tell me what exactly happened, and how did you notice the symptoms? Let me document that today is January twelfth of nineteen ninety five."
786,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
786,GENHX,doctor,I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations.
786,GENHX,doctor,Was she slurring?
786,GENHX,doctor,Was there any difficulty with vision? Or any weakness?
786,GENHX,doctor,How was it after returning from there?
786,GENHX,patient,I was not able to take on with my usual task of flower arrangements or dealing with the cash at the cash register.
786,GENHX,doctor,How was it after that?
786,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more?"
787,ALLERGY,doctor,You are not allergic to anything?
787,ALLERGY,patient,"No, I am not."
787,ALLERGY,doctor,Any food or other pollen?

788,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yeah.
789,GENHX,doctor,How old is the baby?
789,GENHX,doctor,What brings you here today?
789,GENHX,doctor,How was your pregnancy?
789,GENHX,doctor,Is this the only child?
789,GENHX,doctor,How much did he weigh at birth?
789,GENHX,doctor,Did you remember his milestones?
789,GENHX,doctor,What issues are he facing right now?
789,GENHX,doctor,How about his speech? How many words do you think he knows?
789,GENHX,doctor,Is he able to speak two word phrases?
789,GENHX,doctor,Any other unusual behavior that you noticed? Any seizures or just the quivering movement of the jaw?
790,CC,doctor,What brings you back into the clinic today?
790,CC,patient,I have been having some severe bruising. I have been taking Coumadin for three months now. Am I taking to much Coumadin?
790,CC,doctor,"You are taking a normal start dose. Some people do not metabolize the medication as well as others. I would like to get you tested for hypersensitivity. After we get the test results back, we will be able to adjust your dosage accordingly."
790,CC,patient,Okay.
791,ROS,doctor,"Let me examine you. Tell me, did you have any fever or chills, any sweating or that sort of thing?"

791,ROS,doctor,How about abnormal weight loss or weight gain?

791,ROS,patient,"No, no chest pain and shortness of breath."

800,GENHX,doctor,Great way to get some exercise in.
800,GENHX,doctor,ok so what's going on?
800,GENHX,patient,I am having a bellyache.
800,GENHX,doctor,Since when?
800,GENHX,patient,"Oh, it's been a while now."
800,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me more about your pain like how did it start and what exactly are you feeling?

800,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me if it is stabbing pain and if it is related to any specific time of the day?
800,GENHX,patient,"Sure, so i do get episodes of stabbing pain but they are not related to meals. Once the wave comes it lasts for only a minute or so."
800,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me when exactly you noted it?
800,GENHX,patient,"Approximately six months back. I took over the counter antacids and got some relief so i did not go to doctor. But two months back it got worse, I do get occasional nausea and vomiting."
800,GENHX,doctor,I can see that they found H pylori positive infection and treated you with triple drug therapy for two weeks and then gave you antacid omeprazole. But it did not improve your pain.
800,GENHX,patient,Yeah that's right.
800,GENHX,patient,Do you know I lost twenty pound of weight since all these symptoms began but i have been also admitted for poor appetite.
800,GENHX,doctor,Ok tell me how are your bowel movements and if you see any blood in stools?
800,GENHX,patient,I get two to three loose bowel movements a day but no blood in stool or anywhere.
800,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking any pain medication over the counter? Do you drink alcohol and maybe you are vomiting blood?
800,GENHX,patient,"No no, nothing like that."
800,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me if any change in position changes the quality of pain? do you have any fever?
800,GENHX,patient,"No position changing have no effect, no fever or anything."
800,GENHX,doctor,Have you been exercising before all this?
800,GENHX,patient,Yes I have had very active and healthy lifestyle.

806,PLAN,doctor,Ha! Not so old okay!
806,PLAN,patient,I had vomiting episodes and I am feeling very nauseous.
806,PLAN,doctor,Oh I am so sorry to hear that.
806,PLAN,patient,"I have pain in urination too, I think I might have the U T I?"

807,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
808,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, how old are you?"
808,GENHX,patient,"Hello Doctor, I'm fifty four years old."
808,GENHX,doctor,What gender do you identify with?

808,GENHX,patient,I have numbness and tingling in my right hand.
808,GENHX,doctor,Are there any specific fingers that you feel it in?
808,GENHX,patient,"I really feel it in my fifth, fourth, and third fingers."
808,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments have you done for this pain?
808,GENHX,patient,"I've taken antiinflammatories, stayed away from sports and stuff like that, and rested."
808,GENHX,doctor,Has this helped at all?
808,GENHX,patient,"No, not at all, its still numb and tingling."
808,GENHX,doctor,"This sounds like carpal tunnel, there's a quick, minimally invasive surgery I can do on this hand, since it hasn't responded to nonoperative treatments. I think that'll really help."
808,GENHX,patient,"I'd like to do that, what's the name of the procedure?"
808,GENHX,doctor,Its called a carpal tunnel release.
809,ROS,doctor,"Oh, how long?"
809,ROS,doctor,Okay.
809,ROS,doctor,How about fever nausea vomiting diarrhea?
809,ROS,doctor,Okay great.
810,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do? Are you working or in school?
810,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am in school.
810,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Good.
810,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thanks.
811,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have any children, ma'am?"
811,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have a wonderful baby girl at home."
811,GENHX,doctor,"Wonderful, were there any complications with your pregnancy or delivery?"
811,GENHX,patient,"Nope, everything went very smooth. I'm thankful."
811,GENHX,doctor,"Good, have you ever been hospitalized for any issue?"
811,GENHX,patient,"No, thankfully."
811,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so I can assume you've never had surgery?"
811,GENHX,patient,"Correct, I never have."
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Any past surgeries that I should know of?
812,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a hip replacement years ago.
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Both hips?
812,PASTSURGICAL,patient,My left.
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Total?
812,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yeah.
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Got it.
812,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I also had my uterus and appendix removed. I was young when I had my appendix taken out.
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you happen to remember who did your most recent surgeries?
812,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Wish I did. I'd have to look back at my records and get back to you. I have everything at home.
812,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"That's no problem. I should be able to look it up from my end, too."
813,ROS,doctor,Where do you live?
813,ROS,patient,I live with my mother around the corner where the Whole Foods is. I have been there for a few years now.
813,ROS,doctor,Are you the mother of the patient?
813,ROS,doctor,How are you dealing with everything?
814,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you taking any medications?
814,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I am taking Accutane for my acne issues."

814,MEDICATIONS,patient,"No, just that."
814,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay.
815,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Do you have any history of surgeries, sir?"
815,PASTSURGICAL,patient,The most recent was seven years ago. I had a craniotomy. I had a brain hemorrhage and there was bleed inside and outside the brain that they had to fix.
815,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,How was the recovery for that?
815,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I took a while but the doctors said I had a normal recovery time.
815,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,That is good. Have you had any other surgeries?
815,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had surgery on my leg for a fracture. They put some pins in my leg.
815,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay.
815,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had some kind of surgery done on my stomach when I was a kid. I am not sure what the surgery was. All I know is that it was a very common procedure with no complications.
815,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay. Is that all?
815,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yep. That's it.
816,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any past medical problems that I should know about?
816,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, what exactly do you mean by that, doctor?"
816,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Well, it could be anything from A D H D to depression to epilepsy."
816,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, no. I don't have anything like that."
817,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, lets talk about your family, anybody in your family have any neurological problems?"
817,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't think so, my parents did experience some memory loss but that was when they were in their nineties. And I am assuming it was mostly from the old age rather than any neuro problem."
817,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yeah, that is true. And how about your brothers and sisters, do you have any?"
817,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh yeah, I have five siblings and they are pretty healthy! I mean all of them are doing good, no one has any memory issues as far as I know or any neuro related illness."
817,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
818,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any family history of heart disease?
818,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mother has coronary artery disease.
819,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss X Y Z. Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions."
819,GENHX,patient,Sounds good to me.
819,GENHX,patient,I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters.
819,GENHX,doctor,"Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct?"
819,GENHX,patient,That's correct.
819,GENHX,doctor,"Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses?"
819,GENHX,patient,Sounds about right.
819,GENHX,doctor,"I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X?"
819,GENHX,patient,He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.
819,GENHX,doctor,"I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct?"
819,GENHX,patient,That's correct.
819,GENHX,doctor,"Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in?"
819,GENHX,doctor,What does the C T myelogram say?
819,GENHX,doctor,I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say?
819,GENHX,doctor,I see. Could you review the M R I film as well?
819,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today?"
819,GENHX,patient,I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip.
819,GENHX,doctor,What kind of pain are you feeling?
819,GENHX,patient,I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know.
819,GENHX,doctor,I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities?
819,GENHX,patient,Yes. When I walk and stand.
819,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to walk at all?
819,GENHX,patient,I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak.
819,GENHX,doctor,When does it feel better?
819,GENHX,patient,"I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage."
819,GENHX,doctor,"From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average?"
819,GENHX,patient,I'd say like a nine.
819,GENHX,doctor,"That's the intensity on a daily level, correct?"
819,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct."
819,GENHX,doctor,What's the lowest pain you've ever felt?
819,GENHX,patient,I think it was a five.
819,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function?"
819,GENHX,doctor,Great. Have you taken any medication recently?
819,GENHX,patient,Uh. I think it starts with a T.
819,GENHX,patient,That's correct.
820,PLAN,patient,"Um, do I have to follow some special or soft diet?"
820,PLAN,doctor,"No, nothing like that. You can have a normal diet. Whatever you like to eat."
820,PLAN,patient,"At this age, my diet is very limited. I am going to be eighty-two next month."
820,PLAN,doctor,"Well, I don't think you need to restrict your diet. You can follow your regular diet."
820,PLAN,patient,"Alright, thank you."
821,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do migraine headaches run in the family?
821,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mother gets migraines and she told me that it runs on her side of the family.
821,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any family history of blood clots?
821,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
822,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
822,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was, but my husband died thirty years ago."
822,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you working?
822,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
822,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your highest degree?
822,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I did high school. I was living alone for fifteen years until December of ninety four.
822,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How is your living situation now? Who is taking care of you?
822,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My daughters have started taking care of me on a shareable basis.
822,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke? Or drink or have ever used any drugs.
822,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
823,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?"
823,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I quit two years ago. But before that I used to smoke two packs per day. I first started smoking as a teenager."
823,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink at all?
823,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I used to drink six packs of beer plus two additional drinks a day for many years. Good news is that I've been dry for two years now.
823,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Any illicit drug use, such as cocaine, marijuana or heroin?"
823,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No none of that.
824,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. How are you doing today? It looks like we are evaluating C O P D and emphysema."
824,GENHX,patient,"Yes, the last time I was seen in Pulmonary Medicine Clinic was March two thousand and four."
824,GENHX,doctor,It has been quite some time. How are you feeling?
824,GENHX,patient,I have actually been hospitalized for psychiatric problems and now live in a nursing facility. Things have not been too great. I don't like living there.
824,GENHX,doctor,I understand the frustration. When you live in a nursing facility you lose a lot of your freedom.
824,GENHX,patient,"I want to live back in my apartment, but I know I am too ill to care for myself."
824,GENHX,doctor,In spite of all of that how are your respiratory issues?
824,GENHX,patient,"I feel pretty stable. I still have shortness of breath when I do activities, but with my condition I feel like that is something I will have to live with."
824,GENHX,doctor,"Unfortunately, that is the nature of the disease. I am happy to see that the pulmonary disease has not changed significantly since your last visit."
824,GENHX,patient,The only thing that seems to have changed is that I have a small cough and produce some mucus.
824,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Do you have any fever or chills?
824,GENHX,patient,"No, none of that."
824,GENHX,doctor,Do you experience any chest pains? I want to check especially since you have been coughing up some mucus.
824,GENHX,patient,"No, I luckily do not have any chest pains."
825,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"You can continue working, I just want you to be careful."
825,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thanks Doctor. I will be.
825,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great.
826,GENHX,doctor,"Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am?"
826,GENHX,patient,"Sure, I'm fifty six years old."
826,GENHX,doctor,"Great, so what brings you in to see me today?"
826,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'm peeing a lot, and I'm having  a little bit blood in that urine as well."
826,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had a cystoscopy?
826,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it was unremarkable, that's what they told me."
826,GENHX,doctor,When are your episodes for the most part?
826,GENHX,patient,"Um, usually during the day. I don't usually have them at night."
826,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any pain with urination?
826,GENHX,patient,"No, no pain."
826,GENHX,doctor,"Aside from the little bit of blood, can you tell if there's any pus in your urine?"
826,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't have any of that, it's just the little bit of blood."
826,GENHX,doctor,Have you taken any medications for this?
826,GENHX,patient,"Um, I had Ditropan, and it didn't do very well."
826,GENHX,doctor,"Well, this ultrasound of the kidney is also unremarkable, so at this time I think we should try a different medication."
827,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any health issues on your mom or dad's side?
827,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, we're a pretty healthy family."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Hello sir, how are you?"
828,GENHX,patient,"I don't know, I don't know whether I am good, or my problem is getting worse and that is the reason I got myself to your clinic for a neurological consult."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, don't worry! We will take care of you, let me start by taking some details."
828,GENHX,patient,Sure!
828,GENHX,doctor,So were you referred by someone or-
828,GENHX,patient,"Oh, no I referred myself to your clinic."
828,GENHX,doctor,Okay. And what is your age?
828,GENHX,patient,I am sixty four years young!
828,GENHX,doctor,"Ah, that's clever, you certainly look very young. And which is your dominant hand? Are you left handed, or right?"
828,GENHX,patient,I am right handed.
828,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what is going on with you?"
828,GENHX,patient,"Well, lately I am having difficulty remembering names and phone numbers or even events."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Well, it's not uncommon."
828,GENHX,patient,"I know, but I am usually very good at remembering things. I would have not worried that much, but it was brought to my attention by my clerical staff."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, okay. What do you do?"
828,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was the catholic priest at my parish, like we have our own small administrative district and church."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and when did you notice first that you are forgetting things?"
828,GENHX,patient,Around twelve months back.
828,GENHX,doctor,And did it cause any problem at work or any mishaps?
828,GENHX,patient,"No, not at all! No social or professional faux pas whatsoever."
828,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I have my notes let me put the date, oh what is the date-"
828,GENHX,patient,It's twenty eighth of February.
828,GENHX,doctor,Thank you!
829,DISPOSITION,doctor,"All right, you can go home now."
829,DISPOSITION,patient,Thank you doctor.
829,DISPOSITION,doctor,You can stay at your friend's place and make sure to take good care of yourself.
829,DISPOSITION,patient,Yes.
829,DISPOSITION,doctor,Make sure you follow up with Doctor X on Monday or Tuesday. I know that Doctor Y already discussed his plans. Continue taking your medicines except Prozac. Okay?
830,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
830,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope, I've never touched a cigarette nor do I plan on ever doing so. Same goes for alcohol."
831,GENHX,doctor,"Hi there! Welcome to the Neurology clinic, sir."
831,GENHX,patient,Hi! Thank you.
831,GENHX,doctor,What brings you in to the clinic today?
831,GENHX,patient,I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago.
831,GENHX,doctor,What did you notice as far as symptoms?
831,GENHX,patient,"Suddenly, I started having double vision."
831,GENHX,doctor,Did the double vision happen more than one time?
831,GENHX,patient,It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day.
831,GENHX,doctor,How long do the episodes last?
831,GENHX,patient,They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now.
831,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia?
831,GENHX,patient,No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case.
831,GENHX,doctor,What eyelid was drooping?
831,GENHX,patient,I don't remember?
831,GENHX,doctor,What is your dominate hand?
831,GENHX,patient,I am right handed.
831,GENHX,doctor,And how old are you?
831,GENHX,patient,I am sixty seven.
831,GENHX,doctor,"Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects?"
831,GENHX,patient,Yes.
831,GENHX,doctor,When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?
831,GENHX,patient,Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.
831,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues?
831,GENHX,patient,No.
832,GENHX,doctor,How old is your son?
832,GENHX,doctor,What seems to be the problem?
832,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let me see, okay, um, he has rocker bottom feet."
832,GENHX,doctor,"I believe he would benefit from a subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and lengthening of the Achilles. I'll go over the details of that procedure right now."
832,GENHX,doctor,Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.
832,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent."
832,GENHX,doctor,We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk.
832,GENHX,doctor,"No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent."
832,GENHX,doctor,"The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low."
833,GENHX,doctor,Welcome back to the clinic.
833,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
833,GENHX,doctor,I understand that we are doing an impairment rating exam today.
833,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
833,GENHX,doctor,And we are evaluating your right shoulder injury. Correct?
833,GENHX,patient,Yes.
833,GENHX,doctor,Was this a workrelated injury?
833,GENHX,patient,Yes. I was working as a C N A at the Veteran's House.
833,GENHX,doctor,How did the work injury happen?
833,GENHX,patient,"I was transferring a patient from a wheal chair to a bed, and I hurt my shoulder."
833,GENHX,doctor,What is the date of the incident?
833,GENHX,patient,"January first, two thousand and two."
833,GENHX,doctor,Are you currently working?
833,GENHX,patient,No. I have not been able to go back to work yet.
833,GENHX,doctor,"I am required to ask some specific questions for the L and I paperwork. What is your ago, ethnicity and gender?"
833,GENHX,patient,"I am a thirty one year old, white, female."
833,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had a prior injury to your right shoulder?
833,GENHX,patient,No.
833,GENHX,doctor,Are right or left hand dominant?
833,GENHX,patient,Right.
833,GENHX,doctor,"Other then your shoulder injury, do you have any other chronic health problems?"
833,GENHX,patient,No.
833,GENHX,doctor,"Are you experiencing any fever, chills or illnesses?"
833,GENHX,patient,No.
833,GENHX,doctor,Let discuss some of the previous treatments and test that you have been done for your shoulder.
833,GENHX,patient,Okey. I have done a lot of different treatments.
833,GENHX,doctor,What treatments have you done?
833,GENHX,patient,"I tried physical therapy. They did a subacromion decompression treatment in November, two thousand and two."
833,GENHX,doctor,Did either of those treatments help?
833,GENHX,patient,Not much. I went and saw Doctor Lin and he said that I might have a nerve fiber injury. I forget what he called it.
833,GENHX,doctor,Brachial plexopathy?
833,GENHX,patient,Yes. That sounds right.
833,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results."
833,GENHX,patient,Okey. They should be in my chart. I had Doctor Lin send over all my records.
833,GENHX,doctor,"Here it is. It says that the right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on December eighteenth, two thousand and three."
833,GENHX,patient,Whatever that means? I ended up getting a nerve block because I was still in pain. Doctor Lin did one in the frount of my shoulder and then another in the back.
833,GENHX,doctor,This has been a long drawn out course of treatments for you.
833,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it has been."
834,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,Are you up to date on your vaccines?
834,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,I've actually never been vaccinated before. My parents don't believe in vaccines.
835,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Hi there! Welcome in, sir."
835,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Hi! Thank you.
835,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What is your past medical history?
835,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No. I don't have any health problems.
835,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have a primary care doctor?
835,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No. I don't have health insurance right now.
836,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, ma'am?"
836,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
836,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you smoke, use alcohol or use recreational drugs?"
836,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
837,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"In the past I was very very fat! Actually, I was morbidly obese. I also had high blood pressure, but after my surgery it got resolved."
837,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, everything is okay now?"
837,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yeah.
838,GENHX,doctor,"So, you were referred by Doctor X."
838,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
838,GENHX,doctor,"According to him, I see no changes or correction to your present illness, right?"
838,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I think so."
839,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any related family history?
839,FAM/SOCHX,patient,You mean like heart issues in the family?
839,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yeah, something like that."
839,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My brother died of heart attack. It was sudden everyone was shocked.
839,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How old was he?
839,FAM/SOCHX,patient,He was not that old; he was just in his fifties.
840,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what's going on? What brings you to the emergency?"
840,GENHX,patient,I felt like my heart will explode. I have never felt palpitations like this. I am feeling so weak.
840,GENHX,doctor,When did it start?
840,GENHX,patient,This afternoon.
840,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, so your blood pressure is one ninety five by eighty three and your heart rate is one twenty one which is quite high."
840,GENHX,doctor,We have started you on I V Metoprolol. This will help to bring your heartrate down.
840,GENHX,doctor,And you said you are sixty six?
840,GENHX,patient,Yes.
840,GENHX,doctor,I can tell from her reports. Her blood pressure is quite high.
840,GENHX,doctor,"Well, that's not good!"
840,GENHX,doctor,And does she drink and smoke?
840,GENHX,doctor,How much do you drink Ma'am? Is it occasional?
840,GENHX,patient,"Well, I drink about four to five glasses of wine every day. I drank last night."
840,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I think you need to cut down on it."
840,GENHX,patient,I am trying doctor and honestly these are all withdrawal symptoms. I have never felt like this before.
840,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, I understand. For now I have put you on five M G of Metoprolol and looks like your blood pressure is under control and your heart rate has come down to seventy."
841,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, how are you today?"
841,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am here for a breast cancer screening.
841,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Have you gotten a mammogram before?
841,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have. I also try to keep up with my self examinations every few weeks."
841,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is great. I am happy to see you on top of your preventative healthcare.
841,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I try to be as careful as I can since my sister had breast cancer.
842,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir."
842,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor."
842,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, what seems to be the problem today, sir?"
842,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Well, I've had toe problems in the past."

842,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Actually, yes, I've had left knee issues in the past, too."
843,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Do you have a history of any health conditions that I should be aware of, ma'am?"
843,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um, yeah, I had a mastectomy, and chest tube placement."
843,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. Do you have any chronic conditions?"
843,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, I have chronic A F I B."
844,GENHX,doctor,"How have you been handing erectile dysfunction since your last visit, sir?"

844,GENHX,patient,"Well, they're firm now, and I can penetrate again for about ten minutes."
844,GENHX,doctor,"Good, are you having any chest pain?"
844,GENHX,patient,"No sir, I stopped using my nitroglycerin too."
844,GENHX,doctor,"Good, are you having any fever or chills?"
844,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that."
844,GENHX,doctor,"Are you having any pain with urination, or blood in the urine?"

844,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, I see here on Doctor X's notes that there were two specimens that were too small to evaluate."
845,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I am afraid, I don't have better news for you, your reports confirm cancer."
845,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"We were suspecting it all along, but now since it is confirmed it's just hard to accept."
845,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I am sorry, I totally understand. Do you want some time?"
845,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I am okay."

856,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No changes.
857,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. Looks like we are here for a general wellness check?"
857,GENHX,patient,"Yes, sir. In my seventy eight years on this Earth, I have learned to take my health more seriously. I need to start catching things before they come, not after."
857,GENHX,doctor,"I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?"
857,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery."
857,GENHX,doctor,What do you do with your new body?
857,GENHX,patient,I travel every chance I get. I just got back from a cruise.
857,GENHX,doctor,"I hope to be as agile as you when I get to retirement. Now let's check the other systems. Do you feel any type of chest pain? Any heaviness, tightness or pressure?"
857,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that."
857,GENHX,doctor,How about shortness of breath?
857,GENHX,patient,I only get short of breath when I walk up the stairs.
857,GENHX,doctor,That is decently normal. I get out of breath when walking from floor to floor in this hospital too.
857,GENHX,patient,I thought so. I remember being young and still struggling with stairs.
857,GENHX,doctor,"Unfortunately, some things are just with us for life. Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?"
857,GENHX,patient,No.
857,GENHX,doctor,Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?
857,GENHX,patient,Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that.
857,GENHX,doctor,Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?
857,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart."
857,GENHX,doctor,"You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?"
857,GENHX,patient,"Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling."
858,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,And when did you had your last tetanus shot?
858,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,"Um, I don't remember correctly, but it should be in my reports. I did have one sometime back, just don't remember when exactly."
858,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,"Ah, no problem. I see it here in your reports and it's up to date. So that's good."
858,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,Cool.
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,So where do you stay?
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I stay nearby in my apartment.
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Alone?
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I stay with my boyfriend."
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, and do you smoke and drink?"
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Both.
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And how much would say you smoke per day?
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I smoke a lot. Seven to eight packs per day."
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Oh! And for how many years?
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I don't remember exactly but for many, many years, I have a long history of chain smoking."
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hm. And alcohol?
859,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Same, I drink heavily. I have been drinking for many years."
859,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hm.
860,GENHX,doctor,"How are you, sir?"
860,GENHX,patient,One less than sixty.
860,GENHX,doctor,"So, what happened?"
860,GENHX,patient,"I was visiting my son in Cheyenne, Wyoming, then I on October tenth when I was taking a shower, I felt a pop in my head. I don't know what happened after that."
860,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, his report says he got a hemorrhage, I mean, blood clot in his brain."
861,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Is this your first surgery or have you had other surgeries in the past?
861,PASTSURGICAL,patient,This will be my second. I had a hernia repair back in O ten.
862,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Where do you work?
862,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I work at the Hilton as a head chef.
862,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or consume any form of tobacco?
862,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
862,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink or have ever used any illegal drug?
862,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, none of that."
863,ROS,doctor,Where do you feel the most pain?
863,ROS,patient,I'd have to say at the heels of my feet. I spend a lot of time on my feet at work.
863,ROS,doctor,I see. What kind of shoes do you normally wear to work?
863,ROS,patient,Regular tennis shoes.
863,ROS,doctor,Are they cushioned?
863,ROS,patient,"Eh not really, but they're pretty durable."
863,ROS,doctor,"I'd advise getting an orthotic for your shoes to help with the heel pain and resting your feet when you're home. In the meantime, I'd like for you to see a specialist to make sure nothing else is going on."
863,ROS,patient,"Alright, I'm good with that plan."
863,ROS,doctor,"Are you having any other problems? Joint pain, difficulty walking, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms?"
863,ROS,patient,"No, just heel pain for now."
864,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'm here to take your social history. So, tell me about yourself."
864,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was taking drugs. I tried all the methods, mainly I was using inhalation and I V drugs."
864,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Right now, you are on methadone, right?"
864,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I'm also going to the psychiatry department for my depression and these drug issues.
864,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your living status?
864,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I live with my roommate.
865,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I will ask you a few questions about your family history, sir."
865,FAM/SOCHX,patient,That's okay.
865,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does anyone in your family ever have any medical problems?
865,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Both of my parents had diabetes.
866,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you aware of any medical issues in your family?
866,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't know.
866,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your paternal family?
866,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't know my father. No idea about his family.
866,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your mom?  Maternal family?
866,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have no idea. I'm not in contact with her.
867,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir. Before we begin, how old are you?"
867,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. I'm forty one."
867,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, and how long have you had this left knee pain?"
867,GENHX,patient,It's been about two years now.
867,GENHX,doctor,Is there an injury?
867,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I sprained my MCL while playing hockey back then."
867,GENHX,doctor,What kind of symptoms have you had in this knee since then?
867,GENHX,patient,"Well, the knee locks up on me, I can't extend it all the way, and it just hurts really bad if I try to."
867,GENHX,doctor,Do you feel any instability?
867,GENHX,patient,"No, not at all."
868,GENHX,doctor,I see here that you've been feeling more short of breath.
868,GENHX,patient,"Yes, for three days now."
868,GENHX,doctor,Is it worse when you exert yourself?
868,GENHX,patient,"Um no, not really. I've had a terrible cough along with frequent headaches and chest congestion. I have also had a low fever."
868,GENHX,doctor,Did these symptoms start around the same time?
868,GENHX,patient,I think so.
868,GENHX,doctor,Where does your chest feel most congested? And how would you rate the pain right now? Ten being the worst.
868,GENHX,patient,Both sides. I'd say it's at a three currently.
868,GENHX,doctor,Does it send pain or numbness or tingling down your arms? How about any jaw pain as a result?
868,GENHX,patient,"No, but it does get worse whenever I cough."
868,GENHX,doctor,Is this your first time experiencing this type of congestion?
868,GENHX,patient,Oh no. I had something like it about ten months ago.
868,GENHX,doctor,Did that improve on its own?
868,GENHX,patient,"It would come and go, but over the past few days it's gotten worse. I am a strong German man so I held out coming to the doctor as long as I could."
868,GENHX,doctor,"You are very strong! You are sixty nine though, so I don't think anyone would see it as weak if you came to the doctor more often."
869,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you aware of any medical problems in your family?
869,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
869,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anyone with any heart disease or diabetes?
869,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
870,ROS,doctor,"Besides pain in your left eye, are you having any other problems?"
870,ROS,patient,No.
870,ROS,doctor,Do you happen to have a history of eye problems?
870,ROS,patient,None.
871,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today."
871,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea."
871,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?"
871,GENHX,patient,"It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on."
871,GENHX,doctor,So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?
871,GENHX,patient,Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still.
871,GENHX,doctor,That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of.
871,GENHX,patient,Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring.
871,GENHX,doctor,How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?
871,GENHX,patient,"I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare."
871,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy."
872,CC,doctor,How are you feeling today?
872,CC,patient,I have a lot of anxiety.
872,CC,doctor,Anything else?
872,CC,patient,I have a lot of pain in my chest as well.
872,CC,doctor,Do you drink?
872,CC,patient,"Yes, I cannot stop myself. I have tried many times but it's hard to control."
873,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you smoke?"
873,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
873,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about alcohol?
873,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I drink, but just normal. I don't have any alcohol problem."
873,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay. So, no history of any drug or alcohol abuse, right?"
873,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, not at all."
873,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
874,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, how can I help you?"
874,GENHX,patient,I am here for a follow up on my heart rhythm problem. I think it is atrial fibrillation.
874,GENHX,doctor,Oh yes. You are not on Cardizem and your heart rate is up just a little bit today.
874,GENHX,patient,That's right. I misplaced it.
874,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Let me see. What symptoms are you experiencing right now?
874,GENHX,patient,I am feeling very dizzy. I do have some vertigo and lightheadedness.
874,GENHX,doctor,"You are on blood thinners, right? That is Coumadin therapy? Or am I wrong here?"
874,GENHX,patient,"No, you are right but please stop the Coumadin. I am tired of these regular blood draws."
874,GENHX,doctor,"See, I understand it is hard to control it. It is difficult to regulate that."
874,GENHX,patient,Yes exactly. That is why I don't want it. Give me something simple.
874,GENHX,doctor,Okay I will investigate it. Are you experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
874,GENHX,patient,"Oh no, I am not feeling that."
874,GENHX,doctor,Okay great!
874,GENHX,patient,"Actually, I am moving around a little bit better now and my arm does not hurt."
874,GENHX,doctor,How about your back pain?
874,GENHX,patient,"Um, it is improving as well."
874,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, cool."
874,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
875,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, young man."
875,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Who is this young lady, is this your grandmother, or sister?"
875,GENHX,doctor,"Good, my chart says that you're fourteen years old. Is that correct?"
875,GENHX,patient,Yes sir.
875,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so what seems to be the problem today?"
875,GENHX,patient,I've been having pain in this knee for about a month now.
875,GENHX,doctor,Can you remember a specific injury to this knee?
875,GENHX,patient,"Um, yeah, I was playing basketball when I jumped, and then when I landed I felt this knee pop."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Do you remember the date of your injury, young man?"
875,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so how have you been treated for this so far?"
875,GENHX,patient,"We went to another clinic first, and they put me in a splint."
875,GENHX,doctor,Have they taken x rays yet?
875,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I got back a few minutes ago."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg."
875,GENHX,patient,"What, where? Can you show me?"
875,GENHX,doctor,"Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this."
875,GENHX,doctor,"It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection."
875,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, he won't feel a thing."
875,GENHX,doctor,"We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen."
876,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
876,GENHX,patient,"Sure, good afternoon, doctor. I'm sixty one years old."
876,GENHX,doctor,"Great, what brings you in for a visit today?"
876,GENHX,patient,"I have some notes here with me, but I have a history of polyarteritis nodosa mononeuritis multiplex."
876,GENHX,doctor,"Is this in your legs, or arms?"
876,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's in my legs."
876,GENHX,doctor,I see here that you have sleep apnea too.
876,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I was involved in an overnight sleep study on C P A P and oxygen."
876,GENHX,doctor,Why did they do this?
876,GENHX,patient,It was in order to determine why I had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
876,GENHX,doctor,Have You had any other treatments?
876,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I had a review done while I was in the hospital about two weeks ago, I have the results right here."
876,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so, how is your leg pain been managed?"
876,GENHX,patient,"Um, I take pretty substantial doses of opioids in order to control it."
876,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any swelling?
876,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I take Lasix for my leg swelling."
876,GENHX,doctor,How do you sleep with the C P A P?
876,GENHX,patient,"I can fall asleep with it, but I usually rip my mask off because I toss and turn."
876,GENHX,doctor,How would you rate your quality of sleep?
876,GENHX,patient,"I'd, um, say it's pretty terrible."
877,GENHX,doctor,"Hi there, what's going on?"
877,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, you did the right thing. Ma'am, how are you feeling?"
877,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, okay.How old is she?"
877,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I see. She has expressive aphasia, correct?"
877,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let me check her. She does have a droop to her right side of the face. Ma'am, do you feel any weakness on the right side of your body?"
877,GENHX,doctor,She had her C T scan earlier today and I have the report. It does not show any acute attack or anything.
877,GENHX,doctor,But it does show that she has a new onset of a stroke.
877,GENHX,doctor,I think we need to admit her for observation. We need to monitor her. We will also get her a proper treatment for her urinary infection which is not getting better due to resistance to the oral medicines.
877,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, let me talk to the nurse."
878,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, are you translating for the patient today? I am sorry, but I do not speak Spanish."
878,GENHX,doctor,"My chart says this man is fifty two years old, is all of that correct?"
878,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so, what seems to be the problem today?"
878,GENHX,doctor,"Oh no, when was this?"
878,GENHX,doctor,Which knee did he injure?
878,GENHX,doctor,How has he been treated for this so far?
878,GENHX,doctor,What did the P C P recommend?
879,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
879,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I smoke about three packs in a month.
879,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
879,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
879,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for work?
879,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am an editorial assistant at the local newspaper.
880,ALLERGY,doctor,Have you had any adverse reactions to medications you've taken in the past?
880,ALLERGY,patient,"No, thankfully."
881,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you okay?
881,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, yeah, I am fine."
881,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I am asking this as you look a little pale.
881,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No I am okay. I have always been healthy my whole life. Just a little fatigued now.
881,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay that won't be something we can't fix.
881,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, but I am okay."
881,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yes, I do not see any issues with your past history."
881,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"As I said, I am healthy."
882,GENHX,doctor,"Hello today I have my assistant with me, and she will be representing your case. Tell me who do we have today?"
882,GENHX,doctor,Did you go and see a psychiatrist?
882,GENHX,patient,I did. It was okay.
882,GENHX,doctor,What brings you here today?
882,GENHX,patient,"My headaches are back. They are very severe this time. It all happened that, after that scan."
882,GENHX,doctor,When did she have her scan?
882,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and after that I'm having these very bad headaches."
882,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to sleep in the night properly?
882,GENHX,patient,"No, these headaches wake me up in the night. I haven't had a proper sleep in like ages."
882,GENHX,doctor,Is there anything that elevates this pain? Or decreases it?
882,GENHX,patient,"Everything seems like increasing it. It just gets worse with coughing, straining, sneezing, even when I'm trying to stand. I tried all the medications, but nothing is helpful. There was Imitrex and I also tried Motrin eight hundred M G twice a day, but nothing seems to be like effective. Actually, it helps a bit when I lie down."
882,GENHX,doctor,Is it like specific to any particular area of your head?
882,GENHX,patient,"It is like all over but, uh, very much intense in the forehead."
882,GENHX,doctor,Is there any nausea associated with the headaches?
882,GENHX,patient,No.
882,GENHX,doctor,Anything else that happens along with these headaches?
882,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I get that ringing sound in my ears, and I just don't feel well."
882,GENHX,doctor,Any changes in your vision?
882,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it gets blurry, and I feel like lights are dimming. I will be meeting Doctor Y tomorrow."
882,GENHX,doctor,Any other thing you want to add?
882,GENHX,patient,"No, that's it."
883,ALLERGY,doctor,Tell me about the medical issues you had in the past or still do.
883,ALLERGY,patient,"Well, I have asthma, sinus. I also have hives and there is a history of psoriasis."
883,ALLERGY,doctor,"Wow, okay. Any known allergies?"
883,ALLERGY,patient,Nothing that I have known.
884,ALLERGY,doctor,Any known allergies?
884,ALLERGY,patient,No.
885,GENHX,doctor,"Hello there, how are you doing?"
885,GENHX,patient,"Sorry, I'm just not feeling well. Something is wrong."
885,GENHX,doctor,"Don't worry, I will check you up. We will figure it out. Do you remember when you had your last physical?"
885,GENHX,patient,It was sometime in early May in two thousand and eight.
885,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I'm going through your chart. It looks like you have not been feeling well for about two weeks now."
885,GENHX,patient,That's right.
885,GENHX,doctor,Tell me what is happening exactly.
885,GENHX,patient,"In the beginning I was thinking that it was just the stress and anxiety, but then I become worried that it might be something really different or something bad."
885,GENHX,doctor,What are you experiencing exactly? What are your symptoms?
885,GENHX,patient,It started with a lot of palpitations at first. My heart was beating so fast it looks like it was ready to go out. I was having this fluttering feeling in my chest.
885,GENHX,doctor,Were you feeling tired or fatigued?
885,GENHX,patient,"Yes, very much for the last two weeks. I am worried it's my job. It is really getting to me."
885,GENHX,doctor,What else are you feeling?
885,GENHX,patient,Feeling very nervous an anxious actually.
885,GENHX,doctor,Have you noticed anything that you are doing or anything else that kind of increasing these symptoms?
885,GENHX,patient,"Oh yeah, whenever I'm stressed. I feel like I have more palpitations and to the level that it causes a lot of chest pain."
885,GENHX,doctor,Is it the same when you are doing a lot of physical stuff like physical activities or something like that?
885,GENHX,patient,Nope. Haven't noticed it with the exertion part.
885,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any history of any heart issues in the past?
885,GENHX,patient,I had the same kind of symptoms like nine or ten years ago.
885,GENHX,doctor,Okay. What did you do that time? How did you recover?
885,GENHX,patient,"Well, at that time a full work up was done but everything came out to be negative, so they just gave me something for my nerves. It kind of helped."
885,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember what they gave you? Like name or anything of the medicine.
885,GENHX,patient,"No. It was many years ago, I don't remember."
885,GENHX,doctor,Anything else going on?
885,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, for the last three days and I am having these tummy issues. I'm having on and off nausea and also, my stools are coming loose."
885,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen any color change in your bowel movements?
885,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it's been some really funny green color. I don't know what's going on inside."
885,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever noticed blood in the stools?
885,GENHX,patient,Nope.
885,GENHX,doctor,Is there any pain in your tummy?
885,GENHX,patient,"Nope, it's just some nausea."
885,GENHX,doctor,How's your appetite?
885,GENHX,patient,Not as good as before.
885,GENHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
885,GENHX,patient,I never did.
886,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"So just to double check, you're not on any medications?"
886,MEDICATIONS,patient,You got it. Nothing since last year.
887,ASSESSMENT,doctor,What brings you in today?
887,ASSESSMENT,patient,I have this nasty cough and my nose has been super stuffy.
887,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Are you bringing anything up when you cough?
887,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Not really, no."
887,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Are you having any other symptoms, such as chest pain, headaches, nausea, or vomiting?"
887,ASSESSMENT,patient,No. I did have a slight headache last night but I took Advil and it's since gotten better.
887,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Are you taking anything for the cough or stuffy nose?
887,ASSESSMENT,patient,Just drinking tea and taking cough drops here and there.
887,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Okay. Let's take a look at you. Hm it appears that you have a U R I.
888,GENHX,doctor,"How are you feeling today, sir?"
888,GENHX,patient,"I feel pretty weak right now, but I am doing okay at the moment."
888,GENHX,doctor,I reviewed the chart notes that was sent to me by the nursing home. They also sent me your medical history. You have been going through a lot recently.
888,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have. They moved me into the nursing home after I was released from the hospital. I hope that it is just temporary."
888,GENHX,doctor,I understand that you had a seizer and that is why you were taken to the hospital.
888,GENHX,patient,I had multiple seizures. After I was stabilized from the last seizure this side of my body in not working right.
888,GENHX,doctor,Okay so you are having some partial weakness on this side?
888,GENHX,patient,Yes. That is why they moved me to the nursing home. I can't stand up. I am too weak. I can't take care of myself. The nurses have to help me do everything.
888,GENHX,doctor,I am going to try to help you get back to doing things on your own.
888,GENHX,patient,After being in the hospital I got an infection in my intestines. They put me on some antibiotic that I have never heard of and a probiotic.
888,GENHX,doctor,Okay. I see here in the chart that you had two surgeries on July sixth.
888,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and then I had a radiation treatment too."
888,GENHX,doctor,Oh yes. On August seventh.
888,GENHX,patient,That sounds right.
888,GENHX,doctor,Your surgeries may have been the reason for the C diff.
888,GENHX,patient,What is C diff?
888,GENHX,doctor,"It is an infection in the large intestine. It is often caused by overuse of antibiotics, and you have been on them for a while due to the surgeries that you have had. Or it could be from the surgery itself."
888,GENHX,patient,That make since.
889,ROS,doctor,How is your sleep? Are you sleeping well?
889,ROS,patient,"Yes, without any disturbance. I sleep like a log!"
889,ROS,doctor,Good. Any mood swings or did you feel your emotions are out of control?
889,ROS,patient,"Nah, just the normal mood swings around my periods otherwise no problem at all."
889,ROS,doctor,"Any depression like feeling, sudden mood changes or feeling sad or hopeless?"
889,ROS,patient,Nope!
889,ROS,doctor,Okay.
890,ASSESSMENT,doctor,How's he doing today?
890,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Oh, wow. Let's see what we can do."
891,CC,patient,Help! I need help! I need to see the doctor!
891,CC,doctor,"Yes, what's wrong? Where's your pain?"
891,CC,patient,My stomach! It hurts so much! I've never had this type of pain before!
891,CC,doctor,When did it start?
891,CC,patient,At ten! I don't know. It started hurting out of nowhere. One second I'm driving home and the next thing I know I had to call-
891,CC,doctor,Yes?
891,CC,patient,The pain is so bad! It's hard for me to even think straight.
892,ROS,doctor,"Just want to ask you few routine questions, let me know if any of this is positive."
892,ROS,patient,"Sure, go ahead."
892,ROS,doctor,"Do you have any problems like headache, fever, rash, oral ulcer?"
892,ROS,patient,None.
892,ROS,doctor,Any problem with vision? Like unable to see or double vision?
892,ROS,patient,"Um no, I can see everything."
892,ROS,doctor,"Okay. Do you get palpitations, like are you aware of your own heart?"
892,ROS,patient,"No, nothing like that."
892,ROS,doctor,How about breathlessness while lying down or do you have to get up in the middle of the night to catch a breath?
892,ROS,patient,No I don't feel anything like that.
892,ROS,doctor,"That's great. Any diarrhea, constipation, or red blood come out in stool? Or pale stool? Like any change in the color of stool?"
892,ROS,patient,"No, it is fine."
892,ROS,doctor,Okay. Any jaundice recently?
892,ROS,patient,No. No jaundice.
892,ROS,doctor,Do you have problems with appetite?
892,ROS,patient,"Yeah, I mean you can say my appetite is decreased."
892,ROS,doctor,Because of that have you noticed any weight loss?
892,ROS,patient,Oh no.
892,ROS,doctor,Okay sounds good.
892,ROS,patient,Sure.
893,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. What seems to be the problem with your knee?"
893,GENHX,patient,I've had pain in this knee since I tripped on some ice on March tenth two thousand three.
893,GENHX,doctor,How old are you now?
893,GENHX,patient,I'm forty seven.
893,GENHX,doctor,What kind of symptoms have you had since the fall?
893,GENHX,patient,"It's hard for me to stand up without significant pain, and it feels like my knee is going to give way."
893,GENHX,doctor,Has this knee given out before?
893,GENHX,patient,It has.
893,GENHX,doctor,Is there any swelling in this knee?
893,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I also feel a popping, like when I go up the stairs."
893,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments have you had for this knee?
893,GENHX,patient,"I've had antiinflammatories and P T, but I didn't respond well at all."
893,GENHX,doctor,Have you had surgery on this knee in the past?
893,GENHX,patient,"Yes, but I can't remember the name of the operation."
894,GENHX,doctor,"How're you doing today, sir?"
894,GENHX,patient,Uh I'm hanging in there.
894,GENHX,doctor,I see that you've recently celebrated your seventy second birthday.
894,GENHX,patient,Yep. My kids and grandkids threw me a surprise party. It was really nice.
894,GENHX,doctor,"Aw surprises are always fun. However, I'm sorry to hear that you're not doing that well today."
894,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, me too. The other day, I had a lot of difficulty getting up from my chair because of weakness all over and a lightheadedness I can't seem to explain."
894,GENHX,doctor,Is this new for you?
894,GENHX,patient,"Um I mean I've had falling spells several times a month for the past year, but I've always been able to get myself up one way or another."
894,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember losing consciousness during any of those episodes?
894,GENHX,patient,Not that I recall. I've noticed I'm a lot weaker than before so maybe that's why I keep falling more frequently.
894,GENHX,doctor,I see. Do you experience room spinning dizziness at all?
894,GENHX,patient,"No. I also forgot to mention that four hours after not being able to get up from my chair, my left hand became numb for about two hours."
894,GENHX,doctor,Are you right or left handed?
894,GENHX,patient,Right handed.
894,GENHX,doctor,"And besides what you've mentioned to me so far, no other symptoms of concern?"
894,GENHX,patient,No.
895,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And where do you live?
895,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I live in this small town called Fayetteville in Tennessee."
895,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Ah, I see. And do you have lot of friends there?"
895,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have few.
895,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, and do you drink?"
895,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
895,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about smoking?
895,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Never did!
896,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling?
896,GENHX,patient,I am feeling better now.
896,GENHX,doctor,What happened last night?
896,GENHX,doctor,What did you take?
896,GENHX,patient,I took Ecstasy. I only had two drinks.
896,GENHX,doctor,How much Ecstasy did you take?
896,GENHX,patient,I didn't take them all at once. I think I took six tabs.
896,GENHX,doctor,What time did you start taking the tablets?
896,GENHX,patient,We started taking it kind of late. I think it was midnight.
896,GENHX,doctor,"Mom, did you notice any blood, or any yellow or green color in the vomit?"
896,GENHX,doctor,Are you still feeling nauseous?
896,GENHX,patient,"No. I feel fine. Well, I feel weird but not nauseous."
896,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing any pain at all?
896,GENHX,patient,No.
896,GENHX,doctor,Did you or do you feel depressed?
896,GENHX,patient,No.
896,GENHX,doctor,Do you or have you ever had suicidal thoughts?
896,GENHX,patient,No.
896,GENHX,doctor,Are you seeing or hearing things that are not real?
896,GENHX,patient,No.
896,GENHX,doctor,Do you or have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself?
896,GENHX,patient,No. I was not trying to harm myself or anyone else. I just wanted to have a little fun.
896,GENHX,doctor,Just one more question. Prior to last night have you had any recent illnesses or injuries?
896,GENHX,patient,No.
897,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you have any support system?
897,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, I am single."
897,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay so live alone at home?
897,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yes.
897,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
897,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Nope I do not.
898,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, are you married?"
898,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, my wife and I got divorced a while ago. We have three children together, though."
898,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, and do you have someone who is managing your case?"
898,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I have an lawyer handling everything."
898,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
898,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I never really smoke or drink."
899,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you ever had surgery?
899,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, not that I can remember."
899,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"No gallbladder or appendix removal, c sections, or joint replacements?"
899,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Nope, never had anything done."
900,GENHX,doctor,"I just need to confirm a few pieces of information from my nurse before we begin today, sir."
900,GENHX,patient,"Sure, no problem, doctor."
900,GENHX,doctor,"Great, so it says here that you are forty five years old, and you identify as Caucasian. Is that correct?"
900,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
900,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so, what seems to be the problem today?"
900,GENHX,patient,"Well, I have this pain in my right knee, sir."
900,GENHX,doctor,Where is your pain?
900,GENHX,patient,"It's right here, on the inside of my right knee."
900,GENHX,doctor,Is there an injury associated with this pain?
900,GENHX,patient,"Actually, yeah. I twisted it while I was at work."
901,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
901,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. I'm fifty nine years old."
901,GENHX,doctor,"Great, and which hand is your dominant hand?"
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, I use my right hand for everything."
901,GENHX,doctor,"Great, thank you. So, what seems to be the problem today?"
901,GENHX,patient,I have had this weird feeling in both of my legs for about three weeks now.
901,GENHX,doctor,Have you been treated for this so far?
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, I went to the E R about a week ago."
901,GENHX,doctor,What did they tell you there?
901,GENHX,patient,They said I had progressive sensory and motor deficits in both legs.
901,GENHX,doctor,"Can you describe your symptoms for me, please?"
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, I have numbness, like here starting at my trunk, and then over the last month or so, it moved into my legs."
901,GENHX,doctor,"I'm going to apply some pressure right here at the nipple line, can you feel that?"
901,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm numb from there down."
901,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any weakness in your legs?
901,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I have for the last week or so."
901,GENHX,doctor,Is it getting worse?
901,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it is."
901,GENHX,doctor,When did you start using the cane?
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, about five days ago, now."
901,GENHX,doctor,Why did you begin using it?
901,GENHX,patient,I'm having trouble walking and going up and down stairs.
901,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to stand without it?
901,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm not."
901,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any loss of bowel or bladder control?
901,GENHX,patient,"No, thankfully not, but at the same time I haven't had a bowel movement in about three days."
901,GENHX,doctor,When was the last time you urinated?
901,GENHX,patient,It was about twenty four hours ago.
901,GENHX,doctor,"In addition to the numbness, how else would you describe your leg symptoms?"
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'd say it feels cold, at least I've felt that for the last day or so."
901,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any back or neck pain?
901,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing there."
901,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any shortness of breath?
901,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've had it chronically for a while now, but I think it's getting worse."
901,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any lightheadedness or feelings of faint?
901,GENHX,patient,"Um, yeah, when I try to stand up."
901,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had that feeling?
901,GENHX,patient,I've had it for about two days now.
902,ALLERGY,doctor,Do you have any known allergies to medications?
902,ALLERGY,patient,No.
903,GENHX,doctor,"Good evening, and welcome to A B C D General Hospital E D."
903,GENHX,patient,"Thank you, Doctor, I've really messed up this ankle."
903,GENHX,doctor,"Before we begin, how old are you? And which gender do you identify?"
903,GENHX,patient,"Thank you for asking, Doctor, I'm a fifty year old man."
903,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, what happened?"
903,GENHX,patient,"I fell off my liner, and I landed right onto my left foot."
903,GENHX,doctor,How far did you fall?
903,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was really about ten feet."
903,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, yes, I see. I have some good news for you, there's no gross deformity in this ankle."
903,GENHX,patient,"What does that mean, exactly?"
903,GENHX,doctor,"I don't see any ankle dislocation, which is good."
903,GENHX,patient,"Oh, that's good news."
903,GENHX,doctor,Have you had your x rays taken yet?
903,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, the tech just brought me back."
903,GENHX,doctor,"Great, let me pull them up here. Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus."
903,GENHX,patient,Which bone is that?
903,GENHX,doctor,"That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region."
903,GENHX,patient,What are we going to do about this?
903,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?"
903,GENHX,patient,"No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall."
903,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle."
903,GENHX,patient,Why is that?
903,GENHX,doctor,"There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death."
903,GENHX,patient,"Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?"
903,GENHX,doctor,"Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean."
903,GENHX,patient,Will I be asleep for this?
903,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you'll be under anesthesia."
903,GENHX,patient,"Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery."
904,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What medications are you currently taking?
904,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Augmentin, Detroal LA and lisinopril."
905,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Did you ever have any surgery?
905,PASTSURGICAL,patient,No.
906,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. How are you doing today?"
906,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have this massive headache.
906,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. Do migraines usually run in your family?
906,FAM/SOCHX,patient,They do. Everyone has it. We've been having it for many years.
906,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. I'm looking at your blood reports, and it shows you have high blood sugar. Does diabetes run in your family too?"
906,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yup. We all eat too much rice for dinner.
907,GENHX,doctor,What's bringing you in today?
907,GENHX,patient,I've had a terrible toothache. I can't stand the pain anymore. I have never experienced this pain in fifty eight years.
907,GENHX,doctor,Where are you experiencing the most pain? And when did this pain start?
907,GENHX,patient,It started about three weeks ago. It's mostly on the left side of my mouth. Kind of on the lower end. It goes from my jaw all the way up to my left ear.
907,GENHX,doctor,That doesn't sound the least bit comfortable. Let's get you feeling better. Do you think it's related to your tooth?
907,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't think so. I'm pretty good at making my dentist appointments, although I haven't been in since this new pain started."
907,GENHX,doctor,I see. When was the last time you visited the dentist?
907,GENHX,patient,About two months ago for a routine clean.
907,GENHX,doctor,Have you noticed any facial swelling since all of this started?
907,GENHX,patient,"No, no swelling."
907,GENHX,doctor,"Any headaches, throat swelling, sore throat, difficulty swallowing or chewing?"
907,GENHX,patient,No.
907,GENHX,doctor,"How about any neck pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fever, or other symptoms?"
907,GENHX,patient,"No, thank goodness."
908,GENHX,doctor,"How long has your finger been in pain, sir?"
908,GENHX,patient,"Well, at this point, it's been more than a few months."
908,GENHX,doctor,Have you seen another doctor for this pain?
908,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I saw another guy a little while ago."
908,GENHX,doctor,Do you have the records from the visit?
908,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, actually, they're right here."
908,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so I see you have a trigger finger, and a mucous cyst, and this other doctor gave you injections. Is that correct?"
908,GENHX,patient,Yes sir.
908,GENHX,doctor,Did the injections help at all?
908,GENHX,patient,"No sir, honestly, they did nothing."
908,GENHX,doctor,"So, your finger is still locking today?"
908,GENHX,patient,"Yes sir, the other doctor referred me over here to see if there was anything more we could do. I'd like to try surgery."
909,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, I am Doctor James."
909,GENHX,doctor,"Nice to meet you ladies. So, Miya how old are you?"
909,GENHX,patient,I am fifteen.
909,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so tell me what is going on with you?"
909,GENHX,patient,"Well, I am having a severe headache."
909,GENHX,doctor,Oh wow. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is?
909,GENHX,patient,"Um, it started from my neck and then moved up to the back of my head."
909,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you get hurt or bump your head?
909,GENHX,patient,No.
909,GENHX,doctor,Does she have any history of headaches?
909,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, any nausea or vomiting?"
909,GENHX,patient,"I am having nausea, but it's coming and going but no vomiting. Also, I am not able to tolerate light at all."
909,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, are you able to see properly though, any change in your vision?"
909,GENHX,patient,No.
909,GENHX,doctor,Any fever?
909,GENHX,patient,No.
909,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
910,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And you said you're right handed, correct?"
910,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yep. Right handed.
910,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, great. I've made note of it in your chart. I have one more question to ask regarding tobacco and alcohol. Do you smoke or drink?"
910,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't do either. I can't even think of the last time I took a sip of alcohol.
911,CC,doctor,He's here for sepsis and I suspect he may have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
912,EXAM,doctor,"Let's check your throat. Okay, I don't see any swelling or any mass. Is there any pain when I touch you?"
912,EXAM,patient,No pain.
912,EXAM,doctor,I don't feel any kind of lump in your throat. That is a good sign. It looks very flexible and symmetric.
913,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
913,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, please, how old are you?"
913,GENHX,patient,"I'm sixty nine years old, doctor."
913,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?"
913,GENHX,patient,"Oh, I've had pain in these knees for years, but it's been getting a lot worse over the last few months."
913,GENHX,doctor,Is the pain messing with your ability to do activities?
913,GENHX,patient,"Absolutely, sir, yes it is."
913,GENHX,doctor,What kind of treatments have you had so far?
913,GENHX,patient,"Another doctor called it conservative treatment, um, I've taken antiinflammatories and had some injections."
913,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember what kind of injections you've had?
913,GENHX,patient,"It was, um, cortisone, and Synvisc."
913,GENHX,doctor,Did these relieve the pain at all?
913,GENHX,patient,"Well, it was only a temporary relief. Is there anything else we can do?"
913,GENHX,doctor,"Well, there is surgery for this."
913,GENHX,patient,What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
913,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, it's less than one percent."
913,GENHX,patient,How is this possible?
913,GENHX,doctor,We use prophylactic antibiotics in order to eliminate the risk.
913,GENHX,patient,"That's great, I've heard of D V T from the commercials, is there a risk for that?"
913,GENHX,doctor,"There's a risk, but it's low. Other risks are pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain."
913,GENHX,patient,"Okay, yes, I'd like to do the surgery."
914,GENHX,doctor,How's this little guy doing today?
914,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's have a look see."
914,GENHX,doctor,Did that seem to help?
914,GENHX,doctor,Has he been running any fevers?
914,GENHX,doctor,He sounds a bit congested.
914,GENHX,doctor,Is his cough productive?
914,GENHX,doctor,Does it seem to be keeping him up at night? How does the mucous look?
914,GENHX,doctor,And no shortness of breath or wheezing that you've noticed?
915,GENHX,doctor,"How are you feeling today, sir?"
915,GENHX,patient,"I'm doing much better today, doctor."
915,GENHX,doctor,How is your strength and muscular pain?
915,GENHX,patient,They're both improving.
915,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other complaints today?
915,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm doing quite well, honestly."
916,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"You have cholesterol issues, right?"
916,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
916,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay. I see. Gemfibrozil? That sounds familiar? Do you take that?
916,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I think that one. But I am not sure."
916,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay. Do you remember taking them at all as an outpatient?
916,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I mean I don't remember.
916,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay don't worry I can look at your previous records. We do have them.
917,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Are you taking any medicine?
917,MEDICATIONS,patient,No.
918,GENHX,doctor,So it looks like you're here today for a noticeable foreign body sensation in your eye.
918,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, my left eye. Never had this happen to me in my forty one years."
918,GENHX,doctor,First time for everything I guess! When did you first notice the sensation?
918,GENHX,patient,"Um when I was at work this morning. It felt like something was in my eye. I went to the bathroom mirror to check it out, but didn't see anything. I flushed my eyes with water in hopes of it helping with the weird feeling."
918,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. Hm, are you experiencing any eye pain, blurred vision, or sensitivity to light?"
918,GENHX,patient,The pain has definitely gotten worse since this morning. My vision is fine and bright lights don't seem to be a problem.
919,CC,doctor,What brings you in today?
919,CC,patient,I've had a lot of discomfort in my private area.
919,CC,doctor,When did it start?
919,CC,patient,It's been going on for about two weeks now.
919,CC,doctor,Have you noticed any abnormal discharge?
919,CC,patient,"Not really, no. But it's been super itchy down there."
919,CC,doctor,"Any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting?"
919,CC,patient,"Uh no, but I'm having some pain here."
919,CC,doctor,Near your pelvis?
919,CC,patient,Yeah.
919,CC,doctor,Have you started any new lotions or products?
919,CC,patient,No.
919,CC,doctor,Have you tried anything for the pain or itching?
919,CC,patient,"No, not yet. I thought it'd go away on it's own."
919,CC,doctor,"If it's okay with you, I'd like to do a pelvic exam."
919,CC,patient,Fine with me.
919,CC,doctor,Have you been sexually active prior to or after noticing these concerns?
919,CC,patient,"Uh once this past week, but it was pretty painful."
919,CC,doctor,"I see. You may have an infection, which is why I'd also like to send out samples to the lab. Did you use protection?"
919,CC,patient,"Yeah, I take birth control. But I've been struggling a bit with my mood and I'm wondering if it's because of the new birth control pills."
919,CC,doctor,We can look into that as well. Hang tight while I grab the nurse for the pelvic exam.
920,ALLERGY,doctor,Do you have any allergies?
920,ALLERGY,patient,"No, I do not have any allergies."
920,ALLERGY,doctor,Okay so no medically relevant allergies then. Nothing?
920,ALLERGY,patient,Nope.
921,PROCEDURES,doctor,I don't think we need to do any major procedure right now.
921,PROCEDURES,patient,Okay.
922,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Did you have any medical issues?
922,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
923,ALLERGY,doctor,Any known allergies?

925,GENHX,doctor,What happened to make you think that you had a stroke?
925,GENHX,patient,"This morning, I felt like something in my throat. It was a strange feeling. Then I felt really dizzy. My left hand and jaw felt numb."
925,GENHX,doctor,Did you lose consciousness?
925,GENHX,patient,I don't know. It is a bit confusing. I woke up this morning and I was so disoriented that I thought it was the middle of the night. My hand was numb. I also felt the numbness on the left side of my neck and my face.
925,GENHX,doctor,Did the dizzy episode happen after you woke up this morning?
925,GENHX,patient,Yes. I got dizzy when I tried to get out of bed.
925,GENHX,doctor,Has anything like this happen to you in the past?

925,GENHX,patient,No.

925,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any cold or any other resent illnesses?

970,GENHX,patient,What does that mean?
970,GENHX,doctor,"Well, in short, you broke the inside part of your elbow. In addition to the pain, do you have any burning or tingling feelings in that arm?"
970,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I do."
970,GENHX,doctor,Did you have this before they tried to do a reduction?
970,GENHX,patient,"No, I didn't, this is new."
970,GENHX,doctor,Is this feeling getting worse?
970,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it is."
970,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, guys, there is a lot of pressure on that ulnar nerve because of the break and the attempted reduction."
970,GENHX,doctor,We need to do an O R I F procedure A S A P. I'll reduce that radial shaft fracture at the same time.
970,GENHX,doctor,"I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process."
970,GENHX,doctor,"No, we need to do the surgery."
970,GENHX,doctor,"Historically, its less than one percent."
970,GENHX,doctor,"We use prophylactic antibiotics, this helps us control for infection the entire time."
970,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, she won't feel a thing."
970,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, in about a year or two, after everything is healed up nicely. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, and hardware failure. I see good results from my surgeries so I would not worry about these things, but I must disclose."
971,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, tell me did anyone in your family have Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?"
971,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Actually, my father passed away due to this disease."
971,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, sorry to hear that."
971,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah.
971,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anything else that he or any other family member might have.
971,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, he also had this spastic colon problem and irritable bowel syndrome."
971,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hm, I see."
971,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anything else?
971,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
972,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How are you today?
972,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I am doing okay.
972,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Do you have any medical conditions?
972,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I have diabetes.
972,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,When were you diagnosed with diabetes?
972,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"It was two thousand and three, I think. I also have high blood pressure, asthma and high cholesterol."
972,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Okay.
973,EXAM,doctor,I do not feel any swellings in your neck or groin area.
973,EXAM,patient,"Oh yeah, I don't notice anything either."
973,EXAM,doctor,"Okay yeah, I was just trying to look for any lymph nodes."
973,EXAM,patient,Okay.
973,EXAM,doctor,Let me check.
973,EXAM,patient,Sure.
974,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Your bloodwork came back from the Coumadin sensitivity test. The results showed a high level of sensitivity. I am going to adjust your dosage of Coumadin to a much lower dose. This will help reduce the bruising and the bleeding episodes. Do you have any questions?
974,ASSESSMENT,patient,No.
975,GENHX,doctor,Hello. You must be his mom.
975,GENHX,doctor,Hm.
975,GENHX,patient,I had a stuffy nose and it was hard to breathe.
975,GENHX,doctor,When did it all start?
975,GENHX,doctor,Any fever or any other symptoms?
975,GENHX,doctor,I can notice that his voice is a little bit hoarse. How's he eating and drinking?
975,GENHX,doctor,Any shortness of breath or pain in your stomach?
975,GENHX,patient,No.
975,GENHX,doctor,Any diarrhea or vomiting?
975,GENHX,patient,No.
976,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?"
976,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
977,GENHX,doctor,"What's a young thirty one year old like you doing in my office today, ma'am?"
977,GENHX,patient,"Well, I got referred to P T after I had a fall."
977,GENHX,doctor,When was your fall?
977,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was on October third two thousand eight."
977,GENHX,doctor,What happened when you fell?
977,GENHX,patient,I tripped over my dog's toy.
977,GENHX,doctor,Did you twist your foot or ankle?
977,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, my left foot inverted."
977,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any imaging done on this foot?
977,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, um, I've had x rays and an M R I already."
977,GENHX,doctor,What were the impressions of those images?
977,GENHX,patient,They told me that it was unremarkable.
977,GENHX,doctor,How was the pain progressed since the onset?
977,GENHX,patient,"Well, after a month or so, the pain is still so bad I can't do any of my activities."
977,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been wearing this walking boot?
977,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been about a month now."
978,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
978,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, that never really appealed to me, doctor."
978,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, what about more illicit substances?"
978,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, most certainly not."
978,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What about alcohol, do you drink?"
978,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I'd say I'm an occasional drinker."
979,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you mind elaborating more on your family history? Did either of your parents suffer from any medical problems?
979,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Sure. My dad had heart disease. He passed at seventy five. He had a sister with diabetes and I think my mom may have had diabetes as well.
979,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Got it.
979,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"As for my mom, she had a long history of mini strokes. She didn't have any memory problems or dementia when she passed at eighty five. They believe she passed due to old age."
979,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Thank you for further elaborating. I'm so sorry for your losses. Losing a parent let alone two is profoundly difficult.
980,EXAM,doctor,Any muscular pain?
980,EXAM,patient,"No, not really."
980,EXAM,doctor,Any problem in walking?
980,EXAM,patient,"No, it's normal."

980,EXAM,doctor,Everything looks fine. Nails looks fine too. No bluish discoloration no sign of any infection. Can you push your legs against my hand.
980,EXAM,patient,Both legs?
980,EXAM,doctor,"Yes, both. Well, your muscular strength is equal and stable in both legs, so that's fine. Motion looks adequate."
980,EXAM,doctor,Any tenderness?
980,EXAM,patient,No.
980,EXAM,doctor,And I don't see any swelling or fluid accumulation.
980,EXAM,patient,Okay.

983,GENHX,doctor,Are you still having trouble with urination?
983,GENHX,patient,It has gotten better but is still a little difficult.
983,GENHX,doctor,Okay. It looks like Doctor X did an exam yesterday. Doctor X consulted me on your status but I have a question for you. I see in your medical history that you had a bruised left kidney. Can you tell me more about the bruised kidney?
983,GENHX,patient,"Yes. I was in a car accident, years ago. The doctor told me that I had a bruised left kidney. They thought it was due to the accident, but they could not be certain."
984,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I have a long family history of heart problems. My mom died quite young at the age of fifty due to heart attack and my father was detected with heart failure, he has a pacemaker."
984,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, I am sorry to hear about your mom."
984,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah. Also, high blood pressure runs in my family."

985,CC,doctor,Does the pain come and go?
985,CC,patient,It does.
985,CC,doctor,And how would you describe-
985,CC,patient,The pain?
985,CC,doctor,Yes.

986,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I would like your recommendations for both.
986,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you working currently?

986,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Since this last March I have been feeling more social and have been doing things on my own more.
986,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That is great to hear.
987,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you have a history of surgeries?
987,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a bone fragment removed from my right arm. I had a D and C done a long time ago. It was a treatment for H P V. More recently I had an ovarian cancer staging biopsy done. I have not heard back with the results yet. I only had it done less then a week ago.
987,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,How are you feeling after the biopsy?
987,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a significant amount of pain for two to three days after. I feel better now.

989,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what brings you here?"
989,GENHX,patient,"I have so many issues and problems, where do I start?"
989,GENHX,doctor,Start by telling the one troubling you the most.
989,GENHX,patient,I have this pain in my toes on the right side and I also feel this numbness there.
989,GENHX,doctor,Okay and do you feel any tingling sensation? Or feeling like your leg is giving away?
989,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I feel the tingling and sometimes. I feel like my leg has fallen asleep."
989,GENHX,doctor,"Hm, tell me about your pain. Is it mild, moderate, or severe?"
989,GENHX,patient,"Well, I will say it's moderate."
989,GENHX,doctor,Would you define it as sharp shooting pain or dull kind of radiating pain?
989,GENHX,patient,Maybe sharp pain but I am not sure how to describe it. But it radiates up the leg.
989,GENHX,doctor,Okay. How long have you had this problem?
989,GENHX,patient,It's been there for almost one year but now it started to get worst.
989,GENHX,doctor,"I see, does it get worse when you walk?"
989,GENHX,patient,"No, mostly when I am in bed. And sometimes I feel it on my left toe as well."
989,GENHX,doctor,It looks like you have paresthesia in the toes of your right foot and I feel your left toe also has the same problem.
989,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I thought so. I read over the internet. But anyways, I am also having this shoulder pain on both sides, plus I am not able to sleep at night."
989,GENHX,patient,I have high blood pressure and hypothyroidism.
989,GENHX,doctor,Well-
989,GENHX,patient,"Well, that's not it. I have thrombo-"
989,GENHX,doctor,Thrombocythemia.
989,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that."
989,GENHX,doctor,How are your allergies by the way?

991,GENHX,doctor,How about any congestion? Is it one week or more?
991,GENHX,doctor,"Don't worry let me see, can you tell me everything from the beginning?"
991,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, what else?"
991,GENHX,doctor,"It is possible, have you seen any change in his breathing?"
991,GENHX,doctor,Any fever?
991,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hi, how are you?"
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I am good, Doctor."
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, I see you recently moved to U S A from Brazil, right?"
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, about one year back. I was an engineer manager back there, but my job was so stressful that when I got admitted in the M B A program here in the states, I took it."
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Wow, that's quite a move!"
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah.
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about your family; wife or girlfriend?
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am a one women man. I married my childhood sweetheart.
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Nice. Did you travel outside the country recently or have risk of any kind of exposure?
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I haven't traveled anywhere not even within the country."
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay. Tell me something, do you smoke or drink?"
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't."
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And have you in the past used any recreational or illegal drugs?
992,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, never."
992,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, good."
993,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you drink, sir?"
993,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't drink at all."
993,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How about tobacco? Do you smoke?
993,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, yes."
993,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How much do you smoke, sir?"
993,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I smoke about a half a pack of cigarettes a day.
994,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling? You have been sick?
994,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I am not feeling well for the last three days.  I have bad body aches, cough and a sore throat."
994,GENHX,doctor,Do you get wet cough or it's dry? What color sputum comes out?
994,GENHX,patient,It is wet and green colored stuff comes out.
994,GENHX,doctor,"Okay we will need to send it out to culture, maybe an infection."
994,GENHX,doctor,"How about fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea anything like that? Are you sleeping well?"
994,GENHX,patient,Everything is fine except some chills? I am sleeping okay.
994,GENHX,doctor,Do you need anything for cough?
994,GENHX,patient,I don't need anything for the cough. I did call yesterday and got a refill of my Keflex. Then I took two Keflex this morning and I am feeling little bit better now.
994,GENHX,doctor,"Okay then why are you crying, ma'am?"
994,GENHX,patient,I am just tired of feeling like ran down.
994,GENHX,doctor,I am so sorry.
994,GENHX,patient,Hm.
995,CC,doctor,"Hi there, what's going on with you?"
995,CC,patient,"Well, I am having this weird jerky movement in my arm and leg."
995,CC,doctor,"Oh okay, let me take a look."
996,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir. Is this your mother?"
996,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, this is my mom."
996,GENHX,doctor,"Great, please, give me some background information on your history."
996,GENHX,patient,"Well, I used to live here in the city when I went to college, but I wanted to get away from a bad crowd, so I came back to live with my mom."
996,GENHX,doctor,"What do you mean, bad crowd?"
996,GENHX,patient,"Well, I got addicted to drugs out there, and I used to inject heroin."
996,GENHX,doctor,Did you see a doctor for this addiction?
996,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I saw another doctor in the city."
996,GENHX,doctor,How did they treat you at that time?
996,GENHX,patient,They prescribed me methadone for a while.
996,GENHX,doctor,Did that help at all?
996,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, no, it didn't help at all."
996,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember the dosage that you were given?
996,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was ten M G."
996,GENHX,doctor,How long did you take methadone for?
996,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was for three or four months."
996,GENHX,doctor,Did you ever try to decrease your dosage?
996,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, um, I tried to wean off it for a while, but I was never really successful."
996,GENHX,doctor,Have you been using heroin since?
996,GENHX,patient,"Um, yeah, I've been using it occasionally."
996,GENHX,doctor,Were you roommates at school using drugs?
996,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, so it's hard to get away from the stuff, it was all over the house."
996,GENHX,doctor,"Good, when was the last time you used heroin?"
996,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been about eight days now."
996,GENHX,doctor,"Good, congratulations. When was the last time you had methadone?"
996,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been about a week for that now, too. Am I able to get more today?"
996,GENHX,doctor,We can discuss that. Have you had any feelings of depression recently?
996,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I feel down and sad a lot."
996,GENHX,doctor,What about your energy?
996,GENHX,patient,I really don't have much.
996,GENHX,doctor,What about your enthusiasm for the foods or activities you enjoy?
996,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any suicidal or homicidal thoughts or actions at this time?
996,GENHX,doctor,"Good, what about delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thoughts or behaviors?"
996,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that either, doctor."
996,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any medical conditions in the past that I should know about?
996,GENHX,patient,"No, not that I know of."
996,GENHX,doctor,"You completed your family and social history earlier with the nurses, is there anything you want to add to that?"
996,GENHX,patient,"No, everything there is complete."
996,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any allergies?
996,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't have any."
996,GENHX,doctor,"Good, and do you take any medications right now?"
996,GENHX,patient,"No, doctor. I don't take anything."
996,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any surgeries in the past?
996,GENHX,patient,I voluntarily donated my left kidney.
997,CC,doctor,"Hi there, how is it going?"
997,CC,doctor,Nice to meet you.
997,CC,doctor,"So, I see your father has a history of drug abuse, right?"
997,CC,patient,"Not abuse, I just used to do drugs. The last time I really made a big mistake I injected the heroine directly into both of my thighs and unfortunately, I got these ulcers which are not going away."
997,CC,doctor,"Yeah, this is really unfortunate. I can see these open wounds, it's because of the chronic abscesses."
997,CC,doctor,"Yeah, I see that. How old is your father?"
997,CC,doctor,Does he have any other medical issues like sugar or blood pressure?
997,CC,doctor,"Okay, I think we need to surgically remove this whole area and then do a reconstruction."
997,CC,doctor,"According to me, yes! I mean the wounds are not healing and it is only getting worst."
997,CC,doctor,Okay.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products, miss?"
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you drink alcohol and if so, how many drinks do you consume in a typical week?"
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't drink.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use any recreational drug or other substances?
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have children?
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I have three kids.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do your children have any health conditions?
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
998,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
998,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
999,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How is your family doing?
999,FAM/SOCHX,patient,They all are good.
999,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you aware of any medical issues in your family?
999,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, not to my knowledge."
1000,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you ever had spine problems before?
1000,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"What, like an injury?"
1000,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Well, it's broad. It could be an injury, or just any kind of pain."
1000,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, no. I've never had any problems."
1001,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any past medical history?
1001,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No.
1002,GENHX,doctor,"With ten being the worse pain ever, how would you rate your pain out of ten today, ma'am?"
1002,GENHX,patient,"Um, out of ten, I'd say it's about a two."
1002,GENHX,doctor,That's good. What helps the pain feel better?
1002,GENHX,patient,"Um, it gets better with elevation, and when I just rest."
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Nurse, did you get the documents from the patient?"
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, Nurse. What is she here for today?"
1003,GENHX,doctor,Sounds good. Was there anything else?
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go see her now."
1003,GENHX,patient,Hello Doctor. I've been waiting a long time. I'm getting impatient as I get older.
1003,GENHX,doctor,"What? You don't look old at all, ma'am."
1003,GENHX,patient,"Oh, wow. That's a nice compliment for a sixty year old lady."
1003,GENHX,doctor,How can I help you today?
1003,GENHX,patient,"I have these super bad headaches. Help me, please."
1003,GENHX,doctor,When did they start?
1003,GENHX,patient,I had them since I was twenty five years old.
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. That long? Did you get them every day since then?"
1003,GENHX,patient,Not every day. That's crazy. I did get them more when my husband died in nineteen ninety six. I was heartbroken.
1003,GENHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. How did the headaches feel?
1003,GENHX,patient,It felt like a drum in my head.
1003,GENHX,doctor,I haven't heard that description before. Would you say it was pulsating?
1003,GENHX,patient,Something like that. Yes.
1003,GENHX,doctor,Did you take any medication?
1003,GENHX,patient,Lots of it. My son wrote it on a paper so that I could give you the names. Here you go.
1003,GENHX,doctor,I see you were given papaverine. Did that help?
1003,GENHX,patient,They did. My headaches would vanish.
1003,GENHX,doctor,How long did you take it for?
1003,GENHX,patient,"I think six months. My headaches stopped for a while, but they came back in two thousand and four."
1003,GENHX,doctor,How often would you say you get headaches now?
1003,GENHX,patient,I think more than before. Like one to two per week. I also get some dizziness too. It says for two hours.
1003,GENHX,doctor,Do you take the papaverine when you feel it?
1003,GENHX,patient,I do. My headaches vanish after thirty minutes of taking it.
1003,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you ever experience any problems with your vision too?
1003,GENHX,patient,Yes. A lot. There were zig zag lines coming out of nowhere. I thought I was going to die.
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. I will do a test right now to check your vision."
1003,GENHX,patient,Will you use a bright pen?
1003,GENHX,doctor,I will. Does it give you any discomfort?
1003,GENHX,patient,The bright light hurts my eyes.
1003,GENHX,doctor,"I see. I'll only do it to the side then. Just look forward for me, please."
1003,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
1003,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to see the light?
1003,GENHX,patient,What light?
1003,GENHX,doctor,It looks like you have trouble seeing things in your peripheral vision. The discomfort you experience with bright lights is also called photophobia.
1003,GENHX,patient,That sounds scary. Will I be fine?
1003,GENHX,doctor,Yeah. You don't have to worry. Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness right now?
1003,GENHX,patient,"Now that you mentioned it, I am."
1003,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever fainted before?
1003,GENHX,patient,I think one time. My son was there to help.
1003,GENHX,doctor,That's good to hear. I'll write down that you experienced a syncope. Did you take any medication for this?
1003,GENHX,patient,I took some Russian medicine.
1003,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, wow. Are you from Russia?"
1003,GENHX,patient,No. I'm from Ukraine.
1003,GENHX,doctor,That's wonderful. How did the medicine help?
1003,GENHX,patient,It helped me a lot.
1004,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
1004,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I used to drink before, but now I have stopped it completely."
1004,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How would you rate your pain?
1004,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"It is tolerable, like five out of ten but I do need some pain medications."
1004,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Then why do you need more pain medications?
1004,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sometimes it gets hard, I really need some more pain medications."
1004,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have morphine? Do you need more?
1004,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I don't like morphine. Can you change it to Dilaudid? I like that medicine. That one works for me great.
1005,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Yeah, I am looking at her reports. She had surgery for spina bifida when she was a baby and they had to put a shunt."

1008,GENHX,patient,"Um, at this point it's been about two months."
1008,GENHX,doctor,Where do you see this rash?
1008,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's right here, on my chest, stomach, neck, and back, it's all over my upper body."
1008,GENHX,doctor,"I see, it appears that your acne is flaring, and there are small lesions on the follicles as well. Have you been taking your Amoxicillin and using your Tazorac?"
1008,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I taken five hundred M G of amoxicillin twice a day, and I use the cream as well."
1008,GENHX,doctor,"Good, the acne on your face appears to be clearing."
1008,GENHX,patient,"Thank you, I've been out of medicine for about three days now though."
1008,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, we might refill that. Have you had any other treatments aside from what I've done? I"
1008,GENHX,patient,"Um, my husband drove me to Healing Waters and they did, um, photofacials. Is there anything that can be done in the office today, like, um, cosmetic procedures, or do you have any skin care products? I want to keep up my appearances since I work the front office as a secretary."
1009,ASSESSMENT,doctor,It looks like your Xrays show bronchitis.
1009,ASSESSMENT,patient,Is there anything I can take for it?
1009,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yes, I'm going to prescribe you something that will help clear your lungs."
1010,GENHX,doctor,How's it going X Y Z? I see you're in a walking boot. What happened?
1010,GENHX,patient,I hurt my foot pretty bad yesterday.
1010,GENHX,doctor,How'd it happen?
1010,GENHX,patient,Basketball. I play for the University of Houston. I went up for a three and came down and landed on this guy's foot. I was so pissed.
1010,GENHX,doctor,"Dang, that sucks. Were you guys playing a home game?"
1010,GENHX,patient,We were traveling to Duke. We could've won the game if I didn't get hurt.
1010,GENHX,doctor,You'll get them next time. Did you keep playing?
1010,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I did. I got taped up by the trainer, and I went back into the game."
1010,GENHX,doctor,I see. Who was the trainer that helped you?
1010,GENHX,patient,His name is John Houston. Do you know him?
1010,GENHX,doctor,"Oh, John! He's a good friend of mine."
1010,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, he told me to come see you. He checked my foot. Here's the notes he wrote."
1010,GENHX,doctor,"It looks like you have some tenderness around your navicular, which is a bone in your ankle."
1010,GENHX,patient,"Dang, that's whack."
1010,GENHX,doctor,Which way did you twist your ankle?
1010,GENHX,patient,My foot twisted inwards. Kind of like this.
1010,GENHX,doctor,I see. Your foot inverted. Did it swell up right away?
1010,GENHX,patient,"Aw, man. My foot was huge right after it happened. It hurt so much too."
1010,GENHX,doctor,Continue to keep that tape on. Are you limping or anything?
1010,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I am. I can't really put weight on my foot because it'll hurt a lot."
1010,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Well, I examined your foot, and it looks like the pain is around the top, back and middle of your foot."
1011,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yeah so, we call it foreign body impaction. It is mostly affecting his right nostril and as you said there is constipation."
1012,GENHX,patient,I was working when it happened so we are going through workers comp.

1022,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I did not do any exertion. Just actively smoking that's all."
1023,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I am sorry about that.
1023,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, for assault, that's why I was in detention."
1023,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
1023,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,When was this?
1023,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Around December of two thousand nine.

1028,GENHX,doctor,"What is more difficult, day or night?"
1028,GENHX,patient,"It gets worse at night. If I sleep on it, like in a certain way, it will just wake me up and it starts hurting. These tingling sensations are the worst. It helps if I shake it then the sensation goes away. It irritates me all the time."
1028,GENHX,doctor,Is it complete hand or is there any part of hand that is worse than others?

1034,GENHX,patient,Couple years ago.
1034,GENHX,doctor,In what ways has it worsened?

1035,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Hm!
1036,GENHX,doctor,"So, tell me what's going on with you?"
1036,GENHX,patient,"Well, yesterday evening between seven or eight I developed nausea and suddenly it started hurting on the right side of my chest?"

1036,GENHX,patient,Absolutely! Until yesterday when my nausea and pain started.
1036,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
1037,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Okay, so it looks like your blood work shows that your sodium levels are very low. This could explain some of the symptoms you've been having lately."
1037,ASSESSMENT,patient,What does that mean? Why are my sodium levels so low?
1037,ASSESSMENT,doctor,It could be due to a number of-
1037,ASSESSMENT,patient,Should I start eating more salt?
1037,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Not necessarily. But I believe it's partly due to the diuretic that you've been taking these past few weeks. Your blood work also shows anemia. I'd like to start you on some iron supplements for now and get you back in for another eval. The front desk has access to your orders and they can print you out a lab slip.
1037,ASSESSMENT,patient,Do you think the iron will help with my tiredness? I've been so exhausted and caffeine hasn't been helping one bit.
1038,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, you are a cigarette smoker?"
1038,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah.
1038,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you some?

1038,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I guess so."
1039,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you married, sir?"
1039,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, to my wonderful wife."
1039,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Great, can I assume you support each other at home?"
1039,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
1039,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you smoke or drink, sir?"
1039,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I don't smoke, and I don't do anything harder, either. But I drink just about every day."
1039,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you drink a day?
1039,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I drink maybe two or three drinks a day, so maybe four or nine a week."
1040,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you know if anyone in your family has history of heart disease, stroke anything of that sort?"
1040,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Let me think. You mean only blood relatives?
1040,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Yes.

1041,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Maybe. And I have had my tonsils and appendix taken out.
1041,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Sure. Okay.
1042,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you tell me more about this low back pain?"
1042,GENHX,patient,"Well, I'm not as young as I used to be, I'm fifty nine."
1042,GENHX,doctor,What set this pain off? Is there any injury?
1042,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I had a fall in the beginning of two thousand six. I slipped on a freshly waxed floor."
1042,GENHX,doctor,What part of your lower back did you fall onto?
1042,GENHX,patient,I fell onto my tailbone and just general lower back.
1042,GENHX,doctor,Is this the only fall you've had?
1042,GENHX,patient,"No, I had another one in March of two thousand six."
1042,GENHX,doctor,What happened when you fell that time?
1042,GENHX,patient,"I was trying to qualify on the gun range with a handgun, when I lost my footing."
1042,GENHX,doctor,What made you lose your footing?
1042,GENHX,patient,I think it was more weakness than a loss of balance.
1042,GENHX,doctor,What treatments have you had for this?
1042,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've been to P T, and I had, um, cauterization of some of the nerves in my lower back."
1042,GENHX,doctor,How many times have you had this cauterization done?
1042,GENHX,patient,"I've had it twice, once in October and the other in November."
1042,GENHX,doctor,"This was in two thousand eight, right?"
1042,GENHX,patient,Correct. The P T said I have low back pain and degenerative disc disease.
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?"
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, doctor, I've had a whole lifetime worth of back surgeries."
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,How many surgeries have you had?
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I've had four.
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you know the surgeries you've had?
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Actually, I have the op notes here."
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"I see, you've had an anterior cervical discectomy, and fusion of C three through C seven."
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes, I had all of those with Doctor L."
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Do you have any children?
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yes doctor, I have seven, but I had three miscarriages."
1043,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Were any of your children born through C sections?
1043,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"No, none of them were."
1044,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you ever had any major surgeries?
1044,PASTSURGICAL,patient,I had a skin tag removed but no. No major surgeries.
1044,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay.
1045,GENHX,doctor,"With ten being the worst pain imaginable, out of ten, how would you describe your pain today?"
1045,GENHX,patient,I'd say its about a six out of ten today.
1045,GENHX,doctor,What makes the pain worse?
1045,GENHX,patient,It's worse when I try to walk around on it.
1045,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any pain at night?
1045,GENHX,patient,"No, thankfully I don't."
1045,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been wearing that exterior knee brace?
1045,GENHX,patient,"Oh, for a little while now."
1046,ROS,doctor,I need to ask you a few questions.
1046,ROS,patient,Sure.
1046,ROS,doctor,Do you feel any weakness or tiredness?
1046,ROS,patient,No.
1046,ROS,doctor,Any uneasiness or illness?
1046,ROS,patient,"No, nothing of that sort."
1046,ROS,doctor,Any chills or high temperature?
1046,ROS,patient,Nope.
1046,ROS,doctor,Any excessive sweating or night sweating?
1046,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
1046,ROS,doctor,"How about allergies, are you allergic to anything?"
1046,ROS,patient,"No, no allergies."
1046,ROS,doctor,Alright.
1047,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
1047,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
1047,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any drug use?
1047,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
1048,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
1048,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes!
1048,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How about alcohol, do you drink?"
1048,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I do."
1048,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And how much do you drink and is it occasional or on daily basis?
1048,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I love my wine, I drink about four to five glasses per day."
1048,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wow! That's a lot.
1049,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
1049,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
1050,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Any important family history, any medical issues in the family?"
1050,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, my father died of a heart attack. I don't remember how old he was, but I do remember that he had some long run heart issues."
1050,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about your mom?
1050,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My mom's death was a mystery for all of us. She died of some complications because of the dental procedures. So never got to know what killed her.
1050,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have kids? Are they all doing good health wise?
1050,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I have a daughter, she's healthy."
1051,CC,doctor,Hi there! How are you today?
1051,CC,patient,Hi. I am not doing so well. I have had this cough and a pain in my stomach. Right here by my belly button.
1051,CC,doctor,How long has this been going on?
1051,CC,patient,Two days.  It has been very painful.
1051,CC,doctor,I would like to examine your abdomen. Is that okay?
1051,CC,patient,Yes.
1052,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Can you please confirm the medications that you have already taken?
1052,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yeah, I just finished the course for Minocin. I also took Duraphen II D M."
1053,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Has anyone in your family had a history of heart disease or issues?
1053,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, yeah. Actually, my dad passed away due heart disease."
1053,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what kind of heart problem he had?"
1053,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, it is called co-"
1053,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Oh, coronary heart disease?"
1053,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, exactly!"
1053,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see.
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. Just to confirm, you're thirty two years old, correct?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Good, so, have you been able to get a P C P yet?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't gotten one just yet."
1054,GENHX,doctor,Are you in the process of getting one?
1054,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, Project Access is trying to find me one."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Good, um, what seems to be the problem today, then?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was at Doctor X Y Z's office today, I had an appointment, but they cancelled me because I don't have the Project Access insurance yet."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"I see, what were you going to see Doctor X Y Z for?"
1054,GENHX,patient,I'm having a lot of pain in my foot.
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, have you seen Doctor X Y Z before?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I saw him on May fourteenth two thousand four."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"But you still don't have a P C P, correct?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, we've seen you quite a few times in here. You were in here last week and saw Doctor X Y Z for some back pain, how did they treat you?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Um, I got some pain medicines and muscle relaxers."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so, can you tell me more about your foot, please?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Well, I have this pain in my foot, and I had surgery before so there's plates and screws in it."
1054,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever talked to anyone about removing this hardware?
1054,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was supposed to see Doctor X Y Z about it, but since that appointment was cancelled, I came here."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"I see, how long have you had this foot pain?"
1054,GENHX,patient,"Um, it started hurting a lot yesterday."
1054,GENHX,doctor,Is there any injury here?
1054,GENHX,patient,"No, it's just chronically painful, honestly."
1054,GENHX,doctor,Do any activities bother it?
1054,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I can't exercise without a lot of pain."
1054,GENHX,doctor,"I see, well, we've x rayed this before, and I see the hardware in there, but there's no apparent abnormality or evidence of loosening, at least from what I can see."
1055,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
1055,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
1055,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any drugs?
1055,FAM/SOCHX,patient,You mean like meth?
1055,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Yeah.
1055,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, never did it."
1055,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay.
1056,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. How are you? What brings you to my office today?"
1056,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I am doing well. Just here for a refill on my medication.
1056,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great. That should be easy. How has the stress management been going to control the acne?
1056,FAM/SOCHX,patient,It is going well. My husband has been on board with my meditations and yoga. He is very supportive.
1056,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wonderful. Are will still clean from drinking and smoking? That can interact with your medications.
1056,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah I know. I don't drink or smoke.
1057,MEDICATIONS,doctor,So I have here that you're taking three different medications.
1057,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yeah. I've been taking them every day just like they told me to.
1057,MEDICATIONS,doctor,I see. That's good. Did you refill your prescriptions with the newly revised doses? It looks like they changed the dosing of your medications at the hospital.
1057,MEDICATIONS,patient,Um I've just been taking what I have at home.
1057,MEDICATIONS,doctor,"I advise that you take the doses that they prescribed. If you'd like me to put in a new order, please let me know."
1057,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Okay, yeah that's fine. I can pick it up on my way home. I didn't think the dosing mattered much as long as I took the meds every day."
1058,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Any major surgeries in the past?
1058,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Not too many, but a catheter was put in my heart."
1058,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Oh, so cardiac catherization, correct?"
1058,PASTSURGICAL,patient,Yep.
1059,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, sir. I see you're being seen for an evaluation for your allergy. Can you please confirm your age?"
1059,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's right. Thirty four."
1059,GENHX,doctor,"Let me take a look at your medical records. I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct?"
1059,GENHX,patient,"Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up."
1059,GENHX,doctor,Who told you to have a follow up?
1059,GENHX,patient,One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor.
1059,GENHX,doctor,I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day.
1059,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that?"
1059,GENHX,doctor,"Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell?"
1059,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me."
1059,GENHX,doctor,"Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection."
1059,GENHX,patient,"Oh, I see."
1059,GENHX,doctor,I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to?
1059,GENHX,patient,I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen.
1059,GENHX,doctor,"I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions?"
1059,GENHX,patient,Nope. Never had that.
1059,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched?
1059,GENHX,patient,Nope. Never had that either.
1059,GENHX,doctor,"That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure?"
1059,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I do."
1059,GENHX,doctor,I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital.
1059,GENHX,patient,What were the treatments they gave me?
1059,GENHX,doctor,Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well.
1060,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,That is not true!
1060,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Miss Tara, you need to take your medications on time. You are hypertensive and your readings don't look good."
1060,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I don't want to take anymore medications. I want to try some natural remedies to treat my high blood pressure. I am not going to take any prescription meds that's it.
1060,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,If that's the case then I will make note in your file that you are not complying.
1061,CC,patient,"I think I got some allergy, my lips are swollen and its causing me difficulty in swallowing."
1061,CC,doctor,"Oh, let me take a look."
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any medical history?
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Um I suffer from depression and high blood pressure.
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you taking anything for either?
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Only for high blood pressure.
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Have you had surgeries in the past?
1062,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I had surgery to get a few hemorrhoids removed back in two thousand and ten.
1063,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease?"
1063,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, nothing."
1064,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How's your family?
1064,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"They're doing well, thank you. My three boys are all grown up. Hard to believe they're living their own as young professionals. One of them is actually a G I doctor in San Diego, California."
1064,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,You must be so proud of your boys.
1064,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My wife and I always say how lucky we are.
1064,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm sure. And I have a few more questions before we wrap up.
1064,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Go for it.
1064,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink or smoke?
1064,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I smoke about a third of a pack a day and I drink every now and again, but nothing crazy."
1065,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"How's it going, buddy? I haven't seen you in a long time"
1065,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hey, Doctor. It's been a while. I've been doing well. Just here for my check up."
1065,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Nice. How's the family doing? Are they all well?
1065,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, they're doing great. Nobody has been sick for a while."
1065,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"That's great to hear. Nobody has new medical conditions either, right?"
1065,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Not that I know of. They're all doing good.
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, you and your husband live together, correct?"
1066,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. It's a miracle we've lasted this long.
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you able to walk any distance without assistance?
1066,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, he's right."
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And how often do you walk with your walker?
1066,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"If I were to guess, I'd say half the time."
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great.
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,It's good that you're both looking out for each other. Now moving onto the last few questions. Do you smoke or drink?
1066,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No and no.
1066,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did you smoke or drink in the past?
1066,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
1067,CC,doctor,You do not look so well today. What seems to be the problem?
1067,CC,patient,Well‚ I am having a hard time. My whole body aches and I am in pain.
1067,CC,doctor,Do you have a history of drug use?
1067,CC,patient,Well yes. I am detoxing.
1067,CC,doctor,What kind of drugs have you been using?
1067,CC,patient,Heroin.
1067,CC,doctor,Okay. How long have you been using?
1067,CC,patient,I don't feel well. Maybe a year. I can't sleep or eat.
1067,CC,doctor,"Have you had a fever, chills, vomiting or diarrhea?"
1067,CC,patient,I think I have a fever. I feel chilled. I have had some diarrhea.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How would you rate your general health?
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"I've been in reasonably good health at least physically. I try to go on frequent walks and eat a clean diet. However, there was one instance where I was not well mentally. After my husband died in nineteen seventy five, I had what I believe was a nervous breakdown. As a result of this, I was hospitalized for several weeks and treated with E C T."
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your husband. I can't imagine how difficult that must've been. I'm glad that you sought the care that you needed to feel better at that time. Did this happen when you were living in the United States or Korea?
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,This all happened when I was living in Korea. I'm grateful that I had my family and friends to support me.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Social support is very important, especially when you are processing the loss of a loved one."
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Absolutely.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I have a few more questions before we move on. Any past medical problems?
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I used to have high blood pressure.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"When you say used to, do you mean it's been resolved now?"
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Great news. How about surgeries? Have you had any in the past?
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,None whatsoever.
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any alcohol or tobacco?
1068,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, I stay away from things like that."
1069,ROS,doctor,"Are you experiencing any headaches, or do you have any history of migraine?"
1069,ROS,patient,No.
1069,ROS,doctor,Any temporary loss of consciousness?
1069,ROS,patient,No.
1069,ROS,doctor,Any feeling of being off balance or fainting?
1069,ROS,patient,No.
1069,ROS,doctor,Any continuous sound you may hear?
1069,ROS,patient,No.
1069,ROS,doctor,Okay so no tinnitus. Any mouth sores or ulcers?
1069,ROS,patient,"Um, no."
1069,ROS,doctor,"Do you notice any change in your voice, any hoarseness?"
1069,ROS,patient,"No, nothing like that."
1069,ROS,doctor,Did you notice any swelling in and around your mouth?
1069,ROS,patient,"No, I did not."
1069,ROS,doctor,Any history of goiter or swelling of your thyroid gland?
1069,ROS,patient,Nope.
1069,ROS,doctor,Okay.
1070,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. How can I help?"
1070,GENHX,patient,"Well, I just turned fifty seven this year and I would like to get rid of these wrinkles on my face. I don't like them one bit."
1070,GENHX,doctor,You look beautiful and actually have a lot of fullness in the face.  It is great that you do not smoke and do not have history of skin disease. We can definitely help you with these minor issues.
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
1071,GENHX,patient,"Good afternoon, doctor."
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Remind me, how young are you?"
1071,GENHX,patient,"Oh doctor, you flatter me. I'm sixty two years old."
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Great, and you've had a rotator cuff repair before, correct?"
1071,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct."
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Good, well, what seems to be the problem today?"
1071,GENHX,patient,I'm still having a lot of pain in this shoulder.
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Oh no, have you had any recent imaging done on this shoulder?"
1071,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I had an M R I not too long ago, can you take a look? I have it right here."
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, yes, um, this M R I shows that you've torn that rotator cuff again."
1071,GENHX,patient,"Oh no, can we do another surgery to repair it again?"
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, we'll have to."
1071,GENHX,patient,What's the risk of infection of the surgery?
1071,GENHX,doctor,Its less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time.
1071,GENHX,patient,Will I be asleep again?
1071,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
1071,GENHX,patient,"Great, yes, I'd like to go forward with the surgery. I need to get back to playing tennis."
1072,GENHX,doctor,What brings you in today?
1072,GENHX,patient,I dropped a glass and one of the broken pieces cut my foot pretty badly. There was a lot of blood.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Is the area still bleeding?
1072,GENHX,patient,I got it to stop bleeding while I was waiting for my ride.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Is there any pain in the area?
1072,GENHX,patient,"No, it doesn't hurt."
1072,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to walk normally without pain or discomfort?
1072,GENHX,patient,Yes.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing any numbness or loss of strength in the area?
1072,GENHX,patient,No.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other injuries on any other part of your body?
1072,GENHX,patient,No.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any recent illnesses?
1072,GENHX,patient,No.
1072,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other concerns while you are here today?
1072,GENHX,patient,No.
1073,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What do you do for a living, sir?"
1073,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm actually retired, but I used to work as a dock hand."
1073,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"That's great, congratulations on your retirement!"
1073,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you so much, doctor."
1073,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I just need some background information on you, sir. Do you smoke?"
1073,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Sure, I smoke about a half a pack of cigarettes a day."
1073,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you drink, sir?"
1073,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, not anymore, but I used to be an alcoholic."
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,Any surgical history?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,I had my thyroids taken out.
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,When did you have them taken out?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,"Hm three years ago. Man, time flies."
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,Did you experience any complications post surgery?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,Nothing out of the ordinary.
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,Who was the surgeon who did your thyroidectomy?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,Doctor X.
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,What was the final diagnosis?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,I had a growth on my thyroids.
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,Was the growth cancerous?
1074,PROCEDURES,patient,"It was. I was initially reluctant to get them out, but I realized it was necessary. I didn't have much of a choice if I wanted to live ya know."
1074,PROCEDURES,doctor,"That's understandable. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Surgery is daunting, let alone surgery to remove cancer."
1075,GENHX,doctor,Welcome in. I am Doctor Welch.
1075,GENHX,doctor,How old is your daughter?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Hi there!
1075,GENHX,patient,Hi!
1075,GENHX,doctor,"Mom I would like to start off with some questions regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and prior children."
1075,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other children?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had any miscarriages or abortions prior to having your daughter?
1075,GENHX,doctor,I am so sorry to hear that.
1075,GENHX,doctor,Did you have any difficulties or problems during your pregnancy with her.
1075,GENHX,doctor,How far along were you when you gave birth?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Did you have a vaginal birth or a C section?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Were any tools used during the birth to help with the birthing process?
1075,GENHX,doctor,How long were you in labor for?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Were you given any anesthesia during the birth?
1075,GENHX,doctor,What was her birth weight?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Do you recall her Apgars score?
1075,GENHX,doctor,How long did you stay in the hospital after the birth?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Let us move to questions regarding your daughter. Has she had any development problems?
1075,GENHX,doctor,Okay. How old was she when she spoke her first words?
1075,GENHX,doctor,"When did she start to feed herself, using her hands?"
1075,GENHX,doctor,Has she been toilet trained yet?
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay and are you working?
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh yes, I am a farmer. I have a farmland and my wife, and I do farming."
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, so you are one happy married couple working together."
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Ah, yes."
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And how about tobacco, do you smoke or eat?"
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Absolutely not.
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any use of drugs or alcohol?
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Drugs?
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yeah, like cocaine or anything like that."
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh that, no. No drugs."
1076,FAM/SOCHX,patient,And I don't drink either.
1076,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Alright.
1077,EXAM,doctor,"Well, looking at your hand x ray, the bone looks in alignment, and I don't see any effusion."
1077,EXAM,doctor,Any tenderness or pain?
1077,EXAM,patient,"Ah, not really!"
1077,EXAM,doctor,There is no asymmetry. Can you move your hand up and down? Now rotate it. Can you move your fingers?
1077,EXAM,patient,"Yes, I can do all of that, no problem at all."
1077,EXAM,doctor,Can you bend your hand?
1077,EXAM,patient,Yes.
1077,EXAM,doctor,Perfect.
1078,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,How about any surgeries in the past?
1078,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Well, I had colon surgery in nineteen eighty nine or was it ninety, oh yeah in nineteen ninety."
1078,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Okay and anything else?
1078,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Ah yes, I had three surgeries for my sinus one was the same year as my colon surgery, one was before that. So, the first one was in nineteen eighty seven I believe then nineteen ninety and the last one was in two thousand five."
1078,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Wow, you remember the years also."
1078,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, surprisingly."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you drink or smoke, sir?"
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'd say I have the occasional drink, but I don't smoke."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for a living?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm a nursing aid in a nursing home right now.
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you work the normal day shift?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I work the second shift, so I work some late nights and early mornings."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you back at Wichita State this semester?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I decided to take some time off."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is everything okay?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I'm just really tired, so I decided to step away for a little."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's understandable. Are you dating right now?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I've been dating my boyfriend for a while now."
1079,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Is there any significant stress in your relationship?
1079,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, everything is going really well."
1080,GENHX,doctor,"What brings you in today, miss?"
1080,GENHX,patient,I haven't been feeling well since I went to the dentist.
1080,GENHX,doctor,When did you go to the dentist?
1080,GENHX,patient,It was in May last year.
1080,GENHX,doctor,"What happened at the dentist? Also, sorry, but how old are you."
1080,GENHX,patient,"It was after I left the dentist. I was driving home, and I got lightheaded. I was so lightheaded that I had to pull over."
1080,GENHX,doctor,How long did the episode last?
1080,GENHX,patient,About two to three minutes.
1080,GENHX,doctor,Is this the only time that this has happened?
1080,GENHX,patient,"No. In November last year, I was in the middle of eating breakfast when I got dizzy. I was so dizzy that I was nauseous, and I threw up several times. I was so exhausted from the dizziness and throwing up that I went to my room and took a two hour nap. I felt better and back to normal after I woke up from my nap."
1080,GENHX,doctor,How long did the vertigo last?
1080,GENHX,patient,"It lasted about two to three minutes. So, about the same amount of time."
1080,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any other dizzy episodes?
1080,GENHX,patient,No I didn't but in January on the thirteenth my right arm went numb. It lasted for about four to five hours.
1080,GENHX,doctor,"Are you left handed, or right?"
1080,GENHX,patient,I am right handed.
1080,GENHX,doctor,Have you experienced any slurred speech or trouble swallowing?
1080,GENHX,patient,No.
1080,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any continuing weakness other than the time in January?
1080,GENHX,patient,No.
1080,GENHX,doctor,Have you experienced any headaches or visual changes?
1080,GENHX,patient,No.
1080,GENHX,doctor,Any continuing vertigo or lightheadedness?
1080,GENHX,patient,No.
1081,GENHX,doctor,"Oh wow, you got stung quite a few times."
1081,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, you're right about that.  In my seventy six years this i have never gotten stung. This is new."
1081,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, they got both my hands and right knee. Those little monsters."
1081,GENHX,doctor,Did you notice redness and swelling right away?
1081,GENHX,patient,Um not right away.
1081,GENHX,doctor,How long did it take for your body to react?
1081,GENHX,patient,Bout thirty minutes or so.
1081,GENHX,doctor,"Did you experience any shortness of breath, itching, or hives?"
1081,GENHX,patient,"No, surprisingly."
1081,GENHX,doctor,And no tongue swelling or trouble swallowing?
1081,GENHX,patient,No.
1081,GENHX,doctor,Have you gotten stung in the past? Or is this your first time?
1081,GENHX,patient,I got stung about a month ago. No redness or swelling like I do now. I guess it could've been due to the Benadryl I took as soon as it happened.
1081,GENHX,doctor,Did you take Benadryl again today?
1081,GENHX,patient,"No, I figured I'd be okay."
1081,GENHX,patient,And a baby Aspirin in the mornings.
1081,GENHX,doctor,Did you take your daily medications today?
1081,GENHX,patient,"Yeah."""
1082,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
1082,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I was adopted.  I don't know my family medical history.
1083,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Were you ever diagnosed with any blood or heart disease?
1083,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Uh no.
1083,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any other past medical issues?
1083,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,No.
1084,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Any major or minor surgeries done in the past?
1085,MEDICATIONS,doctor,I can see your medication list here.
1085,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Do you take Accutane and Ovcon?
1085,MEDICATIONS,patient,"Yes, I do."
1085,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay.
1085,MEDICATIONS,patient,Okay.
1086,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What are you taking?
1086,MEDICATIONS,patient,I take Tylenol.
1086,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Is that only for pain?
1086,MEDICATIONS,patient,Yes it is.
1087,GENHX,doctor,"Thanks, nurse. How are you feeling today, miss? Welcome back to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic. What happened yesterday?"
1087,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was doing fine since last time. My respiratory issues have been great and I have had no major difficulties breathing."
1087,GENHX,doctor,That's good to hear. What happened yesterday that caused you to want to come in so urgently?
1087,GENHX,patient,Yesterday I noticed that I have some back and joint pain.  When I breathe deep my back hurts.
1087,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing any coughing?
1087,GENHX,patient,"No, coughing at this moment."
1087,GENHX,doctor,Have you been producing any mucus the times that you do cough?
1087,GENHX,patient,"No, I already said I didn't cough."
1087,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Any fevers or chills?
1087,GENHX,patient,Nothing so far.
1087,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any other symptoms currently?
1087,GENHX,patient,I do notice that I am more tired than usual.
1087,GENHX,doctor,During physical activity do you seem out of breath or more tired than usual? I want to see if your pulmonary system is inhibited.
1087,GENHX,patient,No. I don't have issues with breathing when I do daily activities.
1088,GENHX,doctor,"Hello sir, it's been a while since your last visit. How have you been?"
1088,GENHX,patient,"Hello doctor, yes, I have come a long way. I guess last time I was here was in two thousand and two if I am not wrong. Was does your system say?"
1088,GENHX,doctor,You are right! It was August second of two thousand and two to be very precise.
1088,GENHX,doctor,"Please confirm for the records, you are a white married man and must be forty nine years old now. Am I right?"
1088,GENHX,patient,You got it all right doctor!
1088,GENHX,doctor,Are you still working in that airplane company?
1088,GENHX,patient,"Yes sir, still with Alaska Airlines but I have been promoted and work as a plane mechanic."
1088,GENHX,doctor,"That is so nice! Good for you man! So, tell me how can I help you today? What brought you to our dermatology department today?"
1088,GENHX,patient,I'm having pain in my stomach on the right side and down here.
1088,GENHX,doctor,Is it only on the right side or anywhere else?
1088,GENHX,patient,It is on both sides and now I can feel it on the middle part of my left thigh as well.
1088,GENHX,doctor,Tell me more about it. How did it start? When did you first notice it?
1088,GENHX,patient,"It's been going on and off. It was not there for a while, but now it is like back again mainly on my tummy, down here. It is painful when I touch it. At first, I thought maybe I'm having shingles."
1088,GENHX,doctor,When did you notice it?
1088,GENHX,patient,"It all started before the holidays, I think one and a half months before the holidays. It is still going on for the past eight days in my tummy and the hips mainly on the right side."
1088,GENHX,doctor,Did you get any treatment for this? Any over the counter medicines?
1088,GENHX,patient,"No, as I told you I thought it was shingles, but then there was no change in the skin, no rashes, nothing. I was not sure what to take."
1088,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, do you bathe every day?"
1088,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I do but I try to use as little soap as possible."
1088,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, here is what I think, all your symptoms are pointing towards hyperesthesia. I would like to run some tests to find the underlying cause and then we will start the treatment. A nurse will come and take you to the lab. Does this sound good to you?"
1088,GENHX,patient,Yes.
1089,IMAGING,doctor,Are you finished with your cancer treatments?
1089,IMAGING,patient,Yes.  I am in remission now.
1089,IMAGING,doctor,That is great! When was your last radiation treatment?
1089,IMAGING,patient,It has been over two years since my last treatment.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yeah. I smoke about a pack a day.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you have any plans of quitting?
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Eh not really.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"As your doctor, I'd advise that you consider nicotine patches and find ways to break your smoking habit."
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay. I'll see what I can do.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you drink?
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Socially.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, but I have two littles ones."
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Aw, how old are they?"
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have a four year old and a six year old.
1090,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's great. I'm sure they keep you busy. Any hobbies?
1090,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"They really do, especially the four year old. As for hobbies, I like fixing up computers. I also like fishing, hiking, and camping with the family."
1091,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. Before we begin today, can you confirm your age for me?"
1091,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, doctor. Sure, I'm seventy nine years old."
1091,GENHX,doctor,"Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am?"
1091,GENHX,patient,"Well, I have this arthritis, as you know."
1091,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, how would you describe your arthritis?"
1091,GENHX,patient,"Well, at this point I'd say it's debilitating."
1091,GENHX,doctor,"I see, so the antiinflammatories and rest haven't helped at all?"
1091,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't had any improvement, doctor. It's still so bad."
1091,GENHX,doctor,"I see, I believe you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement."
1091,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I thought so. What are the risks of infection for the surgery?"
1091,GENHX,doctor,"Um, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
1091,GENHX,patient,"That's great, what about anesthesia, will I be asleep for this?"
1091,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
1091,GENHX,patient,"Great, yes, I'd like to do the surgery, doctor."
1092,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome to the clinic.
1092,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you.
1092,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you from the area?
1092,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was born and raised in Iowa. My husband and I moved here twenty years ago, and we have been here ever since."
1092,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,It is a wonderful city. Do you have kids?
1092,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes! We have two kids.
1092,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Do you have any history or present use of tobacco, alcohol and recreational drugs or substances?"
1092,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I have a glass of wine every once and a while but no to the rest.
1093,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any of your family members have issues like seizures?
1093,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"None on my father's side, but, yeah, on my mom's side some of the family members had seizures. Like, my mom had them during her childhood. I know that my great grandmother had it and so does my great aunt."
1094,ROS,doctor,"Do you have a sore throat, cough or earache?"
1094,ROS,patient,No.
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Can you tell me what are the diseases you have been diagnosed with in the past?
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Sure, I have had hypertension, diabetes, asthma and cholesterol problem."
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Ok, is there anything else?"
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Nope.
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"And it is type two diabetes, right?"
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes.
1095,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Thank you!
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir. Do you remember the details of your surgery?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"No, can you remind me?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Well, um, we did a right orchiectomy due to your testicular cancer, when did you have that?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um, it was about eighteen years ago now, so that was about nineteen eighty nine."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good, while you're here, do you have any other conditions that I should be aware of?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Sure, I have G E R D, and um, I B S."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Thank you, what about allergies, do those bother you?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, unfortunately I have those."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Do you have them in the spring, or in the fall?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Actually, I have them in both. It's really annoying."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What allergy symptoms do you have usually?
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um, another doctor called it a postnasal drip."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Okay, yes, I'm familiar with that. Have you ever had any other surgeries?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, um, I had a hernia removed and repaired some time ago."
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"I see, what about any other major medical conditions?"
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I've had carpal tunnel before.
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Which hands did you have it in?
1096,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I've had it in both.
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's me, good morning doctor."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information. How old are you?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"I'm forty four years young, doctor."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Good, thank you. Next, which hand do you write with?"
1097,GENHX,patient,I write with my right hand.
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Finally, what do you do for a living?"
1097,GENHX,patient,I'm an aircraft mechanic.
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands."
1097,GENHX,doctor,How big was the gap that you stepped in?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Um, it was about a foot and a half."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Which knee did you hurt?
1097,GENHX,patient,It was my left knee.
1097,GENHX,doctor,Did you have surgery after the accident?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, yes, I see."
1097,GENHX,patient,"Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any imaging of this knee?
1097,GENHX,patient,"I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Can I see that report?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes absolutely, here."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality."
1097,GENHX,patient,What does that mean?
1097,GENHX,doctor,"There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment."
1097,GENHX,patient,"Oh, thank you, that's good."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery?"
1097,GENHX,patient,I've done a full course of PT for this.
1097,GENHX,doctor,Where is your knee pain?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain go down your leg at all?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur?"
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, that's the femur."
1097,GENHX,patient,"Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Does it go into your thigh at all?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Do you feel anything in the feet?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any back pain?
1097,GENHX,patient,"A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Does anything make your knee pain worse?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad."
1097,GENHX,doctor,What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
1097,GENHX,patient,"I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing out of the ordinary there."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Is there any instability?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and there's pain with it too."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Are you working right now?
1097,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm not right now."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Any allergies I should know about?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain."
1097,GENHX,doctor,That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain?
1097,GENHX,patient,"I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, does the pain wake you up at night?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it does occasionally."
1097,GENHX,doctor,Does anything make this feel better?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too."
1097,GENHX,doctor,What about at its worst?
1097,GENHX,patient,"Easily, its ten out of ten."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?"
1097,GENHX,patient,"Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here."
1097,GENHX,doctor,"Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities. That's good."
1098,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
1098,GENHX,patient,I'm eighty six years old.
1098,GENHX,doctor,What gender do you identify with?
1098,GENHX,patient,I identify as a female.
1098,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had this back and buttock pain?
1098,GENHX,patient,"Its been a while, now. I know I have a fracture in my lower back."
1098,GENHX,doctor,How have you been managing this?
1098,GENHX,patient,"Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories."
1098,GENHX,doctor,Has there been any improvement?
1098,GENHX,patient,"Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain."
1098,GENHX,doctor,"This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete."
1098,GENHX,patient,What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain.
1098,GENHX,doctor,I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty.
1098,GENHX,patient,What's that?
1098,GENHX,doctor,"It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure."
1098,GENHX,patient,"Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?"
1098,GENHX,doctor,"Very low, historically, they're less than one percent."
1098,GENHX,patient,How is this possible?
1098,GENHX,doctor,We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection.
1098,GENHX,patient,"That's great, will I be under anesthesia?"
1098,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing."
1098,GENHX,patient,"Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain."
1098,GENHX,doctor,"Awesome, I agree. Do you have control over your bladder and bowel movements?"
1098,GENHX,patient,"Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still."
1098,GENHX,doctor,Do you wear a brace or corset normally?
1098,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I usually wear both."
1098,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, last question, can you notice any weakness in your body?"
1098,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm still very strong, even at my age."
1099,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir, and who's the patient today? You, or your daughter?"
1099,GENHX,doctor,"And how old are you, dear?"
1099,GENHX,patient,I'm eighteen.
1099,GENHX,doctor,What seems to be the problem today?
1099,GENHX,patient,"I hurt my right knee while playing tennis, um, it was about three days ago now. It really hurts."
1099,GENHX,doctor,"I see, tennis, huh? Was there any contact involved?"
1099,GENHX,patient,"No, I took a step wrong when I went for an awkward shot."
1099,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to stand on this knee?
1099,GENHX,patient,"Not well, it feels unstable, like I'm going to fall over."
1099,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever hurt this knee before?
1099,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, tore my ACL in two thousand eight."
1099,GENHX,doctor,I assume you had surgery for that?
1099,GENHX,patient,"Yeah I did, um, with Doctor X. He called it an, um, A C L reconstruction."
1099,GENHX,doctor,How did you recover from this?
1099,GENHX,doctor,What did they do about that?
1099,GENHX,doctor,When was that done?
1099,GENHX,doctor,"Following the revision, how did you cover?"
1099,GENHX,patient,"I did everything they said, I did it exactly as they wanted, and I did fine until this last injury."
1099,GENHX,doctor,"Good, was there any instability following the revision?"
1099,GENHX,patient,"Nope, I was really stable."
1100,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,How're you feeling today?
1100,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Much better. The antibiotics seemed to really help.
1100,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Are you still experiencing any symptoms?
1100,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Um no, thankfully. I had some wheezing when I first started the antibiotics, but it's improved a ton. I don't think the wheeze is even there anymore."
1100,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good, good."
1101,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any medical problems that run in the family?
1101,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, nothing that comes to mind."
1102,GENHX,doctor,"Hi Mister B, nurse tells me you had a fall?"
1102,GENHX,patient,"Yes, a pretty bad one."
1102,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, tell me what happened?"
1102,GENHX,patient,"Well, I was running to catch a taxi and stumbled upon a piece of rock, lost my balance and fell."
1102,GENHX,patient,I fell face down and my head hit the sidewalk. The next thing I remember is I am all dazed and people trying to help me.
1102,GENHX,doctor,"I see, did you lose consciousness after the fall?"
1102,GENHX,patient,No.
1102,GENHX,doctor,"So, is your head hurting?"
1102,GENHX,patient,Only the right forehead where I have the scrape and my chin.
1102,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, any neck or back pain?"
1102,GENHX,patient,No.
1102,GENHX,doctor,Any stomach pain?
1102,GENHX,patient,No.
1102,GENHX,doctor,"Pain anywhere else, in extremities, hand or leg?"
1102,GENHX,patient,No.
1102,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and how old are you?"
1102,GENHX,patient,I am forty two.
1102,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
1103,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let's talk about your family history.
1103,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay.
1103,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Can you tell me about any kind of medical traits that run in your family?
1103,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I think my family has been blessed or I don't know if any.
1103,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about any heart disease?
1103,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope. No heart disease or diabetes or any other kind of issues that I'm aware of.
1104,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, Nurse. Could you give me a run down on the eleven month old patient?"
1104,GENHX,doctor,Great. Did he have a follow up after?
1104,GENHX,doctor,Did he receive any chemotherapy?
1104,GENHX,doctor,What did they do after chemotherapy?
1104,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, Nurse. I'll go talk to the mother."
1104,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, ma'am. It's nice to see you again. How is your little boy doing?"
1104,GENHX,doctor,Is it getting worse?
1104,GENHX,doctor,That's good to hear. Has he been sick or had any fevers?
1104,GENHX,doctor,Has he been able to eat anything?
1104,GENHX,doctor,Does he still have a reduced appetite?
1104,GENHX,doctor,Did he have any nausea or vomiting after he ate?
1104,GENHX,doctor,"That's great. Is he able to pee and poop fine? No diarrhea, right?"
1104,GENHX,doctor,Great. Would you be able to open his mouth for me? I just want to check if everything's fine inside.
1104,GENHX,patient,Ah.
1104,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Oh, wow. It looks like he's showing some symptoms of thrush again."
1104,GENHX,doctor,It's just a fungal infection inside the mouth. I'll prescribe him fluconazole. It should get rid of it.
1105,GENHX,doctor,"So, how are long have you had pain in this hip?"
1105,GENHX,patient,It's been about eight or ten years now. It began while I was working in construction.
1105,GENHX,doctor,How old are you now?
1105,GENHX,patient,"I'm thirty two now, so I've been in pain since I was in my twenties."
1105,GENHX,doctor,"Have you seen another doctor for this, or am I the first?"
1105,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, um, I've actually seen several doctors before, the last I saw was Doctor A B C a few weeks ago."
1105,GENHX,doctor,What did those doctors tell you?
1105,GENHX,patient,"They thought it was low back pain, and something called, um, radiculopathy."
1105,GENHX,doctor,Does your pain radiate into your legs?
1105,GENHX,patient,Yes.
1105,GENHX,doctor,"Has your pain been present for the eight years, or did it come and go?"
1105,GENHX,patient,"It's been persistent, and I've had difficulties on and off since then."
1105,GENHX,doctor,Okay. The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you?
1105,GENHX,patient,"He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery."
1105,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested?
1105,GENHX,patient,"Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that."
1105,GENHX,doctor,"I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?"
1105,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to."
1105,GENHX,doctor,"Besides the pain medication, have you had anything else?"
1105,GENHX,patient,I've taken antibiotic steroids before.
1105,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Do you drink?
1105,GENHX,patient,"Yes, a lot."
1106,EXAM,doctor,Let me examine your skin.
1106,EXAM,patient,Sure.
1106,EXAM,doctor,It looks normal and well hydrated. Any excessive sweating?
1106,EXAM,patient,"No, not really."
1106,EXAM,doctor,I don't see any injury or wounds.
1106,EXAM,patient,Yeah.
1106,EXAM,doctor,Its just a normal protocol to ask these questions for every new patient.
1106,EXAM,patient,I understand.
1106,EXAM,doctor,Thank you for your cooperation.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Hi there! I am Doctor Kirkland.
1107,GENHX,patient,Hi.
1107,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling?
1107,GENHX,patient,I feel weird. Like I feel confused. I don't know how I got here.
1107,GENHX,doctor,That's okay. Do you remember what happened to you before you came here?
1107,GENHX,patient,No.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Can you tell me about your past medical history?
1107,GENHX,patient,Um.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Take your time.
1107,GENHX,patient,I can't think of what it is called. It's something to do with my brain.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
1107,GENHX,patient,My doctor knows what it is.
1107,GENHX,doctor,What is the name of your doctor?
1107,GENHX,patient,Doctor Frank.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Doctor X? Across the street?
1107,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that is his name. I don't know if that is across the street or not."
1107,GENHX,doctor,I will have your nurse give him a call and get some background information from him.
1107,GENHX,patient,Okay.
1107,GENHX,doctor,Can you please give Doctor X a call and get mister Jones' medical history?
1107,GENHX,doctor,Thank you.
1108,ROS,doctor,Any issues from head to toe?
1108,ROS,patient,"No, everything is fine."
1109,CC,doctor,"Hello, it's been two months already?"
1109,CC,patient,I know right?
1109,CC,doctor,Just feels like yesterday.
1110,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me about your family medical history.
1110,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No one in my family has any health problems.
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And are you working? What do you do?
1111,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, I am a catholic priest!"
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Oh wow!
1111,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes.
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And if you don't mind me asking, do you drink alcohol?"
1111,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Maybe that is something for my confession box but jokes apart I don't drink.
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Sorry I need to ask these questions it's a protocol.
1111,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I understand.
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,And can I put down here that you don't smoke or use any kinds of drugs?
1111,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I don't do those either."
1111,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Cool.
1112,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, so where do you live?"
1112,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I live at an old age nursing home.
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"So, he is Arjun, and he is thirty seven years old and was complaining of chest pain."
1113,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Hi Doctors, how are you?"
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,We are good thanks for asking.
1113,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yep.
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Yeah. I am suspecting coronary spasm but that's questionable.
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,I did run a cardiac enzyme profile and it was negative.
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yes, he does."
1113,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"I did, it is normal too."
1113,ASSESSMENT,patient,Thank you.
1114,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you live in the area?"
1114,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, my husband and I have lived here for a long time. He died a few years back."
1114,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that.
1114,FAM/SOCHX,patient,It's alright.
1114,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke or drink?
1114,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't."
1114,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you use any illicit drugs or substances?
1114,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't do anything like that."
1115,GENHX,patient,"Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day."
1115,GENHX,doctor,Does this help the pain?
1115,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm still in pretty significant pain, doctor."
1115,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, sir. My nurse's chart says that you're thirty four years old. Is that correct?"
1115,GENHX,patient,"Yes, doctor, that's correct."
1115,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had this back pain?
1115,GENHX,patient,"Well, it's been a while now."
1115,GENHX,doctor,Does the pain go into your legs?
1115,GENHX,patient,"Yes, into the left leg, more towards the outside of my leg."
1115,GENHX,doctor,Is there any injury that started this pain?
1115,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I was lifting at work on August twenty seventh two thousand three when I lifted something and felt a pretty sharp pain from my back down into my left leg."
1115,GENHX,doctor,Have you had back pain or surgeries before this injury?
1115,GENHX,patient,"No, I haven't."
1115,GENHX,doctor,Are you having weakness in the legs?
1115,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I am."
1115,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, I believe you are a good candidate for surgery, sir. It seems like you have a lot of weakness and pain in the S one nerve root distribution."
1115,GENHX,patient,Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?
1115,GENHX,doctor,"Overall, the risk of infection is very low, less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time."
1115,GENHX,patient,Will I be asleep for the surgery?
1115,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you'll be under anesthesia. You won't feel a thing."
1115,GENHX,patient,"Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery."
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?"
1116,GENHX,patient,I'm twenty five years old.
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,What kind of procedures were done to address it?
1116,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct."
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Were there any findings, Doctor X?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture?
1116,GENHX,patient,That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
1116,GENHX,doctor,Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct?"
1116,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked."
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,Could you explain what it says?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,What lupus serologies were used?
1116,GENHX,doctor,How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look?
1116,GENHX,doctor,I see. Was there anything else in the report?
1116,GENHX,doctor,That seems important because of the livedo pattern.
1116,GENHX,doctor,Why did she undergo a C T scan?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"I see. The results came out normal, right?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am?"
1116,GENHX,patient,I tried my best to.
1116,GENHX,doctor,That's good. What was found Doctor X?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,Were there any tests done to confirm this?
1116,GENHX,doctor,Nothing was seen microscopically?
1116,GENHX,doctor,That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance.
1116,GENHX,patient,Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States.
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Is that correct, Doctor X?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit?
1116,GENHX,doctor,This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
1116,GENHX,doctor,What was she places on after?
1116,GENHX,doctor,How were her inflammatory markers after taking it?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am?"
1116,GENHX,patient,My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs.
1116,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,Did they find anything apparent?
1116,GENHX,doctor,What was the plan following that?
1116,GENHX,doctor,Was there any medication prescribed?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else?"
1116,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct."
1116,GENHX,doctor,"That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present."
1116,GENHX,patient,I see. Did you find anything else?
1116,GENHX,doctor,"We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?"
1116,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am?"
1116,GENHX,patient,Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me.
1116,GENHX,doctor,"No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct?"
1116,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness."
1116,GENHX,doctor,"I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight?"
1116,GENHX,patient,That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe.
1116,GENHX,doctor,When did you notice the rashes?
1116,GENHX,patient,"I was skiing, and my face started to swell up."
1116,GENHX,doctor,I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne?
1116,GENHX,patient,No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other.
1116,GENHX,doctor,"The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct?"
1116,GENHX,patient,That's correct.
1116,GENHX,doctor,Is there anything else you would like to ask?
1116,GENHX,patient,I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy.
1116,GENHX,doctor,I'll discus that with you right now.
1116,GENHX,patient,"Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow."
1117,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Anyone sick in your family?
1117,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
1117,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, everyone is healthy?"
1117,FAM/SOCHX,patient,That's right.
1118,GENHX,doctor,"Mister Sunil, your blood pressure is high, and I am noticing this from past two-three times you have been here. It's been constantly high, you are not taking it seriously."
1118,GENHX,patient,"No, nothing like that Doctor! It's been well under control. I have been monitoring at home."
1118,GENHX,doctor,Are you noting your readings? Did you bring it with you?
1118,GENHX,patient,No. I did not get the readings with me but I assure you I am taking care and my B P is normal.
1118,GENHX,doctor,"Well, it's up and I am little bothered by it."
1119,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What is your family medical history?
1119,FAM/SOCHX,patient,My dad had colon cancer.
1119,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Did your dad pass from colon cancer?
1119,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No. They caught it early. He passed away from old age. My mom passed away when she was in her nineties from a stroke.
1119,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I am sorry. Do you have any family history of any neurological disorders like, M S, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or epilepsy?"
1119,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Other then my mom having a stroke, I know of nothing else."
1120,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Hello. I see you're here for a follow up. Did you get your blood work done?
1120,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I did. Here are the results.
1120,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Let me take a look. Oh, wow. It looks like your blood sugar is high. Are you exercising every day?"
1120,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Not really. Is that bad?
1120,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,You are at risk of developing type two diabetes.
1121,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,Have you had ever had surgery?
1121,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Yeah, I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago."
1121,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Thank you, what about any other parts of the body, like your eyes, ears, or nose?"
1121,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Oh yeah, I forgot. I had eye surgery too."
1121,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,"Thank you, think hard, any other surgeries you can remember?"
1121,PASTSURGICAL,patient,"Let me look at my notes, um, it looks like I had a dilation and curettage done some time back, too."
1121,PASTSURGICAL,doctor,I see. Thank you for sharing that with me.
1122,CC,doctor,Hi there! How are you doing?
1122,CC,patient,Um. I am feeing really strange.
1122,CC,doctor,Strange how?
1122,CC,patient,I took Ecstasy over the weekend and I feel weird still. My heart is racing. I feel agitated and have been having waves of sadness. I cannot shake this feeling.
1122,CC,doctor,When did you take the Ecstasy?
1122,CC,patient,On Saturday.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you live alone?
1123,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I do. I lost my husband to prostate cancer last year.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Oh wow. I'm so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. I lost my sister to cervical cancer two years ago. It was one of the hardest experiences of my life.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm sorry for your loss as well. It helps to remember the positive memories you had with them.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yes, definitely. How have you been doing otherwise?"
1123,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Not bad. I've been keeping myself busy with gardening.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Gardening is a great hobby.
1123,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I enjoy it very much. It brings me a lot of peace."
1123,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And as your doctor I have to ask, but any history of alcohol or drug use?"
1123,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No.
1124,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Hello. How are you doing today?
1124,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I feel depressed.
1124,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. What's been happening?
1124,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"My parents were fighting for a long time, and I think they're not together anymore."
1124,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That must be really hard. I'm sorry to hear that they're divorced. Who do you live with right now?
1124,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I usually hop houses. I'll go to my dad's house the first half of the week and spend time with his family. Then, I'll go to my mom's house during the last half of the week."
1124,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,That's nice. Now you can ask for more gifts during Christmas.
1124,FAM/SOCHX,patient,You know what? I never thought about that. That's a really good idea.
1125,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What do you do for a living?
1125,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm a real estate agent.
1125,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How long have you been working in the real estate business?
1125,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Almost twenty years.
1125,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Wow. I know who to go to when I'm looking to buy a house.
1125,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Happy to help.
1125,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,So let's see here. Do you drink or smoke?
1125,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I drink socially, but it's very infrequent."
1125,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"And I have to ask, but any drug use?"
1125,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Nope. Not now, not ever."
1126,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome back in, Miss A."
1126,GENHX,patient,"Thank you, doctor."
1126,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember the information about your operation?
1126,GENHX,patient,"No, not really. Can you remind me?"
1126,GENHX,doctor,"Sure, you had a lap band replacement in January of O nine, and you had a band adjustment."
1126,GENHX,patient,Thank you.
1126,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling today?
1126,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and I had problems with my adjustments before."
1126,GENHX,doctor,Has anything changed since the operation?
1126,GENHX,patient,"Actually, doctor, I was in a car accident a couple weeks ago, and I'm having problems."
1126,GENHX,doctor,What symptoms are you experiencing?
1126,GENHX,patient,I don't feel full.
1126,GENHX,doctor,How is your appetite?
1126,GENHX,patient,"I'm not really hungry, but I also don't feel full. When I get hungry at night I can't wait until the morning to eat. I get so hungry."
1126,GENHX,doctor,Do you eat anything when you feel like this?
1126,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I usually have a candy bar, and that helps some."
1127,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, where do you live?"
1127,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Ah, I now live in an assisted nursing facility."
1127,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Okay, and do you drink or smoke?"
1127,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, neither."
1128,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Any specific medical traits in the family?
1128,FAM/SOCHX,patient,What do you mean by that?
1128,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I meant does anyone in your family or extended family have any medical problems that they were treated for?
1128,FAM/SOCHX,patient,I'm not aware of any such thing in my family.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Welcome in! I am Doctor Madison.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Thank you. It's nice to meet you.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Are you married?

1129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I don't drink."
1129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke cigarettes?
1129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Yes. I know it's bad for me.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How much do you smoke per day?
1129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,About a pack a day.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Okay. I have a lot of tools to help you quit smoking that we can discuss.
1129,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Okay.

1130,PLAN,patient,Okay.
1130,PLAN,doctor,"If you develop a fever greater than one hundred and one point four, chills, nausea, vomiting, or continuing diarrhea please call the office. Also if your incision site becomes red, warm to the touch or has any drainage, call the office."
1130,PLAN,patient,Okay.
1131,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Have you had sinus issues before?
1131,ASSESSMENT,patient,"I am not sure, maybe on and off."
1131,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Because this is more allergic.
1131,ASSESSMENT,patient,Okay.
1131,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"So, we call it allergic rhinitis."
1131,ASSESSMENT,patient,Is it different than sinus infection?
1131,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yes, it's it is different."
1131,ASSESSMENT,patient,Okay.
1132,CC,doctor,She has a rare case of thrombocytopenia. I'd like her to come in for a consult.
1132,CC,doctor,"No, just the thrombocytopenia."
1133,GENHX,doctor,Hi there how are you?
1133,GENHX,patient,I am good no problem at all other than the usual.
1133,GENHX,doctor,And what is that?
1133,GENHX,patient,"You know, some discomfort I have on my right side. I have been feeling that since I had a stroke five years back."
1133,GENHX,doctor,"Right, right. We did an E M G right?"
1133,GENHX,patient,Yes.
1133,GENHX,doctor,And none of the medications we tried are helping?
1133,GENHX,patient,"No, I also saw a neurologist, but nothing is helping"
1133,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, and are you monitoring your sugar regularly?"
1133,GENHX,patient,"Oh yes, Everyday at least two to three times a day."
1133,GENHX,doctor,And how bout insulin dose?
1133,GENHX,patient,"Oh, that I kind of adjust myself."
1133,GENHX,doctor,"Well, I have rechecked all the symptoms and everything looks fine. I don't see anything out of order, but we will keep monitoring."
1133,GENHX,patient,Okay.
1133,GENHX,doctor,And you are not smoking or drinking again are you?
1133,GENHX,patient,"No, not since I had the stroke."
1133,GENHX,doctor,"In the past you had a history of heavy usage of both alcohol and smoking, you need to be careful. You are seventy years old."
1133,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I am taking care of it."
1133,GENHX,doctor,Alright take care then.
1134,MEDICATIONS,doctor,What is the strength of your Omeprazole?
1134,MEDICATIONS,patient,It is forty M G and I take it just once a day.
1134,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Any herbal medication?
1134,MEDICATIONS,patient,No I do not take anything like that.
1135,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, to double check, you have a history of hay fever and asthma, correct?"
1135,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Yes. I was also recently diagnosed with cervical dysplasia. I found out shortly after my last O B G Y N visit.
1135,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,And are you planning to follow up with your O B G Y N in the upcoming months?
1135,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yeah, the next visit is scheduled and everything."
1136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, do you have any family history of arthritis?"
1136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Fortunately, no, not that I know of."
1136,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, as far as you know, no one has had a joint replacement?"
1136,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, it doesn't ring any bells."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Please, tell me about your medical history."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for some time now.
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"I'm sorry, that must be difficult."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Thank you, it is, but I manage."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,What about your joints? How do you move?
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh yes, I have arthritis as well. I also had sciatic pain a long time ago, and a herniated disk."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Have you ever had neurological symptoms, like headaches, blurry vision, or weakness?"
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Actually yes, I have migraines when I'm having my period."
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Thank you, and have you had any surgery in the past?"
1137,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Yes, I had my appendix out."
1138,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any past history of psychiatric treatment of struggles?
1138,GENHX,patient,"I had some extreme fatigue back in nineteen ninety one. I was in therapy for six years. They had me on Prozac. I took in for that whole six years while I was in therapy. When I started the Prozac, I had just started working again. The stress at work was overwhelming."
1138,GENHX,doctor,Was this the first time that you had feelings for fatigue and depression?
1138,GENHX,patient,No. I have always had a little sadness or depressed time in my life but it had been manageable before all the work stress started happening.
1138,GENHX,doctor,How are you feeling these days?
1138,GENHX,patient,I get somewhat sad from time to time but I don't dwell on things anymore.
1138,GENHX,doctor,Do you ever have thoughts of selfharm or suicidal thoughts?
1138,GENHX,patient,No.
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How many other children do you have?
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,How is everyone else doing?
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you live here in Easton?
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, do you have any pets?"
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What, no deer?"
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What grade are you in, young man?"
1139,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm in the second grade, doctor."
1139,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Good, how do you like P E? Are you able to play no problem?"
1139,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I love P E. I don't have any problems there."
1140,GENHX,doctor,So let's start from the beginning.
1140,GENHX,patient,Okay.
1140,GENHX,doctor,"You're seventy nine years old, correct?"
1140,GENHX,patient,Yes.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Right or left handed?
1140,GENHX,patient,Right.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Do you remember when you had your first fall?
1140,GENHX,patient,Hm about a year and a half ago I fell while trying to walk from my bed to the living room.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did you feel lightheaded prior?
1140,GENHX,patient,Uh yeah I did have some lightheadedness and I was a bit confused. I was aware of my surroundings though. My legs just gave out and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.
1140,GENHX,doctor,I see. Did you lose consciousness?
1140,GENHX,patient,"No, thank goodness."
1140,GENHX,patient,Yeah. I was good until my legs gave out on me July third of O eight.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did you experience the same lightheadedness as before?
1140,GENHX,patient,Not this time.
1140,GENHX,patient,I was later diagnosed with pneumonia. The fall was blamed on the pneumonia.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Got it.
1140,GENHX,patient,"To be on the safe side, I started using a walker from then on."
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did you need any type of walking assistance prior to your falls?
1140,GENHX,patient,"Nope. I used to walk about two miles a day before all of this stuff started happening to me. This isn't even the end of it. My legs gave out on me again August O eight. No lightheadedness beforehand, but they did find that I had pneumonia again."
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did rehab help?
1140,GENHX,patient,Yeah. I was able to use my walker after that.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did you return to your previous health?
1140,GENHX,patient,"Uh not really, no. I had another fall in October O eight."
1140,GENHX,doctor,Did they diagnose you with pneumonia again?
1140,GENHX,patient,Yeah. I also had shingles.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Are you currently living at home?
1140,GENHX,patient,I'm living in a Chronic Rehab Unit. I can't use my walker anymore. I'm confined to a wheelchair.
1140,GENHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that.
1140,GENHX,patient,"On top of that, I've noticed that my hands have been numb for the past three weeks."
1140,GENHX,doctor,Is it all of your fingers or only some?
1140,GENHX,patient,All.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the numbness in your fingers?
1140,GENHX,patient,Yes. I feel like I've lost quite a bit of muscle in my hands. They're also much weaker than before. My strength hasn't been the same since July O eight. It's definitely getting worse.
1140,GENHX,doctor,I see.
1140,GENHX,patient,I've had muscle twitching in my legs since August O eight.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Fasciculations?
1140,GENHX,patient,Yes. In my lower legs and thighs.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Any cramping or problems swallowing?
1140,GENHX,patient,No.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Any difficulty breathing?
1140,GENHX,patient,No.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Any constipation or diarrhea?
1140,GENHX,patient,Both actually. It tends to alternate.
1140,GENHX,doctor,But no loss of bowel or bladder control?
1140,GENHX,patient,No. I've noticed that my blood pressure has been out of whack. I also feel like I'm about to faint anytime I stand.
1140,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
1140,GENHX,patient,I don't think I have much feeling in my feet. They feel like sponges.
1140,GENHX,doctor,How long has that been going on?
1140,GENHX,patient,"Uh nine months or so. I lost joint position sense in my feet around that time, too."
1141,PLAN,doctor,Are you still doing water aerobics?
1141,PLAN,patient,"Yeah, I've been hitting the pool five days outta the week."
1141,PLAN,doctor,How're you feeling? Have you noticed any changes in energy and strength?
1141,PLAN,patient,"I feel a bit stronger now compared to when I first started. I'm also way, way more energized."
1142,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any history of chronic pain?
1142,GENHX,patient,I got into a car accident a long time ago and I have always had neck pain.
1142,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Any other pain throughout the body?
1142,GENHX,patient,Sometimes I have back pain.
1142,GENHX,doctor,Okay.
1143,GENHX,doctor,How is your pain today?
1143,GENHX,patient,Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly.
1143,GENHX,doctor,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it?
1143,GENHX,patient,I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable.
1143,GENHX,doctor,Is the pain localized to one area?
1143,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
1143,GENHX,doctor,And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body?
1143,GENHX,patient,Nope.
1143,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all?
1143,GENHX,patient,Not yet.
1143,GENHX,doctor,Any back pain?
1143,GENHX,patient,Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs.
1143,GENHX,doctor,Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain?
1143,GENHX,patient,"No, no pins and needles."
1143,GENHX,doctor,Are you experiencing stiffness in your back?
1143,GENHX,patient,The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.
1143,GENHX,doctor,Has it impacted your sleep at all?
1143,GENHX,patient,"Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now."
1143,GENHX,doctor,This accident sure did a number on you.
1143,GENHX,patient,No kidding.
1143,GENHX,doctor,You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night?
1143,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, it's mostly during the day."
1143,GENHX,doctor,I see.
1143,GENHX,patient,The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair.
1143,GENHX,doctor,"But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct?"
1143,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, correct."
1143,GENHX,doctor,I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment?
1143,GENHX,patient,"A little bit, but not much."
1143,GENHX,doctor,And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same?
1143,GENHX,patient,It's stayed more or less the same.
1143,GENHX,doctor,"And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident?"
1143,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
1144,IMAGING,doctor,I have reviewed your x rays from your emergency room visit. I agree with Doctor Jones that your lungs show no signs of infection or decreased lung capacity.
1144,IMAGING,patient,Okay.
1145,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, how are you doing? What brings you here?"
1145,GENHX,patient,"I think I have allergies. I used to live in Seattle. I had allergies there, but I think they're getting worse after moving here. You see, I'm twenty three and I am a white female. I was in Seattle, I thought that the weather there is not for me. That's why I plan to move on here, but my allergies are not leaving me here either."
1145,GENHX,doctor,What did you take for your allergies before?
1145,GENHX,patient,Claritin and Zyrtec.
1145,GENHX,doctor,How effective were they?
1145,GENHX,patient,"They seemed to be working for some time, but now I feel like nothing is effective anymore."
1145,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever tried Allegra?
1145,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I tried that last summer and I've started it again like two weeks ago. But again, the story is the same. They work for some time and now it doesn't seem to be working anymore."
1145,GENHX,doctor,Have you tried sprays?
1145,GENHX,patient,I did use some over the counter ones. But I never got any prescribed nasal spray.
1145,GENHX,doctor,Any other medically related history that I should be aware of?
1145,GENHX,patient,I do have asthma if that counts.
1145,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking any medications for your asthma?
1145,GENHX,patient,"Nope, nothing on the regular basis."
1145,GENHX,doctor,Do you think it is your asthma that is flaring up?
1145,GENHX,patient,"I don't think so. I think, I still think it is just some allergies. I want to get tested."
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, ma'am."
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,Good afternoon doctor.
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"So, do you have any medical conditions I should know about."
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Actually, yes. I have a few. I have hyperthyroidism, and I've had gallbladder issues for some time now."
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,I see. How's your blood pressure?
1146,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,"Oh, um, I have high blood pressure too."
1147,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Are you a smoker, sir?"
1147,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I've been smoking about a pack, to about a pack and a half a day for more than forty years now."
1147,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"What about alcohol, do you drink?"
1147,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, I drink a six pack of beer a day, doctor."
1147,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about drugs? Do you use any illicit substances?
1147,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I never used anything like that."
1148,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,I'd like her to come see you for a consult tomorrow.
1148,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,About five years now.
1148,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Not since moving here.
1149,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, sir, are you married?"
1149,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, I'm married to my lovely wife."
1149,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"That's great, so, what did you do for a living?"
1149,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I was a Pepsi Cola truck driver, but thankfully, I'm retired."
1149,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Congratulations on your retirement. What seems to be the problem today then?
1149,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Thank you, it's nice to be done with that. The years took their toll though, I have a lot of pain in my back and knees."
1149,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Ah, yes, those years of sitting and lifting eventually catch up to everyone."
1150,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Tell me about your family medical history.
1150,FAM/SOCHX,patient,The only thing that I know about is that my grandma has diabetes.
1151,EXAM,doctor,"Hello, Mister G, how are you today?"
1151,EXAM,patient,I am good doctor thank you for asking. I am here to talk to you about my will.
1151,EXAM,doctor,"Yeah, nurse informed me. So, tell me how can I help you?"
1151,EXAM,patient,As you know I have terminal cancer. I have decided I do not want to be resuscitated. I have appointed my daughter as my legal healthcare proxy and she respects my wish.
1151,EXAM,doctor,Tell me what I can do to make you comfortable?
1151,EXAM,patient,"Honestly doctor you have done enough and I am so thankful for that. I just wish to spend my last days at home surrounded with loved ones. I have my nurse, she takes care of me. I think I am fine!"
1151,EXAM,doctor,Alright my friend.
1152,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you smoke?
1152,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
1152,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about alcohol? Or any kind of drugs?
1152,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Nope.
1153,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,"History of any illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?"
1153,PASTMEDICALHX,patient,I dislocated my wrist when I was a kid but that's all.
1154,ROS,doctor,Any pain while peeing?
1154,ROS,patient,No.
1154,ROS,doctor,Any change in frequency or feeling the urgency to pee?

1155,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yes, my dad and brother had heart vessel blockage type of disease in their forties."
1156,GENHX,doctor,"If I'm understanding correctly, you sustained an elbow injury during a fight with some other kids in Juvenile Hall?"
1156,GENHX,patient,Yeah. My left elbow is killing me.
1156,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
1156,GENHX,patient,Seventeen.
1156,GENHX,doctor,Are you having pain anywhere else?
1156,GENHX,patient,Yeah. My left ankle also hurts.
1156,GENHX,doctor,Are you able to walk without difficulty?
1156,GENHX,patient,Yeah.
1156,GENHX,doctor,Any knee pain?
1156,GENHX,patient,"Not right now, but I've had left knee pain in the past."
1156,GENHX,doctor,Did you pass out or hurt your neck in any way?
1156,GENHX,patient,I didn't pass out. I hit my head against the floor when one of the kids tried to pin me down.
1156,GENHX,doctor,"Do you have a headache, nausea, or blurry vision?"
1156,GENHX,patient,No.
1156,GENHX,doctor,And no chest or abdominal pain?
1156,GENHX,patient,No.
1156,GENHX,doctor,Were there any weapons like knives or guns used during the fight?
1156,GENHX,patient,No.
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Hello. Before we begin your visit, I noticed some information missing. Could I verify the information with you?"
1157,FAM/SOCHX,patient,Of course.
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Does your family have a history of any health related problems?
1157,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, yeah. A lot of my family have heart problems and cancer."
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. Do you know what kind of cancer?
1157,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"I'm not completely sure, but my wife may know. She's here with me right now."
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Great. I'll bring her in.
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you know what type of cancer runs in his family?
1157,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Thank you. Sir, are there any other health related problems I should be aware of?"
1157,FAM/SOCHX,patient,High blood pressure and food allergies run in my family too.
1158,GENHX,doctor,Okay I am looking at you for multiple issues today. One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?
1158,GENHX,patient,"Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg."
1158,GENHX,doctor,"How old are you, miss?"
1158,GENHX,patient,I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress.
1158,GENHX,doctor,Did you hurt your shoulder?
1158,GENHX,patient,"No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year."
1158,GENHX,doctor,Ok let's look at your labs.
1158,GENHX,patient,"So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up."
1158,GENHX,doctor,Any other complaints?
1158,GENHX,patient,"I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds."
1158,GENHX,doctor,"Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed."
1158,GENHX,patient,"Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it."
1158,GENHX,doctor,How about chest pain or shortness of breath?
1158,GENHX,patient,"No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath."
1158,GENHX,doctor,What work you do?

1163,GENHX,doctor,We have been currently treating your rheumatoid arthritis with methotrexate. How much have you been taking?
1163,GENHX,patient,"Yes, we have tried lots of different treatments and methotrexate has been working well.  I have been on it for ten years now. I have been taking about twenty or twenty five M G of per week."
1163,GENHX,doctor,Did we recently increase your dosage? I see in your chart that we have changed your dosage a few times.
1163,GENHX,patient,About a year ago we lowered the dosage for twenty five M G to twenty but my arthritis flared up so we went to twenty two point five.
1163,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had any side effects from the methotrexate in the past?
1163,GENHX,patient,No. I don't think so.
1163,GENHX,doctor,Are you taking any other medications?
1163,GENHX,patient,I had a sinus infection and the doctor put me on an antibiotic. That was about two weeks ago.
1163,GENHX,doctor,Do you know what the antibiotic the doctor gave you?
1163,GENHX,patient,"I don't remember the name of the antibiotic, but I know that I have taken antibiotics before and I didn't have a problem."

1164,GENHX,doctor,"Hello, miss. How are you feeling today?"
1164,GENHX,patient,Terrible. My allergies are killing me right now.
1164,GENHX,doctor,Do you have a history of allergies?
1164,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I do. I had them all the time when I lived in Seattle, but they got a lot worse when I moved here. I am a strong German woman and I hate how something as little as allergies gets the best of me."
1164,GENHX,doctor,Why did you move here?
1164,GENHX,patient,I wanted to experience different cities since I'm only twenty three.
1164,GENHX,doctor,That sounds exciting. Back to your allergies now. Do you take any medication to relieve your symptoms?
1164,GENHX,patient,Here's a list of past and current medications I'm taking.
1164,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you. Let me take a look. I see you took Claritin and Zyrtec in the past, correct? Did those help you?"
1164,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, that's correct. They were working for a bit, but then they stopped working after a while."
1164,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Your notes say you took Allegra after, correct?"
1164,GENHX,patient,"Correct. I tried out Allegra last summer, but I don't know if it was doing its job. I tried it again two weeks ago because my allergies were getting bad, but it still didn't work."
1164,GENHX,doctor,"I see. Your notes state you've tried some nasal sprays, correct?"
1164,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I did. I wanted to see if they would work."
1164,GENHX,doctor,Were you prescribed these nasal sprays?
1164,GENHX,patient,Nope. I bought them at my local pharmacy.
1164,GENHX,doctor,"Sounds good. I'm looking at your medical history, and it sates here you have asthma too, correct?"
1164,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I've had it for a long time, but it hasn't gotten worse."
1164,GENHX,doctor,I see. Do you think you need any medication to help alleviated your asthma?
1164,GENHX,patient,No. It doesn't bother me as much as my allergies.
1165,EXAM,doctor,How are you doing young man?
1165,EXAM,patient,I'm good. Thank you.
1165,EXAM,doctor,Let's see how your chest is doing.
1165,EXAM,patient,Okay.
1165,EXAM,doctor,"Chest measurements look nice. No issue there. The outline also looks great. Also, there is no hunchback?"
1166,GENHX,doctor,I see here that Doctor-
1166,GENHX,patient,"Yes, Doctor X referred me. My thyroid is an absolute mess. I have never been in so much pain in my seventy one years."
1166,GENHX,doctor,I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope we're able to get you the care that you need.
1166,GENHX,patient,I've been coughing up a storm. It's gotten to be way too enlarged.
1166,GENHX,doctor,It's good that you're here today to get the surgery rolling.
1166,GENHX,patient,I signed the paperwork and everything.
1166,GENHX,doctor,I'll go over the risk and benefits one more time. Any questions for me?
1166,GENHX,patient,When is the earliest I can get this done again?
1166,GENHX,doctor,"Given your symptoms, I'd like to get you in in the next few days."
1167,ALLERGY,doctor,Are you allergic to any medications?

1168,ALLERGY,doctor,I see here that you're allergic to grapefruit and peanuts. Do you happen to be allergic to any medications you've taken in the past?
1168,ALLERGY,patient,"Nah, just allergic to grapefruit and peanuts."
1168,ALLERGY,doctor,Gotcha. Do you carry an Epi pen around with you?
1168,ALLERGY,patient,I try to bring it with me everywhere I go.
1169,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, tell me about your family, any illness or anything that runs in the family."

1170,PASTMEDICALHX,doctor,Any medical issues in the past?

1171,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Who else is there in the family?

1172,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So, tell me something, does asthma run in your family?"
1172,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I think I am the only one who has it. Even my parents were surprised when I developed it, as no one else has it."
1172,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Yeah, it happens."
1173,GENHX,doctor,"Welcome in, sir. I am Doctor Gray."
1173,GENHX,patient,Thank you. It's nice to meet you.
1173,GENHX,doctor,What is your past medical history?
1173,GENHX,patient,I had surgery on my shoulder thirteen years ago and after the surgery I lost my sense of smell. I still can't smell. I also can't see very well in my right eye.
1173,GENHX,doctor,How old are you?
1173,GENHX,patient,I am seventy six.
1173,GENHX,doctor,Do you get headaches?
1173,GENHX,patient,No.
1173,GENHX,doctor,Do you have any nasal drainage?

1175,MEDICATIONS,doctor,Okay.
1176,GENHX,doctor,"Good afternoon, sir. Did you see the nurse already?"
1176,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I just saw her."
1176,GENHX,doctor,"Great, you're seventy eight years old, correct?"
1176,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I'm not as young as I used to be."
1176,GENHX,doctor,"Who is? What seems to be the problem today, sir?"
1176,GENHX,patient,"I have right hand pain, and it's been there for a while now."
1176,GENHX,doctor,Are you having numbness sir?
1176,GENHX,patient,"Yes, and I can't move it very well, either."
1176,GENHX,doctor,Which fingers are you having these symptoms in?
1176,GENHX,patient,"Well, I told you it's all in the right hand, but it's in the index and middle fingers."
1176,GENHX,doctor,Are your fingers catching?
1176,GENHX,patient,"What does that mean, doctor?"
1176,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any problems extending your fingers?
1176,GENHX,patient,"Yes, they seem to lock up when I try to extend my fingers."

1176,GENHX,doctor,What treatments have you had for this?
1176,GENHX,patient,I only had an injection so far.
1176,GENHX,doctor,Did this help at all?
1176,GENHX,patient,"Well, some, but it was really only temporary relief. Is there surgery for this?"
1176,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, I think you'd be a good candidate for surgery."
1176,GENHX,patient,What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
1176,GENHX,doctor,It's less than one percent. We use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time.
1176,GENHX,patient,"Even though it's on my hand, will I be asleep for this procedure?"
1176,GENHX,doctor,"Yes, you won't feel a thing."
1176,GENHX,patient,"Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery."

1177,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, I've never smoked. I have tried a beer once, but I never liked it."
1177,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,What about drugs?
1177,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"No, never did that."
1178,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Are you going to visit rehab?
1178,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes, what choice do I have?"
1178,ASSESSMENT,doctor,"Yes, please do visit Mercy Manor for P T and Rehab."
1178,ASSESSMENT,patient,"Yes, I will."
1178,ASSESSMENT,doctor,That will help your right side hip pain.
1178,ASSESSMENT,patient,I think so too.
1179,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,Can you tell me about your Immunizations?
1179,IMMUNIZATIONS,patient,"Yeah, I had them all."
1179,IMMUNIZATIONS,doctor,"Good, looks like you are up to date."
1180,GENHX,doctor,Welcome back to the clinic. How are you feeling today?
1180,GENHX,patient,Thank you. I am doing better.
1180,GENHX,doctor,It looks like we are following up on your severe osteoarthritis in both knees. And you also have been experiencing some flexion contracture limitations.
1180,GENHX,patient,Um hum.
1180,GENHX,doctor,How is your physical therapy going?
1180,GENHX,patient,It is going really well. She kicks my butt but it seems to be helping. Doing my exercises at home is really helping.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Were you not doing them in the beginning?
1180,GENHX,patient,"No, I wasn't. She got on me to start doing them and I have definitely seen the difference."
1180,GENHX,doctor,Have you experienced any worsening of pain since you were last seen?
1180,GENHX,patient,"Well, the right knee is worse than the left? It mostly hurts after physical therapy."
1180,GENHX,doctor,Can you describe what the pain feels like?
1180,GENHX,patient,It feels achy.
1180,GENHX,doctor,"Is it a continuous pain, or?"
1180,GENHX,patient,No. It is not all the time. Every once and a while. It feels stiff all the time.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Any weakness or instability?
1180,GENHX,patient,No.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Any burning sensations associated with the pain?
1180,GENHX,patient,No.
1180,GENHX,doctor,How long have you been dealing with this?
1180,GENHX,patient,Several months.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Have you had any trouble sleeping?
1180,GENHX,patient,No. When I sit down or lie down at night there's no pain.
1180,GENHX,doctor,"So, the pain is when you are weight bearing, right?"
1180,GENHX,patient,Yeah. And it hurts when I move around. It makes it difficult to do things.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Have you noticed any pain with the cold weather change?
1180,GENHX,patient,"No, I have not noticed anything."
1180,GENHX,doctor,I am just going to take a look here.
1180,GENHX,patient,Okay.
1180,GENHX,doctor,I don't see any swelling or redness. And I don't feel any warmth coming from the area. Have you noticed any of these symptoms?
1180,GENHX,patient,Nope.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Any radiating pain through the knees here?
1180,GENHX,patient,No.
1180,GENHX,doctor,Any pain any where else in the body?
1180,GENHX,patient,"No, just the knees."
1180,GENHX,doctor,"So, no pain in the hips or back?"
1180,GENHX,patient,Nope.
1181,GENHX,doctor,"Hi, what is going on?"
1181,GENHX,doctor,"We see this a lot at A B C Medical Center. I am glad you came. You just saw Doctor H, right?"
1181,GENHX,doctor,Okay. Where is she living? With you?
1181,GENHX,doctor,"Ma'am, do you have headache or chest pain?"
1181,GENHX,patient,What? What? Huh?
1181,GENHX,doctor,Ma'am. Do you have vision issues?
1181,GENHX,patient,What? I can see. Of course I can see.
1181,GENHX,doctor,Any shortness of breath?
1181,GENHX,doctor,Have your symptoms improved at all? Or have they worsened since this morning?
1182,ASSESSMENT,doctor,I think you have a muscular strain.
1182,ASSESSMENT,patient,Yeah.
1182,ASSESSMENT,doctor,So right side shoulder strain and maybe a little bit of nerve compression.
1182,ASSESSMENT,patient,Oh really!
1182,ASSESSMENT,doctor,Maybe. I will do further evaluation and treatment.
1182,ASSESSMENT,patient,Okay.
1183,GENHX,doctor,"Can you tell me more about your daughter, ma'am?"
1183,GENHX,doctor,Has she ever had surgery?
1183,GENHX,doctor,When was her last surgery?
1183,GENHX,doctor,How did she do following the second surgery?
1183,GENHX,doctor,"So, what brings you in for a visit today?"
1183,GENHX,patient,"Well, I've been having some leg pain on the side of my legs."
1183,GENHX,doctor,How long have you had this pain?
1183,GENHX,patient,It's been several months at this point.
1183,GENHX,doctor,When is your pain the worst?
1183,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's the worst at night, I have to take medicine for the pain."
1183,GENHX,doctor,What do you take?
1183,GENHX,doctor,"Wow, that's a lot. Looks like you have some patch sensory loss in the L four to S one region. Are you going to the bathroom regularly?"
1183,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, there's no problems there. I do have some loss of feeling in my big toe and calf though."
1184,DISPOSITION,doctor,"Well, he has improved clinically but would require acute care."
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please?"
1185,GENHX,patient,"Good morning, I'm sixty five years old, doctor."
1185,GENHX,doctor,How are you recovering from your operation?
1185,GENHX,patient,I'm doing okay. Can you remind me what operation I had?
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Um, we did a left upper lobectomy for your stage I A non small cell lung cancer."
1185,GENHX,patient,"Thank you, doctor."
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Absolutely, do you have the results of your pelvic C T?"
1185,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I have the report right here."
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Thank you, so this shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney."
1185,GENHX,patient,What can we do about this?
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Well, that's why we did the barium swallow, which showed a small hiatal hernia with minimal reflux."
1185,GENHX,patient,"Oh, yeah, I remember that."
1185,GENHX,doctor,"So, I have your x rays from November twenty third two thousand nine here, we did an A P and lateral view, and they're normal."
1185,GENHX,patient,"Oh, well that's good too."
1185,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any pain with swallowing food?
1185,GENHX,patient,"Yes, I get some chest pain, but I'd say it's pretty mild. Look at my calf, doctor, it's much bigger than the right one."
1185,GENHX,doctor,Chest pain is probably due to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying. Is it tender?
1185,GENHX,patient,"No, there's no real tenderness."
1185,GENHX,doctor,How long has this calf been enlarged?
1185,GENHX,patient,"Um, it's been several months at this point."
1185,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever had D V T?
1185,GENHX,patient,"Yes, um, in nineteen seventy five, and in nineteen eighty five."
1185,GENHX,doctor,Are you having any abnormal weight loss?
1185,GENHX,patient,"No, everything is normal there, and I'm eating normally."
1185,GENHX,doctor,What about any cold or flu symptoms? Any fever or chills?
1185,GENHX,patient,"No, that's all fine too."
1185,GENHX,doctor,Any new aches or pains?
1185,GENHX,patient,"No, all my muscles feel pretty good."
1185,GENHX,doctor,"Have you had a cough, or coughed up any blood."
1185,GENHX,patient,"That's a negative, doctor."
1185,GENHX,doctor,What about shortness of breath while at rest or difficulty breathing with exercise?
1185,GENHX,patient,"No, that's normal too. I'm breathing just fine."
1186,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Let's talk about your family's medical history.
1186,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Hm, well both my father and my brother had colon cancer. My daughter was detected with breast cancer."
1186,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Do you remember what her age was?
1186,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Yeah, she was forty."
1186,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,I see. Anything else?
1186,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Well, I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I also had a stroke."

1187,ROS,doctor,Did you notice any blood in urine or painful urination?

1187,ROS,patient,Correct.
1187,ROS,doctor,Everything else looks fine.
1187,ROS,patient,Cool.
1187,ROS,doctor,"Your eyes, nose, and throat look good."
1188,GENHX,doctor,How are you doing miss? How are your sugar numbers coming along?
1188,GENHX,patient,I'm doing good. Thank you. Sugar has consistently been one hundred and thirty five or under it.
1188,GENHX,doctor,How are you checking it?
1188,GENHX,patient,I have a glucose monitor at home I'm using that only.
1188,GENHX,doctor,Nice. Did you eat anything in the morning today?
1188,GENHX,patient,"No, I'm fasting for my test."
1188,GENHX,doctor,"Okay, let's see. We have an Accu Chek here in our office. I will do a quick sugar test for you, and this will be a fasting sugar test. It will be just a quick prick on your finger."
1188,GENHX,patient,Don't worry doctor. I'm used to poking my finger all the time.
1188,GENHX,doctor,Let's see what we got here. Your reading says one hundred and twenty. I will write it down for my record. Are you being active?

1189,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,How did your last visit go with the cardiologist?
1189,DIAGNOSIS,patient,Good.
1189,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,It looks like they diagnosed you with sick sinus syndrome. Do you have any questions about this new diagnosis?
1189,DIAGNOSIS,patient,"No, she explained everything to me. I'm planning to follow-up with her in the next two weeks."
1189,DIAGNOSIS,doctor,Great. So it looks like your past medical history is the same? Nothing new other than the sick sinus syndrome.
1190,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"So Mister J, where do you stay?"
1190,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, I stay at a care facilit. It's very near to your clinic. Have you heard about this place called South Valley Care Center?"

1199,GENHX,doctor,Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
1199,GENHX,patient,"I had, um, tinea pedis before."
1199,GENHX,doctor,How was this treated?
1199,GENHX,patient,They gave me Nizoral cream.
1199,GENHX,doctor,"It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now."
1199,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there."
1199,GENHX,doctor,"What else are you dealing with, sir?"
1199,GENHX,patient,"I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off?"
1199,GENHX,doctor,Have you ever done that before?
1199,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away."
1199,GENHX,doctor,"If we've done it before, we can do it again."
1199,GENHX,patient,"Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate."
1199,GENHX,doctor,"Well, that's called P S A."
1199,GENHX,patient,Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all.
1199,GENHX,doctor,"Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high."
1199,GENHX,patient,"You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it."
1199,GENHX,doctor,"That's good, it's really hard to quit."
1199,GENHX,patient,"Yeah, I tried chewing tobacco, but it's not the same."
1199,GENHX,doctor,Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking.

1200,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"I'm originally from Kentucky. And I have to do the routine ask, but any drinking, smoking, or illicit drug use?"
1200,FAM/SOCHX,patient,No to all of the above.
1200,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,Got it.
1201,FAM/SOCHX,doctor,"Looks like the nurse came in and asked you everything. Ah, she has everything documented here, but I will ask one more time. So, tell me, where do you live?"
1201,FAM/SOCHX,patient,"Oh, it's a senior citizen house. They have many nursing aids there."
