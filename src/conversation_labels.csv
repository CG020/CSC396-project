<doctor> hello looks like we are here for a six months follow up how are we doing alright how are the thyroid issues have you experienced any of the following: temperature intolerance palpitations muscle weakness tremors nausea vomiting constipation or diarrhea how has you weight been any muscle weakness closest to the body's center date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@@ @@@ i think i saw you around …in november something like that right back here have a seat and what brings you in here today regular appointment alright so what uh so we keep an eye on people see how they're doing so anything been bothering you lately what bothers you about your feet and your eyes okay okay uh then you notice there's something there okay @@@ okay uh do you feel like you're kind of on pins and needles yeah pain and how long has this been going on alright okay alright uh do you have any numbness in your feet just kind of pain okay and the pain is it a sharp pain burning pain aching pain aching pain okay right how long does it last in the morning okay yeah any pain in your hands like throughout the day does it hurt again or is it mostly just in the morning and it lasts about 45 minutes 30 45 minutes okay okay and how long would say this has been going on any weakness that you notice in your legs okay and what has been bothering you about the eyes okay uh it's tough to read um as far as your vision when you read okay so if you look at the wall there you can't read the stuff just when you read close um yeah it sounds very typical of if you're reading this do you have to hold it out like this yeah yeah that's okay uh sometimes it's a real busy day and you come in late it's tough to squeeze you in today uh we were able to make it happen so we try to see you if we can and you went to you've been in therapy is that right from the previous cocaine stuff that went okay completed the treatment i understand any problems with temptation recently any use okay when was the last time you used okay and um is there anything we can do to try to keep that from happening again okay alright and they've seen you before so i think you can just go and schedule a schedule with them i'd recommend that you do that we definitely um definitely want to get that um get you to see them again and make sure we're doing everything we can and uh that's something that's gonna affect your health in addition to you know we're worried about your health but it being illegal we don't really care so much about but but it does cause health problem so we need to try to get you off of that cocaine about how frequently have you been using it and the last time i saw you was maybe december or january in november the end of november that i saw you the last time um and then when did you restart okay so you had some time where you were able to avoid it um that's good and i think and actually to get you off of it again and keep you off of it so hopefully working with them again will hopefully get you there um uh-huh @@@ uh you know uh we want what's best for you and to do that we need to know the truth and even if you say even if you don't do what we tell you we want to know about it make sure that we can do everything we can your care so we uh we're not here to pass any judgment we'll just give you advice that's what we do we'll give you advice and if you take it that's great uh-huh uh let's see so it looks like uh you never got the colonoscopy it looks like um is that something you wanted to do now or do you want to hold off for now alright we'll put it back in yeah so the reason we do it is because um once you get above 50 your risk of colon cancer is increased and uh this is the way we can see it early treat it sometimes it's something small which usually it is if we see you regularly they can just take it out and then that'll be the end of it um whereas if it becomes something that we miss um you know maybe you'd be able to go for you know maybe you wouldn't get it during your lifetime and wouldn't have any problems but it you would then it would become advanced and then that causes more problems and it's been shown to be effective in taking care of it early on uh can i take a look at your feet take your shoes and socks off set things up okay where is the pain mostly in the morning oh through there okay um i'm going to poke you with this see if you can feel it yeah feel that feel it there and there feel back here okay okay down here right there get that pain now okay it looks like any pain in here okay it looks like your pain is right over where you've got another one of those calluses um so we'll probably just continue with you seeing them and taking care of that i know they're growing back pretty quick but um oh just keep the only way to to fix it or the only way to understand what it is is take a look at it um alright i'll go talk to the boss and be back in a minute it looks like next month next month um and i'll put in a referral for the eye appointment today for you not sure when that'll be and then i'll put in the order for a colonoscopy class so that i'm not totally sure how that works you can ask them for today uh not sure if they still do that you can ask them at the desk we'll check you out so you know you had an appointment here um but i'm not sure exactly uh not sure exactly how that works now @@@ they may be used to i'm not sure if they still do i'm gonna totally sure to be honest do you use tobacco how much do you smoke and any alcohol use and you haven't had any surgeries in the past is that right alright so they will uh call you about getting they can have you come and talk to the nurse and then they give you the medication for the uh that you have to take before the colonoscopy okay and um and they'll make you an appointment in the eye clinic in a couple weeks hopefully and we'll see you in about six months alright alright take care that's it @@@ you too </doctor> <patient> i have

hip was it so what are they doing about the falls what are we doing to prevent the falls are you now completely in a wheelchair okay are you taking physical therapy okay good that's good good and then going to the bathroom did you set up things in the bathrooms sometimes people use stuff like that okay okay good okay hmm that's good okay so i'm thinking one step at a time coumadin @@@ the last time you were here you were off of it so are you on it now okay no don't worry about it i'll check it okay so the carvedilol oh @@@ you want to have a seat are you okay the carvedilol d 0.1 @@@ the same right uh-huh okay twice a day it says every day here so i will change it to twice a day twice a day and then the insulin are you still on insulin okay okay okay that's fine okay um so he's taking a multivitamin uh-huh so we got to order it omeprazole i’ll order it @@@ so terimosin@@@ is he still taking that it says on here 2mg twice a day is just fine so two of them he takes two of them twice a day right okay good uh okay this is @@@ coumadin or warfarin @@@ because it also looks like he was taken off of it from what i i was reading in his notes he was off of it at one time i'm not sure if it was after the fall maybe okay okay so i'll put that back on how much does he take now okay alright @@@ anything @@@ okay so on the @@@ you don't need any @@@ yeah i was just going to say he can okay okay and then the norvasc uh-huh uh-huh @@@ i'll order today and @@@ 4 mg okay and then @@@ amiodarone @@@ 20 mg once a day okay uh so if he needs @@@ today does he need to go to the pharmacy today or can things be sent to the house okay otherwise okay okay so let's see okay let's see okay now and you're back on dialysis you're back on dialysis okay uh-huh how many times therapy comes to the house home many times a week do you go somewhere for therapy okay how many times a week okay well let's see no chest pain shortness of breath nothing like that good um now the last time you saw the urologist you did a urine test which came back positive he had some; did they ever give you antibiotics for that okay uh-huh okay okay okay okay uh-huh okay you don't have a foley catheter do you when you do urinate there is no pain no burning with urination right okay well again that's the reason why @@@ can have these symptoms and you know i treat the patient not the lab draw @@@ and blood pressures at home how have they been blood pressure checks he takes at home okay that's fine how about your blood sugars okay do you have a log no problem so just because he has a primary care provider in oak park @@@ take the log in to show him uh-huh okay so um that's not as good low sugars are not good so um so if it's something that's consistent you might want to talk to the primary care doctor so that the large dose of aspart might be lowered you can lower that to prevent you from you said it's normally lower than normal is that right his blood sugar is normally lower okay uh-huh the afternoon okay yeah so this @@@ his primary care doctor and then he gives us insulin oh good okay good good okay okay let's see @@@ yeah yes brittle means goes up and comes down he's definitely brittle and unfortunately that’s the hardest type to control but it requires exactly what you're doing testing and doing your logs every day so we can see the inconsistencies and then adjust the insulin for that okay @@@ uh-huh @@@ uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i would ask about alternatives because they know @@@ they have lots of dialysis patients who are diabetes.@@@ uh-huh yeah okay how's your copd yeah the breathing okay no longer taking any inhalers for that and your cardiologist said that you need to take aspirin or plavix and you have @@@ okay and then let's see also did we talk about starting a medication called lisinopril or any medicine that ends with a pril a medication called lisinopril or it's for the heart i think i mentioned it the last time no he'd never been on it i just don't know why he'd never been on this um @@@ does he have heart disease @@@ it helps the heart uh-huh that’s not for the heart uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh yes yes so we'll just check some labs here your blood pressure was perfect today seems pretty regular this time your abnormal heartbeat goes in and out it doesn’t seem like it’s constantly there you had an amputation here you had an amputation here you had an amputation here deep breath one more deep breath let it out deep breath again deep breath good okay it's regular yeah normally it is irregular @@@ coumadin but today its regular the only thing @@@ goes in and out so in some cases people have that it comes in and out so most likely @@@ to see @@@ oh you do oh really now remind me you're not smoker currently were you ever a smoker for how long i'll be back okay okay so here’s what i'm going to do check some labs will you be back again soon no do you have an appointment soon coming up no okay here okay alright i've ordered him the yearly labs for you so do you live far so could you come back just for labs for me no i'll order it and then whenever you can just come in and go straight to the lab and they can just do the blood work and it will come to me and i'll call you if anything is abnormal okay but i ordered his cholesterol so don't eat you know the day before @@@ you're supposed to have fasting blood work don't eat after midnight yeah the day that he has the labs exactly yes you know i don’t get the results of it so that's fine i think we can do it there get it once a year okay yeah the coumadin results we get here but the cholesterol is something needing to be done okay alright so orders so come back and see in six months okay usually don't they send you letters they send letters yeah a letter this is for the check-out okay when they check out they'll give you well whenever you think you can do it within the next two weeks that'll be great within the next two weeks whenever you get the chance just come by to get it in the morning just go to the first floor and draw the blood and then that's it okay i'll get the results and normally no news from me is good news well it depends however you want to do it uh-huh uh-huh is that at loyola just work it out; it's not an emergency that needs to be done yeah so just work all those things out don't stress him out you know make him get here on time all that okay alright okay good seeing you again good luck with your surgery take care let me help you out i want to see you in six months okay @@@ the first of july alright bye bye </doctor> <patient> oh i have high blood pressure but it's well under control i make sure to keep it under normal range yeah i have history of high triglycerides but otherwise i am pretty healthy no hello how are you today um i'm a pretty good kid considering everything that's what they say @@@ can you say okay cookie's okay @@@ yeah that's right two hips were both broken yes either that or my wife pushed me (laughs) well he pushed me to do that (laughs.) i made some notes here you know what; let me pull up the list from home to make sure i get it right you know what i want to call you good call on the carvedilol because um he had a visit with his cardiologist @@@ good and so we had a long discussion about carvedilol when he started that @@@@ a friend of ours is a rep for    carvedilol or coreg and they were told that it does damage to warn people that it could have the same effects of a statin for leaking into the muscle and so we have when he first started taking it and they took him off it for a while and then this last time his primary put him on it well anyay yeah you know what i have a handwritten list uh i did check that list and there are a few omissions that i want to make sure that i didn't yep both of them i mean i fell and i broke one and then i fell again and i broke it july and you broke your left hip and in december he broke his right @@@ well yeah i use a walker and they put weights on it which helps me a lot keeps me steady so you know i'm much better you know i'm more comfortable you know walking with it because it doesn't wobble both of us waddling @@@ we got a power @@@ and we the door taken off of my bathroom so the door is wider but um and @@@ @@@ okay here is what he takes in the morning and you know no it's okay it's all good yeah uh lasix @@@ except the furosemide twice a day uh-huh huh yeah the novolog @@@ yeah you got this changed or somebody did so that it's right now i called and told them the problem that's fine @@@ she was going to order it but it didn't come okay yeah i called on june 12th and they said he couldn't order any more until september that seems to be helping yes yes and i asked them @@@ ahead @@@ hold @@@ because she wanted to have people on coumadin rather than on @@@ but it’s not on @@@ oh he was off of it; he went off of it when he had surgery maybe yeah 2 mg a day @@@ we don't use any but i guess that he could always call when he needs it but @@@ @@@ yes that was um but he had two kinds one he takes on the day for dialysis and then the non-dialysis days @@@ @@@ yeah that was one of the things that we needed a new prescription for @@@ sent to the house @@@ okay good is there anything that you need no @@@ don't you think we were well-organized this time now you can handle the rest of it i do the accounting pardon me uh yes uh wednesday and saturday two times a week he's having some problems with the saturday one he's always sick on sunday and so they cut him back this last saturday right and he seemed to be a little better i do therapy at home anymore i go to oak park hospital uh twice a week two to three times it kind of depends no uh you know what we she sent the report to his primary in oak park because @@@ because the last time that he was in the hospital they said he is carrying a chronic bacteria in his bladder and that it cannot be treated by oral antibiotics and uh he's just going to have to live with it kind of and that occasionally it will cause symptoms and also he was kind of @@@ too i think that night he had chills or something @@@ but uh then he seemed to get over it yeah they did one the last time uh-huh i don't know if i still have @@@ no a foley catheter no no oh sorry no that's something different no uh i haven't taken it and i don't know why yeah you know it's controlled and i guess that's why i got off of you know taking it every day at home @@@ i suppose we should do that we used to do that all the time yeah @@@ well @@@ it kind of got dropped by the way side uh they run crazy you know usually in the morning they can be anywhere from you know 121 to you know 169 sometimes and uh then at afternoon it'll generally be in the 200s with some exceptions it'll be lower than that but most times in the afternoons are the low 200s yep i didn't bring it and uh his sugars in the evening sometimes drop way down they sometimes have you like 68 or 70 or something so then he doesn't take any insulin okay right it's kind of normal in the morning and then @@@  and so then it kind of peaks at noon and then sometimes this isn't always but if he ever goes into low blood sugar it's in the afternoon and it usually is um kind of normal-ish in the afternoon but once in a while it's normal and she does check it pretty frequently his diabetes doctor said he was brittle okay down at dialysis they want him to take the dietician at dialysis and his doctor have recommended that he drink mepro are you familiar with @@@ it's a drink um you know and not an energy drink but a drink to add to your nutrition and it's i guess it's very high in fat and sugar but it's also high in protein which they want for his foot and everything else you know but i haven't always agreed with it so um he takes that a some days and that sends his sugar up because it has tons of sugar in it i just don't get it they said you need more when you're on dialysis now they have you know they knew about the diabetes they knew everything and they said you know what we're going to tell you is actually the opposite of what you've been hearing about the diabetes and i didn't always agree with them so but i understand they reformulating it at the end of this month so maybe it'll @@@ how do i feel oh fine fine no uh no because i take the coumadin yeah i don't know what's that for i don't remember because i don't remember that do you um is it something he was on or did well you know what's the other uh medication you take the amiodarone no @@@ you take @@@ and you take carvedilol and the folic acid does that help some specific heart medicine like coreg yes okay that's the same as carvedilol oh it is oh okay yeah i don't know yeah that and he's the one you know you told me to get an appointment but uh (someone knocked on the door doctor speaks with that person) @@@ @@@ @@@ yes right yes boy that leg is hard (laughs) did you say my heartbeat is a ringer oh regular yeah okay okay that's okay yeah and he has a new pacemaker too he wore one out and so he's had so many surgeries since 2009 that uh cataract pacemaker cancer patient two hip replacements and something else too yes uh well it's been but how long did you smoke oh from probably 16 to 39 maybe is that right yeah okay fine fine @@@ um not that i know of no you mean on the outside or here no here no well um we could um you wouldn't put him on a monday morning though would you okay @@@ oh when he's going to have the labs okay good so that i know so then he can just come in and have all the labs done now sometimes he has those labs done at oak park and they send them to you okay well okay yeah because we have your fax number you know sometimes @@@ coumadin checked okay oh okay okay okay will we get a card or anything to remind him yeah well that's what i mean @@@ yes okay okay okay so this is for us to keep i'll get that go check out okay and now when should we have these labs done did you say oh within the next two weeks okay okay alright i'm just thinking next monday he's going to have some surgery at loyola i don't know how well he'll feel i was thinking

chest tightness or pain and is that mainly when you're coughing and short of breath or uhm at other times as well ok are you having any other any other like can you describe your chest pain a little

anything that makes your symptoms better or worse ok and other than that have you recently at all traveled outside of the country or outside of the province ok now are you having any wheezing at all ok and any kind of headaches or nausea or vomiting ok and any fevers or chills any night sweats ok and how long does your shortness of breath usually last ok and has this happened to you before ok ok and  uh do you have any kind of diarrhea or constipation ok how about fatigue ok and is that just about today or is it do you think it's because of your shortness of breath are you having any of these symptoms when you're trying to sleep ok is it do you ever have to wake up at night to catch a breath or anything like that and have you noticed any kind of uh significant weight loss or anything like that recently ok and have you at all had any changes in your appetite or anything like that ok any exposures to any like dust fumes or any irritants recently ok and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions ok and when were you diagnosed with both of them ok and uh right now do you have any symptoms of any swelling in your extremities like legs hands or anything like that ok and do you have any kind of shortness of breath when you're lying down at all ok and any other medical conditions any allergies any medications you're on right now ok and do you have so is it just the two two puffers ok and are you using like the blue one the blue one more at all are you having to use the short acting one more and does it help at all ok yeah so other than that are you on any other

do you remember ok and have you at all had any kind of heart attacks or anything like that no ok and did they when you were having shortness of breath did you have a like a pneumonia or infection that you had to get antibiotics for any or anything like that ok ok and currently right now do you smoke yeah no that's really good and definitely with these symptoms and your condition that definitely helps to quit smoking whenever you can so congratulations for that any alcohol at all ok and any recreational drugs like marijuana ok how often would you say you smoke marijuana ok and uh do you use a like the provincial marijuana or do you have any other source what would you say you use like uh do you get it from a store that sells the joint ok ok i see yeah i just want to make sure because some if you get it from other sources there might be more irritants in there that can cause some of your symptoms and for them to get worse as well so yeah yeah and other than that do you have any questions or concerns at all yeah so right now what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing shortness of breath and you have a history of copd & chf we definitely want to make sure that you're not having uhm what i think you might be having isn't just an exacerbation of your copd and especially with the green sputum it might be like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse so we'll do all the appropriate testing we'll do a chest x-ray we'll get some blood work done as well w'ell give you some uh ventolin as well while you're here and we might give you like a steroid medication as well so we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now as well as do some of those tests that i mentioned depending on what comes back you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation especially with the chf as well we need to we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your copd exacerbation as well so we need to make sure some of that swelling goes down if we need to adjust your medications while you're here so yeah let's just i'll get back to you we'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there is that ok you're welcome hello are you ready for your surgery today i see have you had surgeries before

so i had put it to be mailed to you at home the cholesterol medication is not urgent i don't want you to waste your time downstairs oh really do you want me to cancel this or okay keep it um let's see what did i put it in for so a 90-day supply with three refills that's the most they let me do 270 days okay uh-huh yeah okay so you know actually looking at your cholesterol level that was taken in january if you're doing everything the same and we get you back on the same medication um i don't think it'll be a problem your last numbers were actually very good yeah simvastatin did its job okay great yeah i mean we still recommend coming in once a year even if you're completely healthy just so we can go over things like you're blood pressure's great your temperature's fine your heart rate is great the weight's a little high yeah so do you uh is there anything in particular you'd like me to talk about this visit okay oh absolutely online not so much clinic would be the best and easiest way and then that way cause you know if we if you e-mail me and then i e-mail you back then there's this gap there's this delay i don't know exactly this is what i want to show you this is the weight this is the trend that we have for the weight so today when you came in we had you at 270 and you know if i look at it it really looks like since about well we'll say go ahead to 2006 the weight's steadily been going up actually there was a three year gap right here so it's almost been pretty steady growth i mean do you have any ideas as to why that is uh-huh yeah so let's talk a little bit about that we'll kind of make that the issue for the day but since i have a bit of time you know they cause my next patient's scheduled at 11:15 so i have a half an hour um let me just try to get a little bit of background history and update your chart make sure that everything is okay um so in here what i'm reading is that you know in the past before we had the medication you had high cholesterol you also had a problem with arthritis in one of the knees which knee was that left right or both okay yeah and you know the thing is the osteoarthritis it gets worse with the weight going up it's just more wear and tear for your legs so if the weight as it is right now 270 pounds that's 70 pounds of weight gain you know since @@@@ in the last six years yeah that is a lot that's a lot of stress on your knees every day that they kind of have to deal with so if your knees are bothering you yeah weather changes will make it worse but weight changes will make it worse for the rest of your life it's just more wear and tear so that's why i want to work on the weight um i'm also reading that you know there's been a history in the past with depression and post-traumatic stress is that right or you tell me okay okay and how do you feel that that's going just uh okay is it helping do you feel things are moving in the right direction okay okay uh-huh uh-huh okay okay uh-huh okay okay uh-huh okay hmm okay you know before i forget to ask i did want to mention um i read that you were on the trazodone to help you go to sleep at night has that been working for you okay okay uh-huh okay uh-huh okay no that's perfectly fine and since it's written as needed then that's okay it's up to you to decide when you want to take it um what i will say is that you know i understand your sentiment about not wanting to take medication the two medications we have you on right now the statin and the aspirin that you take outside as well right those are good medications to be taking um they're gonna do great things to protect your heart protect you from having heart attacks and having strokes the only other problem is you know if the weight goes up i mean actually the weight level we're at right now 270 pounds is too high and it's gonna be the kind of thing where you're only 65 right now but if you'd stay at this weight in another five years maybe even faster than that you're gonna start to develop a lot of health problems which will require medications so if we work on getting this weight under control now we can just keep you on the three medications you're on right now okay so uh uh-huh perfect okay actually yeah that's what i was gonna talk about as well but since they talked to you about that already that yeah so of the two things having you quit tobacco is i think just as important as and you know the thing is actually let me ask you you're smoking ten cigarettes a day still or okay so what i want you to do is try to cut down on that i think that your goal should be at five cigarettes a day and i think you should get there and stay there in the next two months do you think you can do that or what do you think would be more reasonable okay if you can quit i mean don't stop at five if you feel like you can go any further uh-huh hmm okay stress can definitely do it the thing is we have to find better ways of dealing with the stress and actually you know the mental health people are gonna be the ones that can really help you with that i understand that some of the you know activities that they have you do aren't ones that you're necessarily a fan of like writing things down but talk to them and see if there's any other alternatives yeah uh-huh that saw you back in may are you still in contact with him okay okay but you still follow-up with him personally no okay at mental health okay yeah no i agree with you right yeah alright well here's kind of what i want to focus on um i should first let me ask you in terms of your overall mood uh do you feel like you're currently depressed or too anxious okay okay okay so let me just fill these are some of the things that the va wants me to talk to you about one of them is the smoking which we've already kind of done we've come up with a plan and i think it's reasonable and you told me that it's reasonable yeah five cigarettes and the way the easiest way to do it is just you know realize that at the end of this week um smoking one less cigarette a day so all you do to stop smoking five so this week ten next week nine then eight then seven then six then five okay one cigarette a day for the week um so that's we're gonna taper you down and you are willing to quit is that right okay can i see which exactly which one she gave you somewhere in here okay here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna place a consult to the stop smoking clinic and usually what they do is that they'll try to get a hold of you and figure out when would be a good time scheduling wise um the other thing is there is a program here i wonder if this is the same one i can check out the numbers yeah the 1-800 quit now okay so look into this program i mean take a look at this brochure and then call the number and ask them and tell them you're ready okay the other thing that we have to do let's see let me put this in so one of the things that can happen one second so uh you know this is very frustrating for me now we have to do this on the computer while we while we have the encounter in the old days i could write and talk at the same time i can't do the same because there's all this clicking and everything that goes into it so it's just my thing to deal with the other thing that's important to talk about is someone your age with a history of smoking cause one of the things smoking does is it damages the blood vessels and there's actually a very important and very big blood vessel that runs through your entire body basically from here to here it's called your aorta and it's sort of like in the back right by the spinal column and what can happen is over time smoking can damage it and make it sort of swell up and once it's swelled it actually becomes weaker cause the walls kind of stretch and what we worry about is in people that have these large aortas is that they can sort of burst and it's a very very serious medical condition actually roughly 50% of the people that have that happen to them will never even make it into the hospital i mean that's it for them yeah it is the major blood vessel so what we recommend is once you get to around the age of 65 which you know you're at right now we screen you for it and it's a one-time thing basically what we do is we do an ultrasound and take a look see how big it is if it's bigger than normal and normal is about 2 cm or about 1 inch 1 1/2 inches and it can get all the way up to 2 1/2 inches and if it's big then we need to follow it closely and make sure it's not getting bigger too quickly and if it reaches a certain size then we can do a surgery before you know it ruptures and the outcome is way better if that's the case so what i would like to do with your permission is just schedule you for an ultrasound okay so we'll go ahead and well you gotta wait your turn i might need one of those too so let's see we have the ultrasound and that's fine okay great finish let's go ahead and put that in for that uh is that in the morning the eye clinic okay so i'll put the order in for 5 a.m but they really should be able to do it anytime so just go down to radiology and on that day just ask them let them know that and i need an ultrasound where do i go for that and they'll point you in the right direction i can tell you know i mean you know september 6th uh-huh so i mean that's uh that's it for me you know what i'll also do; i'll repeat the lipid panel on september 6th that sound okay oh to check for the cholesterol and everything actually no once a year is fine you did have it in january so we don't need to do it any time faster than that it was actually right at the beginning of the year so we can do it after the winter holidays okay so that uh-huh so i mean it's not a problem right now everything's good uh just a few quick questions from me are you having any fevers or chills any nausea or vomiting any trouble breathing any shortness of breath or cough okay yeah has that cough been the same for the last couple years couple decades okay uh-huh any crushing chest pain or pressure chest pressure where you feel like you can't breathe okay okay what kind of pain is that okay yeah uh-huh how often does that happen that numb feeling uh would you say once a week once a month once a day uh-huh and are you doing anything that makes that happen for example uh how far can you walk before you get tired or out of breath okay and does that cause the arm pain okay can you climb uh how many flights of stairs can you climb okay any pain in the arm when that happens okay exactly so this i think is musculoskeletal and i think it's just you know from using the arm let me go ahead and take a listen uh do me a favor nice deep breaths with your mouth open so just go in and out in and out in and out in and out in and out in and out one more great alright the lungs sound clear go ahead and take a listen you can breathe normally again actually let's have you lie down it might help you feel a little bit better let's take a look at the stomach any pain when i push when i push when i push no how about here how long has that been going on for years any problems with bowel movements any blood in the stools dark stool diarrhea or constipation no that's fine sit up how often do you have a bowel movement twice a day any fevers or chills alright you can have a seat back on the chair okay alright so that's the plan alright ultrasound when you come back in uh also we'll get wow there's no other labs actually we've decided no labs for now so we'll repeat the lipid panel in one year alright and that's it following mental health and then the smoking so i'll be back in just probably about a minute but if it's not a minute don't get upset alright it wasn't more than a minute was it been watching it oh my goodness @@@ alright @@@ no eye you're not italian puerto rican how are you yeah so it seems you are doing well yeah so far yeah except the tobacco that i smell smell yeah right yeah yeah i know you're working on it so yeah okay good good good alright so everything is good except that you just need to get some blood tests and to check your vitamin d you know at some point it was low i want to make sure that it’s okay yeah yeah oh perfect so let's do that uh-huh yeah yeah cause that right so let's do that and then we are also checking hiv on all the patients regardless okay the risk factors um when was the last time you were checked we don't do hiv when we draw the blood yeah we usually need your permission to screen for it specifically so it's not in the included blood tests if you want we can go ahead and screen you and sort of why you'll take that permission so that's what i'll do that yeah and then um then just one more thing you need a booster shot for whooping cough um it's coming back up again so we are giving booster shots for all the vets yes today and its okay exactly this is a shot as well is that okay with you yeah yes alright we'll let the nurse know that okay yeah yeah maintenance total maintenance yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah alright that sounds good we'll let you know if anything comes back abnormal okay @@@ out a little bit link between the two no no no the pneumonia you get more often but this is just a booster just because by the time you get yeah let me just make okay yeah pneumococcal vaccine yep there will not be and it looks like it was low then so we can't really do anything based off that value in 2009 cause it's @@@@ now so let's see how it is in the meantime maybe it's improved maybe it hasn't um but since i'm doing that and we're doing the hiv screening we're sticking you anyway uh i'm gonna go ahead and bump those some of the other tests that we talked about up just normal routine stuff that we went over the cholesterol did you eat this morning no you haven't eaten anything since yesterday for dinner no coffee no juice nothing oh mind if i add that on so we'll get the full panel you know okay so let's see where is my @@@ you know what i'll actually i won't look for it right now i'll talk to the nurse and let her know you hear that too right so we'll do that and we'll get you out of here alright so there we go we talked about this this this and this alright and you did agree to get screened so i put the order in already yep just like we talked about alright so here we go and this is it alright and lets sign all this fun stuff and get you going oh this is signed go ahead and find the nurse and let her know and then six months should be fine sooner if there are any problems and you know what's gonna keep you out is working on smoking and the weight i mean if you can get those two under control by yourself then you might just have to deal with me once a year alright so take this to the clerk actually uh just @@@ let her know you need your shot sorry you have to meet with them but don't leave quite yet </doctor> <patient> sure i've been feeling very short of breath for the past uh two weeks but even before that i started feeling a little bit short of breath and i can't stop coughing and it just feels like it's really hard for me to breathe yeah it started two weeks ago yeah the same amount of time it started about maybe three weeks ago i started coughing more um but now it's worse it's definitely wet my phlegm looks green it's been like that for the past two weeks yeah before that i was still coughing but not as much no not that i know of no no fevers uhm no not that no blood uhm i'm bringing up about i'd say it would fill like two two of my palms like the inside of my palm it's pretty constant now no fevers uhm its uh ok its more with exertion but right now even at rest i'm coughing and feeling short of breath uh yeah some chest tightness uhm other times as well uhm i would say it's a uh it's a tightness in my chest and it feels i guess throbbing or achy uh it just stays in my chest uh no no no uhm i guess activity makes it worse un and like cold air things like that uh no no not recently uhm some wheezing yeah no nothing like that ah nope nothing like that ah sometimes i feel sweaty but that's just with the shortness of breath it lasts about uh i don't know i kind of feel short of breath all the time but when it's really bad it lasts about five-ten minutes and then it goes back to like my normal shortness of breath uhm no i don't think so like not not this bad i've always had some shortness of breath but nothing like this uhm no nothing like that yeah i feel fatigued yeah it's probably cause of my shortness of breath uh yeah i think its yeah when i'm laying down sometimes i feel more short of breath than usual but once i shift positions it goes back to it's normal ah no it doesn't wake me up no no no change in appetite no uhm just copd uhm and i also have some congestive heart failure copd i've been i got diagnosed about seven years ago chf about two years ago some swelling in some swelling in my legs yeah uh a little bit yeah a little bit i would say nope no others no yeah i'm on uh an ace inhibitor i'm on uh spironolactone uhm i'm on i have some puffers for my copd i believe what do i have i have um i have a long acting beta agonist and i guess i have a short acting as well for when i need it mhm i'm definitely using the short acting more like i'm using it almost every day uh i4 think so no yeah i've been taking all my medications i was hospitalised two years ago for shortness of breath and some low oxygen that's when they diagnosed me with chf uhm i guess just yeah i'm not really too sure they said i had some heart condition and my heart isn't functioning as well as it should be they did an echo on me no uhm no actually i might have gotten some antibiotics at one point but not during that visit no i stopped smoking two years ago i drink some alcohol i drink maybe once a week i smoke once in a while i smoke about a joint a week i use uhm pardon me what was that do i use yeah i get it from like a medical dispensary oh i see i see ok no what do you think i should do from for now yeah that sounds great thank you i'm ready as can be this isn't my first rodeo yeah i have i think it's in my report that you have with you it's been really wild bet you're my new doctor after you i can't pronounce that okay hmm been a long day i'm just here to yeah well it's uh this is i'm supposed to see you you're supposed to be my new uh my new uh general practitioner uh the other question is uh i don't understand why there wasn't a uh a uh thing in for blood work yeah and i spoke with the lady when i spoke to her a few weeks ago she told me that uh i was given a new primary care doctor so i asked her first well okay set up the date and i asked her do i have to you know i'll come in and have the blood work done she says well nobody's put in anything for a blood work or anything i says well you know i don't know how long you've been doing this job but generally when they change from one doctor to another doctor they do a blood work; this way here the incoming doctor knows what's going on because i think my last blood work was in january okay no the primarily uh the cholesterol count that was the uh big thing because i'm out of my cholesterol medication and if i can get the if i can get the the medication that's fine and then in the next three months when i come in to see you or whatever yeah right now usually what i do usually i order mine online yeah no no no no no no let it go this way i don't know how many other refills are behind this okay that's fine because uh it's a half a tablet that i take in the evening so it's actually that works out fine that's fine that's that was the biggest concern i don't have any aches or pains or anything nothing to speak of other than old age uh i'll be back here the 6th of september yeah the medication that they put me on the simvastatin or whatever it is yeah it's doing its job it's not like i go out and have steaks and everything every day or anything but uh no everything as long as i don't have to if i don't have to be here i don't want to be here yeah that i that i got to work on uh no sir but if i have any questions in the near future i can probably reach you online having to wait no other than the fact that i smoke i've been out of work for the last two years so i'm inactive and uh it's probably really what it is okay uh yeah both it's more like when uh the weather changes you know it's an age thing i don't think it's uh you know i don't think i hurt my legs or anything that's a lot okay yes as a matter of fact i'm going through uh 228 uh well i just started just like uh my third week uh well the first time i went into this thing it was a group thing uh i don't like writing things down okay i just don't like it i don't like the fact that they turn around and somebody says write it down so the more you i don't have to write it down to remember it the incident that happened in vietnam i don't like to write it down it's there and it wakes me up in the middle of the night uh i get uh i feel like i have restless leg syndrome uh doesn't matter what time of the year it is but i'll i'll go for a walk i'll go for a walk and i'm gone i'm gone for hour hour and a half uh in the session that i'm in right now it's like on a one to one basis and uh i feel like they're trying to pull me into saying something uh last week they asked me says when you're calm you know 0-100 they have this scale when you're calm you know how do you feel where are you the most calm at i'm most calm at home front porch you know where there's no stress or anything where i feel the most is in crowds i don't go to ballgames uh i try to avoid large crowds period if i walk into a building i don't care if i've been in this building 100 times when i walk through that first door first thing i look for is an exit i want to be able to get out if something happens if i feel that my anxiety gets too high i want to be able to get out i don't want to be i don't want to be suppressed i don't want to you know be held someplace where i don't want to be if i go to a picnic uh it's fine i'm outside because i have the freedom that if something doesn't feel right to me i can leave uh i distance myself from a lot of people that i used to know there are a lot of things that i used to do that i enjoyed doing i don't do anymore uh i'm fine as long as my mind and hands are occupied i do little crafts around the house sometimes i have the guy downstairs and he hands out those crafts and stuff i'll pick up one of those things and it gives me something to do when i'm at the house uh uh-huh uh only as needed only as needed that's the whole thing i already take as needed i don't like taking medications doc uh i take my cholesterol medication because i know that i need it and i have to keep that in control but i do not want to become dependent on a sleep medication so yes i have used it i don't fill it as often as i should but if i feel that you know i feel that i need it i take it i don't take it every day yeah yeah yeah yeah that'll work there's uh the young lady uh the prep nurse she gave me uh; she gave me my pneumonia vaccination uh she gave me this move that and uh the way to quit tobacco i got all the literature she did a good job of presenting her case and everything yeah okay okay that's an attainable goal yeah i can do that i can do that well you know it's kind of funny uh when my son was born and my son's in his 30s right now when my son was born i quit smoking and then uh when he was about 12 or 13 he was in an accident and i snapped because you should the accident shouldn't have happened so on the way driving from chicago to wisconsin i picked up a pack of cigarettes and i just started smoking again i think it was more a lack of worry and i think that's what did most of it yeah well i'm on the one to one basis right now and uh right now they're recording my sessions and i sit there and we talk but it's not talk as in like we're doing now okay she's going down this book you know talks about this talks about this talk about this uh where is your stress level what is the medium stress i don't know what a medium stress level is i couldn't i know what my high stress level is and i know how calm i am i have no clue what a middle is i have no clue what a middle is i tend to leave areas when i feel uncomfortable uh-huh yeah he's the one that got me into this one on one program no no i right now when i talk to somebody else over there it's a name yeah she's the one that prescribed the trazodone and we'll sit down and we'll talk you know it's easier to talk when you're not reading it out of a book you know what i'm saying you know it's like it's like somebody's looking at you and they're reading a instruction manual on how to deal with you it's fine but kind of gives you that uneasy feeling there for a while you know they have a good system and everything i just feel that it's too book too much book but you know that's just my opinion i'm not depressed uh i'm always anxious even i'm always anxious uh somebody turns around and tells me well we're gonna leave at 3:30 quarter to 3 i'm ready to go i'll sit and wait for the 45 minutes okay 3:30 you ain't ready i'm gone don't tell me we're gonna do something at a certain time and then i understand things happen but you have so much time to get from point a to point b and you want to be there at a certain time let's get on the let's go uh-huh okay yeah it's attainable okay in other words if i eliminate one cigarette this week okay alright sure the last time i was in here i talked to the doctor and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you right uh all three of them and the pneumonia shot the other one is yeah you know i'm gonna have to say and anyway he turned around and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you quit i said okay fine he says how about if we put you in for the what do you call it the patch i was okay fine you know never heard anything else about it uh-huh oh it's the yes uh the lady told me that there was uh i can go to this thing here and take a little survey thing online okay okay we got a plan hmm it's a major blood vessel okay okay sure schedule me for a brain transplant if you need alright doc but i'll be here; i'll be back in the hospital here september 6th i'll be here september 6th at the eye clinic downstairs september 6th yeah okay well radiology is on the first floor right by the lab lipid panel okay hmm we can do it in uh that'll work i mean the only other time i'll have to draw blood is if i come in here for something else yeah uh no no uh no i have a cough but i think it's related to smoking it's been the same for the last uh cute no uh actually it's only; it's gotten worse in the last three months the last three months it's really gotten worse but you know like i say i think i attribute most of it now being as though we're having this conversation about smoking regarding to that so uh no but uh on occasion it'll start hurting behind here in my left arm uh like a dull numbing pain not sharp or anything it's just more; it's more like you know when your hand falls asleep and you try to get it back up to get that it's just that numb feeling and it just it's just annoying sometimes then other times my hands will uh it was uh if i had to put an average on it i'd say every two weeks not unless i'm sleeping wrong but i doubt that uh oh i can walk for an hour no no i climb a flight of stairs every day no uh i ride my motorcycle and i don't even know if the sun's shining or not uh here lately i've become uh a since july no uh those are heart attack symptoms yeah okay uh uh uh uh uh uh now that's a little tender for years no no no no twice a day i have one in the morning and then i have one uh later on that day no usually on occasion i try if i have a fever or a chill it's uh usually it's from uh being caught in the rain or whatever the thing is if i feel sick i don't go by my great grandson i don't need them to get sick when grandpa's not feeling well yeah yeah yeah okay okay alright thank you yeah i get antsy i've been watching the clock i’m kidding fine no no no no eye no i'm puerto rican not italian i'm good okay yeah doing well so far i didn't tell her she smelled it she smelled it i know that i mean i'm not trying to hide it you know yes i do i do smoke but i could like some other people do and spray the binaca and stuff yeah uh we uh we set a goal for right now well they can take the blood on the way out i can get it done on the way out that's what i was telling you earlier uh you know this way i get it i don't have that i know that i don't have that yeah every time they the blood the last time they drew blood i'm going right down to have blood taken and you might as well have everything done right now i got the pneumonia today i got the pneumonia today you mean to take them both at the same time yeah yeah well let me know check the tires rotate the @@@ @@@ do what you gotta do you know right you know it's like i know we were talking about this earlier i couldn't understand why they didn't want to you know didn't put an order in for drawing blood when i came earlier before the uh visit that's fine i told him i said that's fine i can do it on the way out and this way here you guys can analyze it boil it feed it to vampires whatever you need to do okay thank you very much okay yeah well that's okay oh how do i get that yeah i already got the pneumonia it's not it's no uh there's no interaction of these two uh shots @@@ so the most @@@ this is something now there's not gonna be any drug interaction between this and the other okay alright i just want to make sure i'm not uh driving down the street and i start hallucinating uh-huh hmm okay yeah the the cholesterol and everything no that's right alright yeah so when i stopped in at the lab this morning the girl asked and says did you eat anything i said yeah i had steak and eggs uh she says no i got i says no i haven't had anything since yesterday so that's why i stopped at the lab thing to have the blood drawn but there was no order in and the cholesterol medication will be sent in the mail to me that'll work yeah that's what usually happens you know unless i don't have to be here i come in here for other things okay i can deal with that

usually nighttime cough that's what it is yeah um you're just taking the albuterol now right formoterol are you using that too formoterol with mometasone no steroids yeah that's one uh i don't know the name of it it's the two things in one but it's a steroid you been using that how long has the cough been going on okay and i think maybe we should just let it ride out for a little bit with the season i don’t think changing the medicines is gonna do much i'm pretty sure it's probably the asthma so i think you just have to give it a little bit of time if it gets worse we can maybe try changing the medicines i think with only three days we don't really want to do anything aggressive and then have you on too much medicine does that sound okay your lungs sound good you're not wheezing or anything like that so um and you haven't had a prostate exam yet or anything like that have you uh uh yeah the colon the prostate is a different uh we can do a blood test to look for that um and then do what you had a blood test okay we might need to go up on one of these blood pressure pills cause it looks like the last time you were here it was a little high so maybe we'll go up on your amlodipine um so we'll go ask him okay i'll be right back everything else looks great alright everything he said looks good we'll just do blood tests today we'll go up on the amlodipine and um yeah i can sure um um let me let me make sure @@@ here you've been there before yes okay yeah i can put everything in so we'll just um on your way out i guess just stop i don't know um just ask her at the front about getting the shot i don't know how to order it um if they know how they can let me know so we can get one yeah the tetanus shot um they should be able to order it up there i think or the nurse can and then um get the blood tests and then i'll have them send you the new prescription in the mail if you want alright yeah they're right where they oh the blood tests yeah it's across the hall um at the lab alright yeah alright have a good one </doctor> <patient> i've got about three weeks left sir twenty five days if you want to be exact absolutely i don't want to go back no sir

alright omeprazole simvastatin okay do you still take an aspirin every day yeah any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet okay @@@ well here's your blood tests we can go through it prostate test was normal yep we'll do a which helps to identify problems with the prostate um kidney function is normal your glucose was right at the borderline for what we could consider diabetes and we already know that was the case for your so fine liver function is good this was back in a little bit even further back like in october where we had some urine tested for showed some reflection of diabetes and then the cholesterol which was a little bit high back then so the things that we want to do now now do you get your blood checked with that outside doctor okay yeah well i want to avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen but there's information that we need to share that that doctor and myself or or we'll have to have you repeat some of the blood tests here so if you have any blood work there bring it into me uh if you're willing though i'll get some blood tests here okay yeah that was good yeah now they didn't do um a cholesterol they did the prostate the kidney and liver and um electrolytes but no cholesterol and @@@ since you started on that medication @@@ it was 208 here but for you we want it significantly lower than that particularly the ldl which is the bad cholesterol come on up here i'll take a listen to you what for oh yeah can i make a copy of this okay thanks okay yes you do a lot of people do a lot of people have them and they never have symptoms they never cause problems and so we don't mess with them that's the problem you go looking for stuff and find stuff would you be able to roll this up for me @@@ @@@ the agent orange thing yeah often when you have an infection in your lungs you know you'll have a pneumonia at sometime in your life or you might get some scar tissue in there and it builds up it looks funny on the x-ray so we tell people i don't know that that is so we'll going to check usually it's nothing hold on a second so you're telling me you have some urine symptoms is it burning no blood in your urine okay we'll do a urine test today deep breath @@@ that’s good that’s a little bit low actually yeah uh-huh alright well your blood tests were very good i think @@@ i'll have you come in the same thing like you did this time maybe a week before you come in and we'll plan on doing that four months from now uh-huh yeah i think you can stay on it we'll just do one blood test today and then i'll call you if there are any changes do you want to do it on your way out okay well that could be probably because the blood sugar was too high or too low with the sugar i'm not quite sure though this test that we're going to do today will help us get a sense about that have you seen an eye doctor in the last year well there you go yeah it looks likes everything was okay too alright i'll be right back alright sir i'm going to get those blood tests today and then um four months is when you're going to come see me i want you to get a fasting blood test about a week before oh yeah @@@ yeah this city's full of them so full of ryans check out in front first they'll help you set that up and then you go down to the lab and get the blood happy new year yeah take care </doctor> <patient> hi so i just like for i don't know like

i don't think i know that's not like a a real like way to say i have i have allergies usually in like the spring in the fall no no nothing like that it's just like i get really bad allergies like i i've seen an allergist and some years i've gotten allergy shots but like not every year otherwise i'll take like claritin this isn't like this is maybe around like this is just before they normally start so i don't really have them right now probably like in a few weeks they'd be really bad uh like it feels like a little bit like plugged up an like what's that called like post nasal drip but i don't really feel like i can't breathe yeah yeah exactly those are the ones that i'd have like once usually like once a week for a little while like in the winter before no no they said it's not like one of those allergies and it's just like it's just like the seasonal ones but they're just bad my family doctor i don’t really go very often no like i've been really healthy it's just like the allergies and uh no no i take claritin for allergies but i haven't like right now i just have it with me just in case i take birth control deyo yeah it's just like the pill it's like the one that goes

uh no i usually don't do i usually don't check it myself i was in for the blood test last week i don't know if the results came back uh i did about a month ago i had it for like i think i must have picked up some kind of a ate something bad or something cause it was like a 24 hour thing but normally i've been doing pretty good and feeling pretty good appetite's good uh it's pretty steady stays pretty much at the yeah for a long time yeah i should probably lose 20 at least uh yeah i brought some of the stuff uh; well we're taking the metformin they tell me to take two usually i just take one usually i've been averaging probably one a day yeah yeah a doctor gave me something he said my cholesterol was a little high so he gave me something for the for the cholesterol i guess uh probably every other day you know the low dose one i just take it like uh no no they're pretty good i always make toast in the morning and it always comes you know it always comes out hot i feel it when i pull it out okay really terrific wow uh when i go to the office i think the last time i was probably there about a month and a half ago or so they did a blood test and it was like i think he said it was like 130 or something like that like my blood count yeah yeah okay okay sure well how did the blood test last week show up for the fasting it did oh okay but they did the uh hmm yeah he said it wasn't i think he said it was around 202 or maybe it was 220 maybe it was 220 oh okay okay okay i got the results of the cat scan; i had the cat scan done cause when i was here uh doing an evaluation for the agent orange they wanted me to take a chest x-ray and something showed up on the chest x-ray so uh this is like the third cat scan i've had and they've been pretty much unchanged i guess since the first one you can keep that yeah i had them make a copy so i could bring one here the other thing the doctor said that i had gallstones so it's you know and they says you know you got gallstones i'm

use so no other recreational drugs right yeah so we can definitely talk more about alcohol usage definitely especially when there's uh people going through stressful times there can be increasing substance use including alcohol so we definitely have a lot of resources that we can um discuss today if you would like you're welcome um yeah but those are all the questions i had for today we'll definitely do like a physical examination but it seems you've just been having a cough for the last two weeks without any other symptoms um okay so do you have any questions at all for me so what we'll do is since you've had this cough for the last two weeks we definitely want to do a covid swab just in case you've been uh working from home but if there was any potential contact they usually it comes back in 24 to 48 hours other than that sometimes uh with a history of smoking you can have something called uh copd we can like after the physical examinations and everything we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function tests as well um and yeah but other than that it can also just be like a dry cough can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes two or more weeks to resolve in that case we wouldn't really um yeah so we'll do the physical examination and then go from there alright take care you have type two diabetes and high cholesterol your diabetes is poorly controlled date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ you're the last one yeah no just a lot of patients today how are you feeling okay oh because of the lung thing they talked to your daughter right i think that's what they did what'd your daughter think cause i got a message that you wanted me to call your daughter oh yeah okay is she home right now i could call her right now with it oh okay so she wants to talk to me just so that we just clarify about everything that's going on alright what do you understand about everything that's going on the 29th of uh an mri yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it is well it's because they saw this thing in your in your lungs yeah so when we got this other one in july you know to follow up it said you had a 2 x 1 cm sized mass in the right upper lobe of your lung so the top part of your right lung this was new since previous exams uh and then that's when they recommended that maybe you needed a pet scan which is another ct scan um i don't think they noticed this before that time is that right but they're saying that it wasn't there before here at the va okay uh they're saying it's new because it's moved and i read their note cause this is beyond me you know july 19th is when they first talked about it yeah a pet scan yeah that's what happened so you had it before but now it's bigger that's what it is so even though it was slow it's gotten bigger and that's what concerned them i'm reading it right now and they wanted to talk about it but imaging was reviewed you used to smoke a ct scan of july just to look at it and they saw the 2 x 1 cm mass then they compared it to a ct imagining back in 2005 and looking back at it it was present but now it's bigger and that's what worries him that it grew why did it grow if it was stable it wouldn't have grown that much that's why but that's what they're worried that if it's a malignant cancer that's the only reason something like that would grow true no you're right you would be weak and would have probably more of a cough you'd probably feel you know like you're not gaining weight let me look at your weight you've lost weight or you've gained weight yeah uh-huh @@@ yeah hmm okay i could talk to your daughter and i'll try to call her like in the afternoons it's kind of hard for me to call in the afternoon but but so they're saying that this could be consistent with cancer and that's why they wanted to get the pet scan to see if it's spreading and the pet scan that – showed them that you have some findings also in the middle of your chest not just on the right and something right over your kidneys that doesn't mean that you have the cancer but there's sure something there so at this point they feel that the only way they can confirm if it's cancer or not is to get a sample of it and he told you that he recommended the biopsy and you agreed right yeah i know yeah so i think it's worth investigating you know obviously you already said yes @@@ i just apologize if it felt like they were telling you you're on your last leg i really don't want you to feel like that i think they just wanted to let your family know and then just so they could be ready it could be nothing it could be something you know just so they know because the next thing you know if something does happen why were they doing this why did this happen you know i think that's all it is i think he just wants your daughter to know everything that's going on yeah he did but she also wanted to talk to me about it okay so i'll try to call her today or tomorrow okay okay well then what we'll do is - and this biopsy is scheduled for when do you know the 11th of september and you're on coumadin right maybe we'll start a lovenox injections that way you wouldn't have to get admitted to the hospital because you know when you're on warfarin you have to stop it we still have to give you medications so you won't clot so the urologist did the oh you didn't switch is this for afib and he didn't give you injections or anything let me see let me look in my old notes it's only because of your heart you're heart your irregular rhythm that's why you're on coumadin that was because of clots back in the day right oh yeah okay so he @@@ to come off yeah so how you doing with the yeah you're doing okay and your voiding trial was okay right yeah alright your blood pressure alright stay right there don't move and you've been taking all your medications today move your legs alright and you took it this morning right yeah and did you um you didn't change your medications

might take it before the no for the no for the um @@@ for the @@@ they just took me off i didn't take nothing they haven't put me on nothing you just took me off for the six days no they don't give me nothing right yeah that's what happened oh no no no that was for the since they found out i had an irregular heartbeat uh-huh yeah that's what he said except for days within that date they might have to give me the shots or something like that i said well @@@ before you don't give me nothing and i was off for six days so they had put me to sleep for this and that they gave me anesthesia and all that stuff prostate sure not a thing uh-huh it high now that ain't got nothing with the blood pressure yeah and then we know what it takes you know i only take the lisinopril once a day 30 yeah i woke up this morning and that's what i take this morning yeah before i took my medicine and it was 180 something over 1 something yeah the lisinopril @@@ from the @@@ now it's 200 huh oh then it's gone down some it was 181 or 182 when she was taking it was 180 something before i took it before i took my medicine i took it in the morning around 9 o'clock it goes like that so then it goes all the way till it gets numb @@@ keep looking anyway i took it again it'd be down to like 130 and then 130 120 and sometime i take it it'll be 160 take my meds and it'll go down to 140 130 it's gone down some already cause it was 187 when she took it yeah @@@ changing medicine then after a while you've check it later on so it went down uh-huh yeah so what should i do i check it at home every so often i get tired @@@ oh i didn't check for a while i been here like i said sometimes i get up before i take the medicine it's 160 or 170 or something like that i take my medicine and about three hours later check it and it's down to 140 130 134 stuff like that and if i stay around long enough it goes down to 128 and stuff like that so actually it's kind of a weird i said the hell with it like i said the only time i feel bad is when it goes below 120 when it go down like in the 105 and stuff like that then i get a little off balance but other than that i feel fine uh-huh before the surgery they did that what they do uh some time ago yeah yeah they took me off of that stuff it was going too low at night; it was going down to the 80s yeah going down to 80s yeah take me off the meds man it'd get me kind of woozy at night off balance during daytime or like nighttime i they at 30 yeah what is that 10 20 then they got 30 and they changed my urine type medicine the prostate cause we just had too much yeah you stopped that and you changed my prostate medicine here for the urine tract you got that stopped you changed that too that's when i had to go back to gu cause it started interfering with my tract so i went back to gu they put me on something okay no problem @@@ but i can’t say anything i probably do yeah with that is the lisinopril every day i take it every morning time every morning at 9 o'clock uh-huh i'm not sure uh-huh in half uh-huh uh-huh but if it goes down too low at nighttime what do i then i know but like just what i said when i take it it goes down low in between time at nighttime it goes down low anyway yeah that i don't that's what i say uh sometimes it goes down in the low 90s and sometimes i take it and it run around 89 yeah i know it normally be 160 something or 170 oh about 10 11 yeah 10 pm yeah i normally sometime i don't go to bed till 12 o'clock i take uh; i take my coumadin at 9 o'clock and i take my prostate medicine about at 11 right before i go to bed no if it goes low sometimes @@@ yeah no i drink coffee in the morning that's all that's what bothers me sometimes it go down low at night so it goes down too low to me and i get uh lightheaded off balance like you know yeah that's what i know i'm too high in the morning uh-huh they saw it they needed to check it and see yeah it wasn't @@@ yeah that's what i say @@@ you know it gets too low in the evening time and i told the one nurse she said as long as it don't go below the 90s too much you know try to keep it around 100 at least and no i'm supposed @@@ i have to take it twice a day about 9 o'clock i take the one i don't eat i don't eat uh uh i don't eat breakfast and i'm kind of hungry about 2 o'clock and i eat late i only eat one meal a day mostly yeah @@@ i don't eat that often that's why; if i eat i gain too much weight if i eat breakfast then i got to eat something at noontime or something like that and then i'll be hungry before that so if i can do without breakfast in the morning then i can go all day without eating no never eat at the end of at night you call @@@ yeah @@@ yeah no but if i eat breakfast then i have to eat something in the midday i get likes hungry

<doctor> are you taking benicar and what else okay that's good information date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ he was one of the other residents and i understand you had the colonoscopy and uh everything looked okay you had a polyp that wasn’t cancerous well it's uh yes @@@ but uh the next thing that you just need to have another one in ten years or so if you have more polyps than usually they want to repeat the colonoscopies a little more frequently so and then you had any more chest pains just numbness okay okay and you didn't see anybody before that for a long time okay alright and let me see what the uh did you have a rectal exam the last time do you know because one of the things that uh we need to do to evaluate your prostate and you can do it a couple of ways by either measuring uh the level of your prostate-specific antigen it's something they find in your blood and then also a digital exam where we examine your rectum yeah is that something you want to consider it now no yeah uh at your next visit then we'll talk about it again and now you can think about it okay it's something i don't think we have to do today but we could do it next time too if you feel more comfortable with that and uh other than that you know all your labs everything looked okay too but this was actually from before okay and then do you check your blood pressure at home uh do you check it whenever you go anywhere else okay cause today actually you know it was 133/80 and then on repeat it was 149/98 you know sometimes its a little bit higher when you come to the doctor's office so for right now we can actually just continue with you know just continue with are you taking the amlodipine okay yeah i can refill those for you oh and do you want to get them in the mail or do you want to get them here uh @@@ okay oh good so you actually have enough for @@@ and those are the only two medicines that you take well let me ask you a few questions and then when you come back here uh let's see march april may june july august so in about six months we'll check your cholesterol then too okay but the last time it looked okay any other things i can help you with today okay you didn't have any changes in your vision other than i saw that you had a visual studies test done showing that you @@@ out of the corner of your eye but you didn't notice that okay okay good and you’re driving okay is there a reason is it because of that no okay oh are you still drinking how much okay but were driving under the oh oh okay and do you feel like you've got a problem with it no @@@ no and any are you smoking okay so any drugs no so and well if you don't feel that the alcohol is a problem right now okay good oh right uh any problems when you urinate any pain no blood in your stool let me have you sit up here and see you a minute oh well @@@ deep breath and will you lie down would you lift up your shirt any pain anywhere any swelling in your legs okay i want to just look at your immunizations do you know if you're up-to-date on those oh good uh how about your tetanus you don't know when you did it has it been about 10 years do you want to get that today okay alright um take a seat okay alright everything looks good i think that uh one thing that we could do about your blood pressure right now is have you cut down on the amount of salt do you eat a lot of salt do you eat a lot of okay so a lot of processed foods in fact about 80% of what we take in in terms of salts comes in from processed foods so it's not really what you add during your meals but if you could just try cutting back on do you eat a lot of you know frozen foods so try cutting back on those things and that'll actually help and that'll bring your blood pressure down a little bit too and then we'll see where it is next time i see you okay and today i'll send up the nurse to give you a tetanus shot i don't know if she's still around so just give me a second while i find her okay and if not then you can just have that done the next time you come in alright alright so i don't see her so why don't we just plan on doing that next time okay and you'll need to take this with you and they'll set up an appointment for you about six months yeah does that sound like well it'll be in the @@@ okay alright and then make sure that when you come back you get your labs drawn before you'll just stop at the it's kind of diagonal to here to get your blood drawn yeah and then uh and we'll think about the rectal exam alright okay alright </doctor> <patient> yes twenty daily i take some

"<doctor> i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in ok so what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago ok and uh when you're exercising or in gym class do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing ok and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away ok and uh does this happen in any other settings ok so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds like you've had noisy breathing before ok ok and have you had a cough ok and were there anything was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away ok how many days per week are you using that ok well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today sometimes for steroid medications those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time ok and have you had any other associated symptoms um so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing ok and do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin ok and how about any nausea or vomiting ok any infectious symptoms overall ok any urinary problems ok bowel problems ok um and uh any fevers or chills ok and then how about uh have you been having any night sweats so uh overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating ok ok so i just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health have you been so you mentioned asthma have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions ok um and any recent hospitalizations ok and any surgeries ok and any medications besides it like that including the inhalers ok and any allergies ok and do you have any like seasonal allergies do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy ok and uh are immunizations up to date ok and so i actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits but first i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation ok ok and um where do you go to school ok and in what grade now ok and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in yeah so it's something that we will look into today i'm i'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together and that reminded me of a question i wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before so essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device yeah exactly ok right thank you for clarifying and so so for the last few questions about and your personal habits i was wondering i understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol do any of your friends do that ok and can you tell me a little bit about your diet just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet ok and are you currently sexually active ok and do you use a condom every time or sometimes ok great and um have you had any other partners ok but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before ok and i know this question might seem a little bit invasive but it's important to ask everybody have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself ok ok great um and in your family has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before ok and any allergies that run in the family ok um so overall it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising out in the cold and then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago so i think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently and so will look into that and then also the question about the marines uh interest with asthma excellent any changes to your diet how're you feeling since starting this diet date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ i don't know heck yeah okay its are you having bowel movements that works better for you so we'll switch you back to that okay oh they sent that automatically and they charged you for it okay if it's unopened they might okay okay uh yeah @@@ what do you need the gloves for what do you need the gloves for okay okay absolutely i'd grab a few what have your sugars been running in the morning okay not too bad okay yeah me too uh-huh oh i wouldn't i didn't i @@@ beat the celtics yeah i didn't watch it oh if they win tonight they're in how many days are left so if they lose they're out if they win they're in okay i was thinking a liquid might work better but i'll switch you back to those pills you're taking an aspirin every day right okay and you're taking the medicine for your cholesterol alright very good okay and you're not having any worsening chest pain or anything like that are you uh-huh you want me to put some in okay yeah i put um 90 day supply with three refills and you can take one or two tablets it comes the prescription will say take two tablets as needed and they'll come with you know 180 but you can take one or two as needed correct you're due to see the eye doctor too in may yeah yeah that's the next one uh-huh just any time in may any time that works for you you can set it up today i think i'm not exactly sure you saw him in february and you actually saw who did you see you saw a nurse at the foot clinic you saw the foot doctor in november yeah they wanted you to come back as well so we can schedule that too uh-huh now in @@@@ you had a colonoscopy um let's see you haven't noticed any blood in your stool or black tarry stool or weight loss or anything like that cause what i'm trying to figure out if you've had your colonoscopy in @@@@ uh about six years ago showed a couple polyps and they were removed and they were the least dangerous kind of polyps but at that time your the doctors thought you might the colonoscopy doctor thought you might need to get a repeat colonoscopy yet last year or this year you know depending on how your overall health is i think your overall health is pretty good um you've got some heart disease but um you know you're lungs are okay i think you should would be able to tolerate a colonoscopy um if that's something you wished to pursue no okay yeah okay i think that's reasonable i mean you're 84 you're pretty healthy the benefits would be catching a cancer early um if you notice any unexplained weight loss fevers chill you know sweats weight loss anything like that or if you notice your stool changing huh like unexplained sweats or weight loss okay uh so your weight's been pretty stable so or if you notice tarry stool and it would be black like the color of this um let me take a listen to you deep breath and i'll listen to your heart would you be willing to get some blood work done today checking your a1c your diabetes would you be willing to check some blood today alright you're all set um give this to them up front and we're just gonna check that diabetes lab we'll get you to the eye doctors and foot doctors yeah i'd get it checked today while you're here yeah i put that in see its right here well they'll probably make you wait cause they @@@ that's our motto at the va they got your order in there so it should be ready for you yeah and they'll schedule you with the eye doctor and foot doctor okay uh-huh </doctor> <patient> yeah so like a couple months ago i was in the office and they told me that i have asthma like i had it when i was a little kid and i thought i grew out of it but apparently not or like it came back or something so yeah so they just told me to come back today i don't really have like any issues uh so like i have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like i'm looking good athlete but i just couldn't go much faster and i was like saying i can't really breathe when i'm running that fast and then you know my mom was like you should probably go we should probably make an appointment yeah yeah like i will if i if i try to run fast like i kinda can't breathe anymore so i kind of stop or go slower if i stop doing like the thing i'm doing it i i don't know not very long like couple of minutes oh like sometimes when it's really cold outside i'll go out and like it my chest feels tight and just feel like i can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and i couldn't do it oh another time like i went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats i i felt like i got wheezy sound and i felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like i had to leave yeah mostly just with the cat we don't have a cat at my house so i didn't really think anything of it and then i went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and then at that time i could actually hear it uh no i don't think so like i have the uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time so yeah like i've been using it in gym class now well i'm a little confused now because i the 1 supposed to use like every day a couple times and then there was a different one that i thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work but now the nurse just told me that i'm supposed to use them both so i only got the one at the pharmacy so i don't really i don't really know i feel like a bit confused now but i always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day the one that starts with an s"" um but sometimes i just do it once a day if i forget the second one oh no no mostly like gym class like i said uh i don't think so like what do you mean when i was around the cats yeah but not the other times when i was a kid but not really now no ahh i don't i don't think so uh like no no uh no no no that's all good no what's that oh no um not that no no that's it like i broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast uh just like my wisdom teeth nothing else just just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin what i don't know like not that i thought but maybe like cats yeah i just thought like i had a cold but i guess like i usually feel like that in the springtime i think so like i've had all the stuff that i'm supposed to i think i don't know the names of everything you know like i live with my mom and dad and i like my little brother yeah um to to the the school um like high school down the road and i'm in grade 11 i like i like playing video games i was really wanting to join the marines and i was really trying to get into that stuff but then i heard like you can't when you have asthma oh so i i kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that uh what is that is that like when you breathe in that the tube yeah like the last time i was here like couple months ago i did that and it said that she said that my asthma was back i mean sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend i don't i don't drink a lot sorry i missed that oh well my mom always like makes me a lunch like i'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something i'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner it's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something i think it's like pretty normal uh like i have a girlfriend just with her uh like just recently yeah we started yeah yeah oh yeah every time it's not doing that many times but yeah no no like i had made out with other people before but this is like the first one uh no no no i haven't like may my dad i think he maybe had asthma when he was younger but like he doesn't really have it now mmmm like my dad also really dad gets like a runny nose in the spring so yeah i think that's allergies yeah thank you i really wanna know that like that was my plan and now i'm like kinda worried i can do that k thank you i've been following the a d a diet online and maxing out at around eighteen hundred calories per day a lot better actually my blood sugar isn't as high as it used to be i guess i'm alright i'm trying to see if this is big enough for my hand could you use this on either hand (laughter) hey i'm gonna don't send me no medicine this stuff ain't nothing i use it for four straight days and i ain't get nothing but a stomach ache no i ain't

<doctor> could you tell me what brought you in today ok uh so the first thing here would be uh like vital signs and assessing kind of stability so is there do we have this information ok so when did the symptoms specifically start ok and what started first ok so with this cough has there has there been any sputum come up ok any blood that you notice in the sputum ok uh and how was the fever checked ok and it has the temperature uh like has it has there been a fever the entire time ok um and in regards to the difficulties breathing as there been any like changes to like is there been any noisy breathing ok have you been hearing any like whistling sounds when when he's breathing in ok and has he been experiencing any other symptoms ok um has he been like well how's this appetite been ok so not not eating eating as much or drinking as much ok how has his behaviour been ok and inconsolable would you say yes ok and any bowel problems ok any vomiting ok and uh have you guys been around any anybody who's been sick ok so everybody else has been and been well alright any travel recently ok where did she go ok and how is grandma doing now ok and uh and he saw her he spent some time with her ok i see and i so in regards to a past health has he had any symptoms or like this before ok did they tell you what the diagnosis was at that time or just say that it was a viral infection ok um any reasons for hospitalizations ok um and any any medications that he takes regularly or uses regularly ok any allergies to medications that you're aware of ok and in regards to birth and prenatal history were there any complications throughout pregnancy ok and has mom had any complications with any prior pregnancies ok and uh was mom well throughout the pregnancy like no infectious symptoms during ok and then any concerns with either his vision or or hearing ok so if you um ok and and are his immunizations up to date ok and could you tell me a little bit about the living situation uh who's in the home currently and where you guys are living ok any pets at home oh cool and are there any concerns for like verbal abuse in the home how about any physical abuse in the home ok and does anybody smoke cigarettes in the home ok and then how about drink alcohol ok and who's the primary caregiver for him ok and um in the family are there any lung conditions like asthma or any heart conditions that run in the family ok and um does anybody um is there any congenital diseases that run in the family ok how about any genetic diseases ok and so um it's sounding like i wanted to do a work up for his symptoms right now for breathing heavily and with the fever that's concerning for a type of infection and with being under three months it would warrant some investigations so we'd want to check do some blood tests yeah and check his cerebrospinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection um in the brain i guess and what kind of go go from there ok um in the meantime yeah we'll give him some inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help with the lungs and breathing and then keep monitoring for how he's doing symptomatically you're welcome were there any was there anything else that i i missed to ask about ok um that sounds good so if there was nothing else that you wanted to share we will get that started and i i will be back shortly do you smoke sir do you drink are you married what do you do for living date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hi how you doing alright i didn't know that they were doing the surgery that quick yeah and i know that they were talking about you had a follow-up @@@ uh-huh do it during the winter yeah yeah that's right so you were up doing on the rehab floor for a little while too okay uh how are things going for instance are you able to walk around okay yeah when do you have follow up with the surgeons okay that's like a couple of weeks okay alright and i also saw you were in the er just last week yeah probably @@@ are you still taking the antibiotics yet okay your blood pressure looks good today it's been you know our main concern was the aneurysm so you're still going to have good blood pressure it still looks good today 10 mg 100 twice a day good okay okay so you're not taking the lisinopril okay and you're not taking simvastatin okay okay was your cholesterol pretty bad before yeah are you still having problems with your vision in the left eye okay are you still seeing the eye doc you know i wonder if it's not let me see what the surgeon said you're blood pressure's not bad but your pulse is a little bit low 56 cause before it would have been ideal uh do you ever feel like you get pauses in your like do you ever get lightheaded or dizzy okay okay okay did you ever do those cards the cards i sent @@@ yeah i don't see it at all how are you feeling in terms of @@@ urination with the prostate well it looks like your psa has been up a little bit the numbers that we check the prostate with @@@ when was the last time i saw you yeah this february your psa was a 7 up from 5 back in 2010 that's not a huge jump okay were you ever did we ever have you on finasteride or flomax how many times in the night do you get up and use the bathroom no weak stream or hesitancy do ever feel like your bladder is full and you can’t empty it yeah did you ever see the urologist they were supposed to do that chest ct some time around now to see if that mass has changed oh i see one january 13th preop so that was for the preop work-up okay it looks like it was unchanged well maybe they called that one mass at the outside hospital at a centimeter and a half and then when we rechecked it it was down to 5 millimeters it was about a third of the size and then now it's down to 3-4 millimeters so it's probably something we'd want to check again it's certainly not getting bigger if anything it's getting smaller so are you still taking the aspirin what about that bacteria that grew out of your urine was susceptible to the antibiotic @@@ and you didn't have fevers chills or anything like that any back low back pain after therapy alright okay how are you doing with your medicines do you have plenty of refills i'll take a look at you have you been having any chest pain or trouble breathing you can have a seat right there big deep breath any swelling in your hands or feet is there still a surgical scar oh gee that's healing nice got those stitches already out already healed up so you haven't noticed any drainage or anything like that out of it no it looks good well you know it's probably not a terrible pain that you quit taking the lisinopril the only thing i worry about is the metoprolol is what's called beta blockers and actually we use that to slow down people's heart rate and the blood pressure so we were @@@ pretty high for you so my question becomes maybe the lisinopril would be better than metoprolol because it’s only once a day because it slows your heart down a bit it's probably good to cut back on the dose of @@@ i'll kind of run that by my boss today let's see @@@ really is it painful hmm hmm when was the last time you saw cardiology alright give me about five minutes so i can go chat with my boss real quick i'll be right back alright well here's what i want to do blood pressure is really good we're shooting for less than 130 and we certainly got that on the top number the bottom number is actually a little bit low but if you don't have any symptoms it's probably not a huge deal but kind of like this low number and your pulse rate being a little bit low you're just kind of on the fence so we'll just stick with this you're not taking lisinopril right so thinking about maybe just cutting back on the metoprolol so you're taking 100 are you asking me yeah so yeah right now you're taking a pill twice a day so just take a half pill twice a day should be 12 hours though uh so we'll monitor you after that and the simvastatin if you don't want to take it and you want to try the diet and exercise i think that's okay and you're right on the borderline of your goal cholesterol so you know i don't think there's any problem we haven't we didn't check it we'll probably check it next time because you're on the borderline you know i honestly would like to see you on the medication but with diet and exercise it may come down but the next time you come back we'll check it okay um and then @@@ @@@ okay um so i don't need to see you back for maybe about three months i would like for you to come back in the next two or three weeks to take a blood pressure oh okay alright good so you'll be here next week so we'll check it next week @@@ you can get it done before you go to therapy just come up here and tell the nurses you're here for a blood pressure check and she'll take your blood pressure and you go and you won't have to wait @@@ we're basically cutting the metoprolol in half so i want to make sure it doesn't go high now you know i don't think it will but we'll check it and i think it'll be fine but yeah yeah tell me if you have any symptoms so those stool cards i don't know what happened i think there's @@@ because your blood count was so low that and @@@ they probably wouldn't accept them anyway and that may be what happened but you actually need the actual colonoscopy so @@@ yeah yeah we will wait on that for a few months okay okay let me give me just a couple more minutes alright the only real change we’re making is the half a pill otherwise i'll see you back in about four months and you've got a follow-up with the surgeons right @@@ and plenty of physical therapy yeah um next time you come in we'll check we'll check your cholesterol and we'll check your blood count you know your blood count's low it's probably because you had the surgery and you lose blood whenever you have a surgery and that can make it low yeah so um it probably was a little bit low but we'll see where it's at compared to today um these are going to be four months from now so uh yeah you don't have to worry about this before the next appointment and we'll be able to do some labs uh you know we're going to check it psa @@@ it didn’t go up high it is pretty pretty high but exactly so i mean it could be prostate cancer but given you've had no bph uh-huh that's what i mean i mean sometimes we can see a bump because you had other @@@ in february you were in the hospital so if you had a catheter in that trauma can raise your @@@ so we'll check your psa again when you come back in four months and that should give your prostate some time to settle down right oh is that right well we'll see what happens then alright i think everything is fine alright so we'll see you back in four months good luck with the uh with the therapy alright do you want me to show you the way out sure i'm going to see you now yeah alright will you be okay from here alright no problem we'll see you later okay </doctor> <patient> sure um so my my son he's 2 1/2 months old an were we're in the er because he's had this cough fever an seems like he's breathing too fast it's been happening for the past two days and we weren't sure what else to do for him we're going to say vitals stable he is on 2 litres of oxygen right now two days ago um so i guess he was coughing first and then we took his temperature and it seemed like he had a fever it was over 38 and then over the past couple of hours it seems like he's having a hard time breathing he's breathing too fast um yes yeah yellow sputum yeah no we did we did a rectal we checked twice we checked on the first day and then again last night i would say he sounds slightly wheezy i wouldn't say whistling no no um no he actually he hasn't gone through as many wet diapers as he normally does um not the greatest no yeah he's been very very fussy yeah no not that we noticed no no we haven't traveled recently um my mom so his grandma had traveled recently and he saw her last week mexico she's doing fine yeah mmhm he spent the day with her i guess last month he kinda had similar symptoms and they said it was a viral infection so he was just given some puffers to help his breathing and he got better on his own no they they said it could be bronchiolitis or just an upper viral infection at that time that he had the bronchiolitis or viral infection he was hospitalized for two days just to help his breathing uh he no no no no i wouldn't say so no it was normal everything was normal and he was a healthy baby no he's he's the first one he is the first one no no no he's been normal no uh yes they are yeah so we live in a house it's him myself and my husband his dad no pets no just well actually a goldfish no no no mmm we have like a glass of wine once a week i guess we both are yeah we both are um my sister so his aunt has asthma no no no sure yeah that sounds good ok thank you uh no i don't think so ok sounds good thank you no sometimes i take a beer or two for last ten years i install floor i am associated with a construction company and my main work is flooring installation yep fine how are you surprised huh yeah they uh well there was confusion cause actually in october i said let's go forward with it and somehow it got screwed up and it didn't actually end up when i wanted to do it cause i wanted to do it in december they were telling me it was gonna be two months worth of therapy and whatever and i just figured yeah but there wasn't that much weather we didn't have a winter yeah yeah the only reason i'm using the walker is between downstairs and the rehab up here and back down and whatever @@@ here but um yeah i'm not up to walking that much yet uh the 6th of april i believe it is yeah yep urinary tract infection which they said was probably due to the catheter @@@ while i was in the service @@@ uh yeah i got four more pills right sure and uh the other thing that i am taking as far as the medications that they’ve got me listed for i'm taking the amlodipine yep the metoprolol yep and uh the calcium and then i'm finishing out the antibiotics i'm not taking any of the other medications nope nope changed my diet i'm eating less than staying off of the red meat four or five times a week at the most i'm eating mostly fish and chicken and a lot of nuts and grains and stuff generally to watch the cholesterol that way i just don't want to be on the cholesterol medications no everything you gave me was just to reduce the blood pressure oh a little nothing i'm probably due to for another appointment he told me to come back in the spring of this year so i'm probably due i'm @@@ today but that seemed like when i work out and they're trying to get me straightened out other than that no and the i'm gonna say the metoprolol um if i end up taking it within a 12 hour span my uh pulse seems to be much more stronger and i think increased in rate as well yeah i sent them in i figured no news was good news oh fine i mean i'm probably up a little more often than usual at night i'm probably up twice during the night but i don't have any problem going or anything like that uh i believe it was in october probably i think the 7th uh also when they put me on a mostly regimented medication i stop taking my saw palmetto uh no i was on flomax with my other doctor for a while usually once no never when i gotta go i gotta go and it's over yeah @@@ they did a ct just prior to the surgery and they said that they basically should be able to see if from that i believe it would've been february 10th i haven't been they didn't want me to take it before surgery and i haven't started taking it again yeah after therapy yeah and just when i went to the hospital they gave me another pile of them plus i had them at home so i'm good for a couple of three months nope okay no yeah come on now you don’t need to ask that do you um a couple times there was a little but once the stitches were it seemed like it was all over but that was the way it was @@@ oh oh now the um metoprolol um like you say if i go taking it as an unusual problem or something i end up like 14 hours between the pills then uh i mean i noticed my heartbeat significantly different is there a um a point where that would back off i mean no because it's i mean i can feel it rather than the when the @@@ like right now i don't even feel it but like i say if i go 14 or 15 hours without it uh i mean i have gone uh like on a trip or something and gone 18 hours then obviously it doesn't seem to get any worse or i just i don't know what that it gets any better i never really paid any attention i’m not sure it’s been a year okay no problem right it's a split pill just got to break it in half okay yeah sure the exercise is definitely gonna help because i didn't exercise at all before and now at least i'm back to how's my good cholesterol okay that’s fair next time i'll see if i can't do it with diet and exercise then i'm okay with it cause i used to be on it and still it was up cause then you will know you don’t know if diet and exercise aren't doing it the pills are doing it @@@ 55 miles @@@ up near the wisconsin border okay that might work cause i'm coming in twice a week for therapy yep okay yeah oh if i notice any really change in the heart rate or anything i guess i'll call and tell you let's wait till i get straightened out a little bit here first okay pardon okay right yep that's my goal my goal is to not run a marathon not to go square dancing just to get to stand up and walk again and i'm getting there i actually got a transfusion and iron because it was low and they took four vials of blood on saturday in the emergency room i don't know what they were checking for but you should have some information it's always been high my original position i was at 9.8 and i'll go back on the saw palmetto and see what now it was 9.8 that would have been probably maybe 12 years ago i went on saw palmetto then and it dropped it from 9.8 to 3.4 yeah i’ll be walking by then next time i won’t be using the chair well i said maybe i'll definitely be doing it can @@@ maybe yeah if you don't mind i don't want to tear your doors up and everything else and check out at this okay forward i can do pretty good backwards i don't have a rearview mirror yeah thanks doctor yep time is 1:35 dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@

<doctor> what brings you in ok so all of this started a day ago you mentioned ok uhm and you mentioned his fever was 38 correct ok is he coughing at all ok and is he bringing up any phlegm ok any blood in there does he sound wheezy ok ok does he look swollen to you in his uh like uh legs arms or belly area no ok and uh does he have a runny nose or a stuffy nose no ok how is his feeding ok ok and how about like the number of wet diapers he has ok ok good have you noticed any changes to his bowel movements or urine ok is he throwing up at all ok ok have you noticed any rashes on him ok uhm has he had any fainting spells or seizures ok ok good has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently for sure any travel to anywhere recently ok and is he an other-wise healthy baby ok ok and so he didn't need any hospitalizations right after birth right and no longstanding medical conditions after birth has he needed hospitalizations for anything in the past or surgeries ok and is he up to date with all his immunizations ok good medication-wise is he on anything ok any allergies any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions ok any cancers in the family and who does he live with at home ok uhm in a house apartment ok any old carpets mold dust asbestos pets anything like that at home ok and does anyone at home smoke ok well those were all the questions i had for you did you have any questions of your own yeah so the grunting is worrisome he could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is we'll first get his temperature we'll get his o2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia if it's bronchiolitis it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen and if it's pneumonia we'll prescribe him some antibiotics how does that sound yeah so for now because if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen and iv hydration he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint i should also mention we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well so we'll have to do that to rule it out yeah no worries any difficulty in swallowing any nausea vomiting or blood in your vomit okay any stomach pain okay date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ okay what brings you in today okay what's the number one complaint the arm pain and uh why haven't you seen the regular doctor they didn't schedule you or anything um now you tell me you were in the er and they wanted you to be admitted so who was your main doctor before have you been taking your medications are you getting any chest pain right now um so you have left arm pain how long has the left arm pain been going on uh is it worse when you use it any rash have you injured your arm in any way is it worse if you get up if you're walking around you're doing a flight of stairs or something yeah how much activity do you ever go up the stairs at all like uh okay um and you don't walk much have you walked into how did you get here did you walk from the parking lot so walking from the parking lot here did you get short of breath okay do you do housework at all do you get short of breath with that okay okay when you've had chest pain can you describe it for me okay how long does it last where is it worse where is it okay when was the last time you took plavix i mean clopidogrel okay now are you using the insulin simvastatin it's a cholesterol medication are you still smoking or no okay how long have you been coughing did you eat anything this morning do you want to pick up these medications today or have them sent to you are you still taking the iron how about the doxazosin are you having much urinary trouble and what were the ones that you need today i'm sorry the plavix or the clopidogrel what have your sugars been running have you been getting low at all how long have you been taking the insulin you started it when are you still smoking have you tried hydrochlorothiazide in the past it's a medication for blood pressure okay have you been checking your blood pressure at home no alright i'm going to increase the lisinopril to 40 and start you on a medication; well i'll probably start you on another one the hydrochlorothiazide okay and i also want you to see the cardiologist again um i don't think that chest pain sounds terribly cardiogenic but um shortness of breath is a little more concerning you know you had a positive stress test in the past and you know sometimes we can do an angiogram um have you ever had an angiogram before they go in through the groin to take a look at the heart vessels okay you want to sit up there well you know i think we want to make sure you know you're not having any major um increased blockage in the heart now i think last time they thought that was unlikely based on the stress test um but you may they may need to do an angiogram okay because of your diabetes and if there was a major blockage and you needed to undergo you know good severe disease then they may need to maybe either put a stent in or do a bypass i don't think right now you're not getting anything acute i don't think you're having a heart attack or anything like that but there could be a little bit of angina um so i think you should be seen by them again you've only seen them once is that correct okay take some deep breaths any sores on your legs concerns about your feet or anything like that okay if it doesn't look worse than that if it starts you know if it doesn't heal in a week or so then let us know okay @@@ up alright um any stomach pain when i press @@@ alright you can sit in the chair alright uh so you know you've been talking for three months i just need to ask you a little bit more about that i've got to write down the other stuff is it a dry cough or you do okay so i want to do a chest x-ray today um and then um you know the medication you're on the lisinopril that can cause a cough i mean and uh it can happen any time yeah do have any runny nose or it could also be postnasal drip from allergies okay where everything comes down you say your nose has been stuffy and draining okay well we can try that too um there's medications for it okay so i'm going to give you this nasal there's a nasal inhaler um it's called flonase when have you taken it well i think it could help and then we'll get a chest x-ray today uh you can get labs done while you’re here okay and then let me see your arms the left arm have you been taking anything for this i think you can try some tylenol where does the pain go okay does it hurt when i press on that okay uh well you know usually these things are musculoskeletal and benign uh i think you should try some tylenol first and maybe do some ice to it and uh see what that; you could just do just over-the-counter tylenol; it's cheaper if you buy it yeah tylenol is safe from that standpoint so you know don't take it more than like four times a day though um and then they did a chest x-ray in the er when you were there but uh they only did the one view with the portable machine i mean those aren't the best x-rays especially for us so we'll get a real one and have you go down and get it after you whichever line is shorter you can get them both done today um yes and then i'll take care of the meds we're going to switch you on a different i'm going to take you off that lisinopril and put you on something else a similar medication that doesn’t cause the cough in case that's what's doing it okay alright um and i want you to come back like in three months and you can see me and i put a note in for the cardiologist to see you um so that should be scheduled if not if they don't get hold of you in a week or so give them a call cause definitely i want you to see them cause you know you may need an angiogram um okay alright take care </doctor> <patient> yeah so i just brought my son went to the hospital i've just been getting very concerned because he's making like these like grunting noises for the last day and like it's it's really worrying me i don't know if he's like not breathing and i also just did like a temperature on him just this morning and it came up to like like a high 38 so i don't know what's going on and then he's just very like irritable and just not himself i think yeah it started yesterday but the grunting started today like i think he was a bit on the warmer side last night as well more irritable last night but the grunting started this morning yeah i think it was like 38 7 or something like that uhm yeah i would say with the grunting there is some coughing in between as well uhm he's been having some spit ups as well they're mainly like clear and whitish but yeah i don't know if he's bringing anything else up there's no green or yellow material though no i haven't notice any blood uh no it's mainly just the grunting uh swollen as in just uh like in his no i don't think so no i don't think so yeah it's it's been difficult so right now like his mom is at home but she was having difficulty feeding he's mainly breastfed right now and he's not really been feeding too much either just the normal like that hasn't changed he has like three or four in a day no pretty much been the same nope just some spit ups i don't know if that's just because of the coughing or if they're just spit ups like but nothing after eating no no rashes uh no i've been really trying to make sure like i was worried if he gets blue or something that we would rush to the emergency department but i haven't noticed anything like that no i don't think so we've been trying to be very careful with the pandemic and everything going on no yeah so uh healthy but he was born premature at 36 weeks and no complications really with the pregnancy or after he was born but yeah he was premature no he was fine after birth no no nothing like that yeah the two months vaccinations are all up to date no no medications no no not that we know of nope just me and my wife in a house no nothing like that nope yeah no i was just really worried like the grunting is just really scaring us so do you i was just wondering if you know what it could be yeah and will he need to stay in the hospital at all ok yeah that sounds good uh uh yeah thank you so much no no no vomit at all no problem there no i haven't seen my regular doctor for probably about six or seven months uh actually i was in the emergency room a couple weeks ago with um pain in my arms and my chest and uh now i notice that i'm having uh bouts of headaches along with continued limb pain and some chest pain and uh a lot of coughing yeah the arm pain i haven't been something like that yeah and i uh when i went there the problem had been going on for about three days but after i was in the emergency i wasn't experiencing that same problem so i didn't feel like i could stay in the hospital for something that i didn't feel like it was a problem at the time i couldn't even tell you sir it just seems like every year i get a new doctor i get seen by them once or twice and then i get another new one the ones that i can get i have run out of clopidogrel i have no more prescriptions available for metoprolol and i'm down to my last i have no more refills for my glipizide and only one refill remaining for my metformin and just keeping up with what i'm taking it's just impossible trying to do this online and order no names just numbers not at this moment no oh totally for about a month maybe six weeks it's just it feels like it's under the skin maybe in the veins and it has nothing to do with using the arm or not none noticed no it's not always in the arm sometimes i just feel you know just short of breath just general walking i'm in sales so i don't do a lot not really from the parking lot yeah i didn't park that far away i was pretty close on occasion i haven't done any housework lately i haven't done anything to exert myself only just walking on the lot to find a car i want to say you know like a quick stabbing or pressure uh like someone pushing on my chest seconds it's usually in the left side what's plavix uh two days ago i ran out yes i'm up to 18 units per day simvastatin i don't know about that i'm not sure if it's required i'm not missing any of my meds maybe my night medication just because i'm so tired when i come from work i just get home and pass out rather than taking more medicine no i haven't smoked in almost two years that's why i'm complaining about the cough uh only about three months that's actually one thing my wife thinks that we should find out what that is and it doesn't matter whether i'm at work or whether i'm at home i get really severe coughing from time to time not yet usually about 10 o'clock is when i have breakfast uh the ones i run out i especially need to pick up yes i have taken it i take it yeah i'm still going frequently at night and glipizide i probably got about two weeks left and metoprolol uh; i don't have any more prescriptions available for that i've probably got about a week's worth left last time i did take the time to check they were in the high 100s like almost 200 yeah a few times it's gotten low three months maybe last um the doctor i saw last time she actually had me seen in the diabetes educator a couple times so there may be notes in there from her no i can't remember what it is i've only taken lisinopril for blood pressure no i'm not sure right okay yeah okay yes just once not on the feet i banged my leg a few days ago and just seems to be taking a longer time than normal to heal no okay yeah mostly it's dry and eventually i get some phlegm up uh-huh okay cause i haven't been quit smoking for almost two years now and almost immediately after i stopped smoking i started having the cough until recently at sometimes yeah okay yes i've taken that before uh years ago okay no i try to avoid taking over-the-counter meds usually it's just going through the muscle and it feels like it's just under the skin not really uh-huh i'm a internal bleeder okay yeah uh-huh right okay so you want some lab work and x-rays right okay okay okay okay okay alright okay doc time is 10 o'clock

<doctor> i was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency department ok where is the pain located ok and when did this pain start ok i am how would you describe the pain sometimes people will use words like burning dull achy ok and um anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse ok and do you feel the pain anywhere else or is it just on the left side of your chest ok and has the pain been getting worse staying the same or getting better ok and do you have any other associated symptoms ok um has anything like this ever happened to you before ok are you did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike ok so any injuries to the head ok ok excellent and any headache right now ok how about any fever chills any nausea or vomiting do you feel as though your heart's racing ok any skin changes or or rashes you've noticed ok and do you have a cough ok and any recent infections ok and uh any dizziness alright and i know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands but any other injuries oh ok and any alcohol or drug intake prior to falling off your bike ok and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed alright and when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink ok and how many hours ago was that ok um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past any allergies to medications ok uh and any hospitalizations any surgeries ok anybody in the family who have any illnesses ok and how do you support yourself currently financially ok and do you smoke ok and do you smoke marijuana ok and do you drink alcohol ok thank you do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family that i should be aware of what about cancer does anyone in your family have a history of cancer date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ okay alright that's good alright how's everything going today okay okay okay right @@@ okay well it sounds like you have arthritis in your back and um yeah yeah just by what you’re telling me you know we could still look okay well one thing at a time though and we haven't seen you in a follow-up visit in quite some so today let's just kind of get you plugged back into the system uh it looks like you're on you know a number of medications for blood pressure diabetes asthma uh probably what we're gonna follow you here in the general medicine clinic for what do you take for your blood pressure uh-huh it is metoprolol okay how about the diabetes what are you taking for it how much do you take uh-huh okay uh and what have your sugars been running is that before you eat or after you eat okay what are they usually before you eat so before you eat the blood sugars are higher do you happen to have blood sugar journal okay it doesn't make any sense okay well it depends how stable they are you know if your blood sugars are usually stable then you only need to probably check twice a day but if they're kind of up and down you should check more than that well it depends you know hang on any episodes of low sugars okay good alright now asthma wise how's your breathing uh what are you taking for the asthma okay sure no problem okay we can definitely do that um so like i said you know i was with this visit i'd really like to get you plugged back into the system let's establish some you know baseline diabetes labs on your let's check an average sugar level let's refill your meds your blood pressure was very good today and i hope you're very happy about that uh and then we need to do some health maintenance things uh you're over the age of 50 so you need a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer well they take a fiberoptic camera; it's about the size of a pen they put it up your bottom where we know @@@ colon cancer cause really it's a very good test it saves lots of lives so i would recommend it um the other thing is that if you're a diabetic you need an eye exam once a year so i want to schedule you for an eye exam okay and then uh the third thing is that uh we'll check the cholesterol today so alright alright let's just see if there's anything else that we need now this back pain i’m happy to do an x-ray we don't have one in the system so let's do an x-ray to start out with before we jump to an mri and then we'll go from there okay well if you'll have a seat let me take a look at you here where you living these days okay @@@ i hear you i got it alright show me where you're having most of the pain would you say is it worse when you walk or sit or stand hmm some deep breaths nice deep breaths just breathe normal for me are you able to examine your feet every day can you take your shoes and socks off so i could see them you can sit back down there yeah uh the reason we're so adamant about this is diabetes is the number one cause of amputations in this country so it's very important for all diabetics to check their feet every day to be very careful about any kind of ulcers that develop yeah i want both of them you gotta check both of them well lotion is not as important you really just you gotta make sure that there's no ulcers we see i see tons of diabetics who've lost feet legs all that kind of stuff it's the diabetes the high sugar levels gets into the nerves and it destroys the nerves of the feet okay and that's what people need some amputations how's your feeling over here can you feel this okay how about this side can you feel this yeah so we'll schedule you for these tests um and then uh we'll see you back uh you know after all these tests are done and then you know we'll uh you know kind of reconvene see what they show and go from there oh let's see you need a colonoscopy eye exam these labs and we'll get the x-ray so it's gonna be by the time you get all these appointments and the tests are done and back in the computer it's gonna be about a couple of months so we'll see you probably back in two months in the meantime i'll make sure you got enough medicines uh do you have a psychiatrist good good good good good yeah yeah alright alright let me get some papers here for you and i'll be right back yes sir @@@ insulin titration okay you're going to give this to the lady at the front desk who will give you these appointments right on the way out uh the eye clinic uh gi clinic that's the colonoscopy okay and then i want you to come back and see the pharm-d the pharmacist in two weeks and when you come back for this make sure you bring your glucometer your blood sugar diary so we can titrate your insulin yeah they'll give you all these appointments today but i'm just kind of letting you know i'll refill your stuff uh they won't release your medicine until you get your blood drawn to make sure you're yeah okay oh no problem my pleasure @@@ okay there you go you need this uh yes sir take care get the x-ray right over here straight up </doctor> <patient> so i came to the emergency department because i've been having pain in my chest i would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest so i think it started just around 2 hours ago i actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on kind of just slipped and i think i fell on that side like when i the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful i think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area if i think i have to take really really slow and shallow breaths if i try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small smaller breaths helps no i would say just on the left side i'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse uh like i think i i'm having also maybe it's just because i'm trying to breathe slowly but i feel like i can't catch my breath no no i mean i've never had any pain in my chest before no i got right back up i just just had the pain no that's fine i was wearing a helmet no no i feel i'm fine nope i would say like in the last hour a little bit more so than usual besides just i got some scrapes here and there on my hands but nothing else nope no i've been pretty pretty healthy recently no no cough or no infections um no oh no i i think i got a pretty lucky oh no no i was completely sober no no drugs or alcohol um no nothing like that i just had some cereal and um just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else i would say around 3 hours ago uh not other than just a hay fever but nothing nothing else i have like a lot of allergies oh just sometimes when i take like a nasal spray i think i might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines i think i get some allergies from them no never nope just my father he has type 2 diabetes but nothing else oh so i work just as like a mechanic just in the city and currently i just have myself to support i live alone in an apartment so i'm doing fairly well i smoke around like i'd say 2 and a half to 3 packs per day i know it's yeah i have tried quitting before but i would say i've been smoking since i was 18 no no no marijuana no other drugs yeah it's just like sometimes on the weekend i'll just have a beer or two while watching the game but not nothing regular yes um i know some of my relatives have had coronary artery disease and um high blood pressure no that doesn't ring any bells yeah i know you guys get in trouble keeping my appointments you know what was happening @@@ chicago i was out in la for forty years i came back to chicago 2008 @@@ west la so i'm in a slumber house wake up in the morning and got out of bed and just felt the worst pain that i ever felt in my life come to find out i had two slipped disks l4 and l5 back in chicago i’ve been back since august 2008 and due to my i had issues with substance abuse uh un stabile lifestyle and i'm gonna i can be this concise i can focus but this back is killing me i haven't gotten it taken care of yet now i had an mri and a uh some x-rays at west la va before i came home in august 2008 i don’t know if you can pull that up but here i think i've had at least the x-rays done on the back but didn't get an mri at jesse brown since i've been back in chicago and i really want to get this taken care of it's really bothering me it's just i mean the last you know what i was @@@ how did you come to this conclusion did you just just by your knowledge yeah someone said that i had an x-ray done at a hospital and they said they pretty much thought it was arthritis too exactly exactly okay sounds good doc quite a list okay i take uh lisinopril i think its 40 mg once a day and metoprolol i can't pronounce it yeah i take uh i don't how much is the medicine but it should be in the computer on my yeah they put me on insulin the last time i was here the doctor put me on insulin i take 48 of 70/30 novolog 48 in the morning and 46 at night my sugar's been running from like 130 to 160 170 which is a little high but this is after i eat before i eat they go to 190 210 220 um okay let me think about this um i didn't bring it with me i forgot the glucometer i left that at home but usually the sugars they're higher before i eat in other words after i okay when i test my blood sugar before i take the insulin it's usually high 130 140 its usually out of the normal range and so i'm testing basically once twice a day is that good or should i be testing more often but uh okay so maybe i need to do what uh four times a day well they've been running pretty decent in other words i cut back and you know there's some things i know i can do i cut back on the cheating no my breathing has been uh it's been good i haven't had an asthma attack in a couple of years asthma i take the steroid inhaler and the proventil inhaler i'm out of my inhaler yeah i need some med refills okay okay i understand okay okay okay okay now what does that entail the colonoscopy is that when they i know there's a couple of ways they can go but they use the instrument uh-huh okay okay okay okay sure yeah i need it yeah i need it cause i need new glasses anyway so that would be good okay okay okay i'm living in harvey with my sister on 55th and 3rd on

and also of the uh long bones so of your femur um as well as your leg too uh and because right now we um most likely think is called something um an osteochondroma um which is the most common uh primary benign bone tumour um however there are other things that it it could be um and so such as like an osteoma or um an endochondroma um so we'll we'll want to um get that x-ray and um kind of go go from there alright so we'll get that we'll get that ordered good morning ma'am you're eighty two years old is that correct good and just one more piece of background information which hand do you write with good so what seems to be the problem today what kind of treatments have you had can i assume the pain is impacting your daily life @@@ how's everything going good your vital signs look great your blood pressure is good okay um sorry the computer is saying that i still haven’t call you back are you having any problems really nope take all your medicines as you should okay oh good you're very organized uh any recent weight loss or anything like that chest pain shortness of breath abdominal pain no do you get a flu shot yeah did you get one okay yeah it's plus/minus uh there haven't been that many side effects so if you like feel comfortable taking it it's kind of nice cause they offer it here um and people you're age don’t seem to be getting it that much they think you’ve probably been exposed to it before but when they do get they can just get sicker yeah i mean and there are some people i know that @@@ alright everything looks pretty good let me see if your labs are in cold outside huh me too yeah @@@ okay no they're not back yet uh uh-huh are you having any symptoms any coughs or shortness of breath no oh a lump i don’t see anything no @@@ okay it's been there since you were young then since you were in vietnam it's been that long okay younger i should say younger then and the same age i am now alright can you hop up here for me i'll take a look take a deep breath and again okay (knock on the door) i'm doing good yeah okay @@@ you got your lab work oh okay uh-huh yeah yeah um is this because you @@@ smoking or what is the reason uh-huh uh-huh @@@ oh it's the ct scan where’d you have that @@@ pulmonary okay @@@ cancer it hasn’t been a year yet yeah maybe in may that's @@@ year so yeah @@@ smoking are you interested quitting smoking yeah no i know @@@ yeah i know it's definitely just a habit i think you're absolutely right with that just having something in your hands and open your mouth for me a little bit now can you lay back pain in your belly nothing like that okay do you have pain in your belly okay what did they find when they did that oh diverticulitis yeah diverticulitis that can cause pain up in this area the pain @@@ you can hop down but they found it later oh really when was that the pain is gone since sure uh-huh depending on what cancer it is um do you have a specific cancer in mind that spine like bone cancer or what it kind of depends on the type of cancer cause some cancers are really aggressive right so you can have them grow really fast right it does seem like colon cancer that can start out with something like a polyp real slow like up to ten years so it kind of really depends on the actual types of cancer @@@ spinal symptoms oh no so was it just diagnosed what kind of cancer really how old is she @@@ um yeah that @@@ absolutely like do they tell everyone about them is that what you mean yeah i’m not seeing it in the media as much you're absolutely right except it's not that we um that's sort of definitely the warning signs right when you have symptoms probably but unfortunately they’ve found so many different studies to see where it is beneficial to screen people prior to having symptoms so certain stuff we do for women we do mammograms and we do pap smears @@@ right but you haven't had one in a while but sometimes when people get older they opt not to have it anymore um yeah i think i didn’t see any of the lab tests are you getting the rectal exams too you have oh okay you have one you had one in september you had a blood test that if you're still getting the rectal exam @@@ no so he did it last time okay let me go see if i can @@@ yeah and you saw him in like september didn't you we'll see @@@ alright okay @@@ do you get everything by mail then you're not out right oh really yeah you’re out of some of your medications like your folic acid and stuff i'm just gonna renew those do you still take medications for anxiety @@@ who gives you that okay are you going to see him soon and you’re still taking atenolol for blood pressure right right @@@ okay went up okay so you take that amlodipine also right do you still take the potassium uh-huh it was probably your potassium was low probably yeah so do you take that regularly your potassium is still a little low uh-huh and @@@ okay um green leafy vegetables okay here are the foods that have lots of potassium in them @@@ start eating more of that how are you @@@ tells me all the good things you’re doing but you know working on your blood pressure and your @@@ yeah okay and then um so um i think you're going in the right direction but we just want to get you doing better okay okay right alright @@@ should i have him come back for the blood testing or you have a blood pressure monitor at home right @@@ at home okay um so we’re just going to you had a little bit of protein in your urine uh it's not bad because your kidney function is normal but @@@ on the lisinopril it’s usually supposed to be protective of the kidneys from some of the blood pressure medicines you're on so you're on half a tablet right now we're going to increase it yeah and then you can go up to one tablet um just check your blood pressure at home though and if you have any problems if your blood pressure drops or anything just go back down to half a tablet okay sound good um and then sometimes that can help increase your the potassium too so that's what we're hoping uh and then otherwise there’s this one @@@ move class um to help with weight loss and @@@ hypertension and diabetes @@@ and they can help you lose weight @@@ and everything looks good did you have the pneumonia shot this summer last year beautiful yeah @@@ we’ll see you back in like three months okay yeah we could do it uh-huh alright have a good one </doctor> <patient> uh i i'm uh just coming into the clinic uh today uh my parents told me to come today i don't know what this thing is just mass right below or kind of like a lump or mass below my right knee and it's not painful or anything it's a little bit uncomfortable but i just want to check out and see what it might be so i think i noticed it um for the first time um probably a couple weeks ago i would say like two weeks ago i i noticed it so it's it's uh below my knee uh right on like uh i feel it on the big big bone right below the knee it's um yeah i just feel like uh like a hard lump no it's not really uh that painful it's uh it's if i press on it it's a little bit uncomfortable but it's not like i wouldn't call it pain uh no not that i can remember i don't think i've had any injuries there and this lump is like probably like 2 to 3 centimetres it's i don't even know like when it appeared or why it appeared i haven't really injured myself or anything no uh no not that i can remember no i haven't felt any of those no no weakness no uh no night sweats no no i've been pretty well recently no nothing like that uh no nothing like that no no no nothing like that um no no nausea or vomiting nope um no no no changes at all no not anything that i've noticed um no my energy's been fine no i mean like all the other joints and other like bones and muscles have been fine it's just even i wouldn't describe this as pain it's just uh i think my parents got a bit concerned um since there was like a lump they were scared and i was a little bit scared too so i just came in to check it out um no i've been pretty healthy up until now uh no no medications no yeah all my immunizations are up to date no i haven't had uh any hospitalizations or surgeries yeah so i'm living um with my parents and older brother um and we live in a just a house um right outside of the city no i i don't work i'm currently in school right now so yeah too busy with school and then just extracurricular activities no no we've all just been at home no i haven't tried um any drugs or anything like that no no i haven't uh no we like um me and my brother feel safe at home school is going well too um i'm pretty pretty athletic at school like uh i have good friends so no bullying or anything like that feels pretty safe overall um i don't think anything related to this but um i know my my dad has diabetes um and my mom has uh some anxiety um i don't think anyone's had like a bone tumour or anything like that i i know my uncle um he he does have a he had like melanoma which he had to get surgically removed um not that i've been told no no i've been like uh no no pain no i can walk just fine no issues there no no nothing like that it's just uh i can tell there's like a lump there and if i press it i can feel like the hard lump but um no changes in the skin above it no um nothing like that um no not that i can tell yeah it just feels weird i don't i'm not in any pain or anything but it's like it's weird to look at and then weird to feel uh as well yeah no i can move everything just fine yeah no i um nothing else i wanted to add but i i think my parents and i were just scared about it being like uh cancer or like a tumour um so i just don't know what i should do if i need to get any tests done or x-rays or anything like that okay uh yeah that that sounds good alright perfect thank you so much good morning doctor yes that's correct i use my right hand for everything doctor i've had years of pain in this shoulder well um i've had antiinflammatories and

when i just got here @@@ uh-huh oh i'm running out of this too by the way i brought it with me @@@ got to be clean no h1n1 i got the regular flu shot i think i might go over and get the h1n1 oh they says people my age right right oh @@@ yeah yeah i thought it was gonna warm up but um that's the weatherman for you but one of the reasons i get a chest x-ray every year other than the fact that i smoke @@@ anyway but i'm a retired chemist and i worked around some pretty uh carcinogenic and toxic chemicals plus i was exposed to agent orange no you know i really don't have any is it on that side or this side no not that there's a discoloration in the skin in vietnam they had that agent orange laying on the ground and this whole part of my face broke out and i noticed it maybe that's a visual effect or whatever i don't know it's not giving me any problem i just happen to notice it yeah it @@@ young @@@ uh-huh yeah i did it earlier this morning you know can i ask you something the last time not this when we talked the other day but uh you know i didn't get the chest x-ray what was the determination do you think it's necessary this year or no not just smoking i told you you know i'm a retired chemist and i used to work around uh real carcinogenic materials and uh i was exposed to agent orange also i'm not having any problems you know if i had some i'd like to get it quick but i did i had that uh lung uh what was that uh in nuclear medicine no that's a lung thing in nuclear medicine yeah well @@@ it okay that was the reason interested in what uh i should but uh you know like i

and then i got uh diverticulitis yeah but i damn near died about five years ago oh yeah let me ask you a question it ain't got nothing to do with me generally when you have cancer carcinoma how long does it take that to grow uh-huh uh spinal yeah like lung cancer spreads to the nodule no i was just asking cause of my sister right hmm yeah well they say it spread all over uh it's uh terminal well yeah they just found it lately well they said she had a mass on her spine uh her liver lungs it's just you know metastasizing all over now 77 i’ve been through this quite a few times with family members @@@ years ago they used to give um used to harp on the seven warning signs of the different forms of cancer and they backed away from that or maybe i just like if it was a lung cancer you know coughing problems blood or whatever colon cancer you know there's blood in the stool are they still harping on those seven warning signs well it used to be fucking media thing right that's what i'm saying but generally when you got through uh physical metamorphosis that means that if you know it's gotten to the point you know i don't know what stage you would call it right uh-huh yeah for a man it’s a psa i had one last year didn’t i yeah uh-huh i don't know why right is name still here yes digital rectal examination i got all these intentions yeah i get them by mail all intentions of making

age you are still obviously nowhere close to that but it's i i don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either so it's best if you get it done earlier and let's go back to your symptoms then

caused by bacteria or viruses it could be something like um mono or it could be um strep throat um it could be other things as well um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid we would also like to do a covid test um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result do you have any questions ok sounds good what brings

take the @@@ you basically need refills on everything @@@ which doctor prescribed this for you okay i'm going to let this doctor refill this medicine for you because he has all your records from your psychiatric @@@ i feel more comfortable asking him refill this medicine i'm not a psychiatrist i can give you @@@ but he has been following you for that i want to leave it up to him if he wants to speak to me anytime for other medicines that @@@ i'm totally fine with that @@@ are you checking your blood pressure at all home you're not are you checking um blood sugars okay um @@@ has it been low okay like when does that happen you're not eating and that's what happens or when you're not eating you got to be sure to eat three meals a day @@@ how long @@@ once a week twice a week um have you

well you got one coming up hmm (doctor makes phone call to gi.) so we'll figure out the aspirin um okay oh let me take a look at your feet @@@ okay do you feel that on the left and there now i just want to let you know right here yeah the big thing is smoking um i can't stress to you know how important it is to quit we don’t know why you had a stroke and on top of that you also had sensation in your chest pain @@@ cause a heart attack no it was @@@ coronary arteries it's so you have a bunch of arteries that run through your heart and it's inside of heart @@@ blood @@@ heart muscle after a heart attack if you have some plaque within those coronary arteries or cholesterol and @@@ weakening vessel wall and what happens is your smoking can cause clotting of the artery causes a heart attack and kills the heart muscle around it we caught yours before before it causes the clot and it's a good thing we did but one of the reasons you had that is because you smoke so you're at risk for another heart attack; you're also at risk for another stroke um it increases your risk tremendously just by smoking on top of that your lungs you know 5-10 years down the road that also have what is called emphysema copd if you don't already have a little bit now if you continue to smoke that'll just get worse if you stop smoking any lethal damage to your lungs it might not heal but the lungs won't get worse does that make sense and you're setting yourself for some major problems if you continue to smoke yeah um give me a couple of minutes and i will be back okay @@@ look at viagra are you sexually active any more at all um okay are you having problems with erections is it sustaining an erection or getting an erection cause the viagra won't help with sustaining it it will help with getting an erection again i think i would ask the cardiologist and just have him @@@ um @@@ blood pressure can affect the heart and i don't think you know that it's a problem @@@ something that the viagra would help um and i’m trying to think of what else @@@ we can do labs today and @@@ okay give me a couple of minutes @@@ okay @@@ change a couple of the medicines a little bit @@@ (doctor working on computer) uh let me see @@@ you're all set this is omeprazole; i'm going to change it to something called pantoprazole @@@ plavix @@@ @@@ um and then the other thing too @@@ so i'm going to

<doctor> how can i help you today ok so for the when it first presented about four to five days ago what did you notice notice first ok now was this with any type of activity or just at rest ok has she ever had anything like this before nothing like that ok and has it been fairly steady since then or has it been fluctuating ok but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later has she had any fevers at home has she had a runny nose at all at home has she seemed well otherwise does she look sick ok and has she had any sick contacts recently anyone around her or her friends been sick ok any recent travel anywhere ok but she's still been going to school i suppose playing with her friends ok have you noticed any rashes any skin changes anywhere on her body ok nothing like that has she complained of any pain anywhere ok and has she had any recent infections ok so nothing really needing antibiotics in the last couple of years and in terms of how she's been doing has she been keeping up with her peers in terms of education and how she moves how she acts ok so does she have a family physician ok so they haven't brought up any concerns about how she's growing how she's developing so her weight her height they've been good for her age excellent and has she gotten has she been keeping up to date for immunizations excellent in regards to how she's doing otherwise health in terms of her health has did she see a family physician for any other medical issues that she might be having ok how was the birth was there any complications when she was born ok so nothing when you were pregnant with her no toxic congestions by that i mean um did you drink any alcohol smoke at all when you were pregnant with her no ok and you just had antenatal care so you saw doctor for ultrasounds and just for checkups ok and when she was born she didn't have to stay in the hospital at all and was she born uh what weight was she when she was born 8 kilos yeah no worries and then otherwise she is so she's been healthy otherwise been doing well uh just in terms of how she's been doing uh with other systems of her body have you noticed any concerns for her bowel movements ok any concerns for peeing and we already talked she hasn't had any fevers when she coughs does she ever bring anything up ok and when she's having these wheezy episodes do you ever notice that she looks like she's really straining to breathe really struggling ok so these usually recover on their own you don't give her anything for it ok uh does she have any allergies ok do you give her anything for seasonal allergies ok so she doesn't have any allergies where her face swells up or she has trouble breathing ok and this these episodes mainly happen when she's playing with friends so do they happen in a certain environment like for example is this in a friends house or is this outdoors or has it been across different settings ok and do these episodes ever happen in your home and what's the context from them happening in your home ok so she doesn't have any symptoms at rest and she doesn't have any symptoms at night ok and did she wake up at night with that or just ok alright so we already talked about so she doesn't really have any past medical issues that she's seen a doctor for uh any surgeries ok is she taking medications right now aside from the occasional reactine and she's in school ok and does she live with you ok do you two live in a house in town ok and what do you two do for work ok excellent and this is a question we just ask everyone has there ever been any cc cas involvement in the family and does anyone smoke in the household ok uh do you keep any carpets or pets in the household so no pets no dogs ok any wood burning fireplaces stoves in the household and changed your air filters alright excellent so i think i have all the information i need we're just going to do a physical exam and then i'm going to go talk to the physician and i'll come in and see your daughter and we'll talk about next steps from there do you have any questions that you'd like me to direct to him before that happens alright have a good one are you on any medications do you find that it's helping date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@@@ here you go uh nice meeting you @@@ there alright what brings you here today uh-huh yeah ummm you live in a house alright how long have you noticed this problem umm alright you've got diabetes hypertension uh reflux gout and diabetes that's about it alrighty um and uh the shakiness you came in specifically because of the shakiness is that right okay um now the shakiness you feel like it uh happens all the time or specific times that's probably separate what would guess would be the first you noticed that tremor did you think it'd be about a month year when six months yeah um @@@ or anything like that (laughter) uh any problems with numbness tingling headaches okay um any problems how are your blood sugars are they well controlled good do they ever get low that's pretty good but you don't ever notice if they're uh @@@ no problem but uh it's not like it's related to your blood sugars getting low okay okay and your blood sugars are usually what yeah uh and how about you usually take your blood sugar before breakfast @@@ range before breakfast okay uh-huh how about before dinner okay yeah um blood pressure a little bit on the high side you're very … do you have a blood pressure cuff at home or anything like that i'm gonna have you run it at home do you know what the numbers usually look like uh-huh they're usually kind of high you know what it's supposed to be yeah and even um you know for diabetics you have to change that because they found that it's even better to keep it below 130 you know normal blood pressure like a healthy young person is maybe like 120/80 uh so yeah we want to keep it below 130 even so we have to do something with that uh did you take all your medications this morning okay and uh are there any other problems uh-huh and uh let's see here any medical problems in your family @@@ uh-huh and any history of tremors in your family nope does it seem to affect any part of your body more your arms hands feet yeah okay we already talked gout@@@ alrighty well let's see if we can go over your most recent labs back in september you had uh blood sugars weren't that great you're hemoglobin a1c uh the last one we had was in august that one is 10.2% which uh is kind of high okay i'll no that's a lot worse than it was in 2008 it was like 7.9% in 2008 uh did you notice your blood sugars getting better since then or not really uh-huh yeah uh-huh she's in florida yeah okay alright yeah yeah how about problems with getting your medications is that ever a problem no okay and how much insulin are you taking now of the uh you're on 70/30 alright 80 units huh has anyone ever talked to you about trying a different regimen yeah yeah okay it's possible @@@ cause you know 70/30 is good for some things um if you have problems you know it's all in one so sometimes it's harder to adjust things more carefully if we need to i mean it sounded like you might have been sounds like you were better controlled before so maybe there is a way we can keep you on the same regimen uh and you never get you don't get low as you said huh yeah you ever adjust the insulin at all or hold it for you take regular meals and everything okay uh let's see sounds like you're so your afternoon and dinner ones are a little bit higher so we could probably go up a little bit on your uh let's see your morning dosage have you always taken the same amount in the morning that helps it'll help alrighty and you're staying here then right okay okay well good what kind of work do you have you been doing investigator uh that's helpful @@@ have you ever had any feet problems at all oh good did they do any clipping or anything good alright no ultrasound there do you have any problems with @@@ on your feet (doctor taking blood pressure) okay the number i got was a little bit better 140/60 yeah i think so um so you said you check it at home and it's high at home too i think yeah we'll look at that i think we still need to @@@ i think we don't have to check it every single day that's fine uh i think we'll go up on your blood pressure medication what you're on right now triamterene um hydrochlorothiazide and @@@ mmm oh down at the pharmacy right i think those are all maximum doses let me check have you been on other blood pressure medications in the past you are @@@ maximum dose i think it's 100 mg @@@ amlodipine have you ever been on something like metoprolol before no or atenolol no and any problems like lightheadedness or dizziness or anything like that @@@ alright as far as the tremor um you know it's most likely just a essential tremor what we call which is something that is not a big deal yeah that's a pretty small amount but use this hand to touch my finger @@@ touch your nose; now touch your nose finger nose finger nose this finger nose good um and uh you like @@@ screwing in light bulbs look right here and touch the hand okay alright um and basically you know it's not a huge deal does it bother you at all with your work or anything @@@ okay yeah what we can do is we can put you on a medication that's a propranolol and what that can do it's actually a blood pressure medication as well so it could help with your blood pressure at the same time as the tremors and sometimes it helps a little bit in regard to the tremors um you know there are different things that could the tremor would be just an essential tremor which happens to pretty much some of the population it's not really a big deal um are you a drinker or anything very rarely okay sometimes something werid causes the tremors but uh some other stuff but i don't think anything else is going on because you're pretty healthy um you know you could get you could get like parkinson's or something like that but you know that's a little bit differently yeah you don't need to be worried about it no it doesn't there is nothing about anything telling me that suggests that so i think we'll call it essential tremor basically but we'll try some of the propranolol and see if that helps with both your blood pressure and uh also the uh uh tremor okay continue all the other ones this will be in addition to those and uh have you had a colonoscopy before uh when was that good and did they find anything nope and did they tell you when to get another time you need a basic one that's something yeah it could be every ten years if it was normal so uh so you would be due for that um it's okay with going ahead with that at some point in the future yeah i'm sure it isn't um so i can uh so your due for your labs um did you eat anything yeah you probably ate something yeah okay monday so i'll order blood and we'll check a couple other like blood labs for the colonoscopy people and i'll put the consult in for the colonoscopy and they'll contact you to get it set up um there's no rush you can do that later yeah sure um uh did you have surgery on your shoulder before no okay um oh they did okay in florida right the florida va okay so the i'll put in a consult and they should be able to dig up the records from florida uh so they said that they want to do surgery they want to do a lot of stuff on you mmmm um sounds good uh would you like your medication um do you want to pick it up today or just have it mailed to you the new one for the tremor and the blood pressure yeah took a while uh address oh i don't know oh did she have a baby oh okay i'm not sure how much time she's taking off maybe you won't see her if not you can schedule an appointment with me uh but uh i think what we'll do is we'll have you come back in so you have those labs done on monday i'll call you with the results if i'm not sure what's gonna happen so in a day or so i'll call you @@@ call and then uh oh @@@ calling you back for that i'll take a look at @@@ and then we'll see you back in two months and you saw the ophthalmologist before oh you did you've done that um we're all set then you don't smoke good alright so nice seeing you so take that medication that medication can make you dizzy sometimes so just keep an eye and if that bothers you then we'll talk about that twice a day yeah we'll start you on a low dose on that one okay </doctor> <patient> um yeah hi i brought i brought my 8 year old daughter here um because i've noticed that she's been quite wheezy um for the past four five days and now she has a slight cough um sounds like she's a little short of breath so i just wanted to get things checked out um i noticed that she was wheezy um and it's it seemed like she was having some difficulty taking in deep breaths yeah she was playing tag with one of her cousins and she she was quite out of breath after no it's been fluctuating yeah it's just it would she would have these these uh episodes but it would resolve on its own and then she would you know go back to doing some sort of activity and then she would have all these symptoms all over again but when she rests um then it goes away so i wasn't really sure too sure what to think of it but now i think it's important to get it checked out so here we are no no yeah she looks fine otherwise no not that i've noticed uhm no no we didn't go anywhere because of covid yes uh not that i've noticed no no uh she had actually she had a couple of infections over the past two years uh they would come and go uh and we took her to the doctor each time and it just ended up being some sort of viral infection no uh yeah she's been yeah she's been on par with her peers um yes no yeah yeah yes she's fully up to date uh no she's otherwise pretty healthy no she was a vaginal delivery full term no complications no yep everything was fine no no uh she was how much was she i think she was about 8 kilos sorry 8 pounds 8 pounds uh no she's been pretty regular uh no she's been going pretty frequently and she's yeah no changes there uh no i haven't noticed any phlegm no uh yeah so she it's not like she turns blue or anything like that um she just slightly slightly has a hard time catching her breath yeah no um no well she has some seasonal allergies but nothing that she's been tested for sometimes she takes like reactine or like over the counter stuff but um no no prescribed medications no it's been across different settings but i will say it's worse when um when when there's colder weather yeah yeah um usually when she is out and about running around in the backyard with her friends um is when i've mostly noticed it yeah oh no uh at night so there was one one one night when she had some issues um with like wheeziness but it did resolve on its own just trouble falling asleep i think yeah no surgeries um no no medications uh yeah aside from that nothing no regular medications um yeah she's uh she's in grade 3 now uh yeah she lives with me and my husband um yep in a townhouse um so my husband is an ultrasound technician and i am a uh kindergarten teacher no uh no no we have carpets but they're new carpets we just got them uh maybe six months ago and nothing else no no yeah no thank you so much you too bye bye yeah i take abilify to help with my mood a little yeah ah that's me (laughter) good to meet you uh last time i talked to the pharmacist i mentioned to her that uh i have some shaking in my hands eating like vegetables or soup sometimes half the vegetables don't make it to my mouth and uh it's quite noticeable at times um that's why i can say it into my head like a plate and i put an empty coke can or something on it and it's moving yeah uh-huh oh it's been a while but i've never really paid attention to it until people start putting it out to me when they see the peas dropping off the fork or whatever that pretty much covers it all uh-huh no it's pretty much all the time now uh i notice it when i i don't have my @@@ when i'm holding even holding a fork eating or something and i was resting on this finger here and it's gone i know i have arthritis in these two fingers but i've got this started and i just take an aspirin for that i guess so i don't think they're related and i noticed recently that i had to throw a ball with one of my nephews and i have some kind of pain in here where i can't throw it overhand like a normal person would be i have to throw underhand i don't know if the two are related or not but yeah uh-huh uh six months what oh no @@@ no no that's all good a little short of breath but that's because of the weight more than anything else it was 119 this morning so that's pretty good for me yeah i wouldn't say if i it was 119 if it was 199 i would tell you yeah they fluctuate occasionally sure they do no no nothing like that cause i've had diabetes since '92 and uh never had that problem till recently well it was 119 this morning and they'll vary in the 140-150 range sometimes you know depending on when i take them right now i take it definitely in the morning after fasting and sometimes before dinner sometimes two hours after dinner @@@ well breakfast is usually in the in the maybe in the 130 and below and afterwards after dinner it's always higher than it is before dinner if i take two hours after dinner it could be maybe 180 170 before dinner it's down in the 140-50 range probably depending on if i had a snack or not then depending what that snack was hmm yes i do okay uh top number is in the 140 to 170 range usually supposed to be under 140 i believe yes i did hmmm my knee but i had my knee replaced last year and it never growed scar tissue on it so it's pretty much like it was uh my brother has diabetes but he takes care of himself and his medicines already been cut in half so goes to the gym four days a week and works out so he's in good shape mom's okay she's 83 still works a day a week so nothing nothing that i know of uh just this the hands it seems like no no circulations okay eyes are okay @@@ again it's all related i mean it depends on uh; right now i'm looking for a job i left florida came up here and i usually just do the opposite but uh my mom's up here and i figured she's getting on in age i need to be a little closer to her and uh i no she's up here i was in florida and uh came up closed my business came up here and uh job search is really frustrating so that might the stress might have something to do with it oh no uh 80 twice a day 70/30 as far as insulin or when i first started out i was on uh gosh back in the old 90s humulin or something like that but then i've been on 70/30 for quite a while i don't know if it would make a difference then no occasionally i'll get a low but that's so rare no no i just do what i'm supposed to i don't mess with it uh-huh uh-huh no they just raised it recently from 76 to 80 i haven't got exactly a blood test with the 80 though uh-huh i'm fixing to go back and get my degree i'm an investigator since '73 correct no i saw the podiatrist this morning yeah they did all that including the blood and the stuck me and no i'm only there cause just for diabetic @@@ no nothing at all just a little dryness across the soles so i always get a better reading with the manual than the other kind uh-huh i don't check it every day you know i check it when i feel i need it self medicating i know is not right uh-huh yeah we just went up on one in the last month we went up on the hctz from a half to one something like that roughly correct yeah good oh not in a long time since i've been on this for quite a while i can't even remember what i was on before doesn't sound familiar no nothing out of the ordinary you know occasionally a little bit here and there when i exert myself too much but nothing that i would really think is important to no not really uh but it is sometimes embarrassing in a restaurant uh-huh very rarely a glass of wine when i watch a ballgame or something yeah well that was in the back of my mind okay is that in lieu of the amlodipine @@@ okay yeah uh when i turned 50 ten years ago no well they never really said you know just consult with your physician well i'm sure you know if they think it's necessary it's not the most fun thing to do yeah yeah i did i have to yeah i'm due on monday; i'm ready for my labs okay okay uh-huh um down in florida they replaced my knee course so if there's a problem with it and it never worked out right but they also said i needed surgery on my shoulder here uh do i need to see @@@ for that just as a consult not that i necessarily want the surgery i'd like to have them look at it no no but they did the mri and the whole thing they gave me the choice of my knee or my shoulder right right down in uh tampa okay they said i needed surgery on both uh cause i had like four knee surgeries so they replaced my knee and they asked if i wanted my knee replaced or my shoulder done and i oh yeah i feel like the six million dollar man which is not a lot these days but uh the knee never worked right and it still doesn't because they never broke the scar tissue throughout the rehab they couldn't break it and uh i need i'd like to talk to them about that also uh i guess i'll just have it mailed to me that'd be fine as long as they got the right address they've been sending my mail down my prescriptions last time down to florida yeah right address okay oh good i'm glad how she doing yeah she did okay right okay okay sounds good right no no i never have same here thank you very much for your time is that something i take in the morning or twice a day okay okay thank you very

<doctor> hi there i was just hoping to ask you a few questions today but i was wondering if you could tell me what brought you in today i see ok when did the fever and cough start ok and has the fever and cough been present the whole time ok so has there been a period when she hasn't had a fever or a cough ok can you think of anything leading up to these symptoms ok uh have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same ok has she been sick like this before ok um have you has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever ok and anything you notice that's made the cough or fever worse over the last three or four days ok uh has she been having any other symptoms ok and when did the diarrhea start ok uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool what would you say say so i guess could you comment on the consistency and colour ok so you didn't think there was any blood in the stool ok as for the fever what was the maximum temperature that you noted and how did you check it ok uh did you notice any tugging or pulling at her ear ok uh how about any vomiting or regurgitation ok and notice any discharge from either eye how about any discharge from ears notice any rashes ok and how is she been in terms of mood or or behaviour ok would you say inconsolable at times ok and uh i know you said no vomiting but has she been coughing up any sputum ok um how much would you say uhm like a cup or more ok and did you notice any blood in it ok and with the cough have you noticed any difficulties breathing i see ok uh is she having troubles with drooling or your trouble speaking ok and does her voice sound normal to you ok um with the noticing the faster rate of breathing is the breathing noisy at all ok and do you notice any like retraction of the skin between her ribs when breathing like just so when she's breathing in and out is she generating a lot of force and effort to really kind of suck in and blow out so you can kind of see impressions over the ribs ok and and have you noticed any blueish discolouration around her lips or mouth ok and any urinary problems ok and how has she been sleeping the last few days ok any evidence of seizure or limb jerking no ok and and have you notice an her being like really lethargic at all ok and uh is she drinking yeah a lot more fluids or or a lot less how is she tolerating oral intake i see ok and uh how many wet diapers would you say in the last 24 hours ok and have you guys traveled anywhere recently ok so next just some questions about past medical history uh has she had any medical problems in the past ok and any prior surgeries any previous hospitalizations ok and throughout pregnancy were there any complications ok so no gestational diabetes or hypertension ok and uh were you sick at all at any point with infectious symptoms ok and um any allergies to medications ok and is she currently taking any medications ok and has she been around anybody sick recently ok and anybody in the family um have any similar symptoms right now i guess besides her brother ok and and in regards to birth birth history was it a vaginal delivery or c-section ok and uh are her immunizations up to date ok and um in regards to growth and development have you had any concerns ok and who is the primary caregiver for at home ok uh and could you tell me about her eating habits and typical appetite ok and when was her last checkup ok thank you hello so you are here for follow up today i will ask you some regular questions okay any pain in urination any fever or chills have you noticed any blood while urinating any blood in your urine does it taper off in the afternoon or night any leakage in the night do you apply a lot of force to urinate how about this stream is it good or less are you emptying well and what about the bowel movement don't worry i will look into it sdate of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ come on back how you doing good to see you what's new what's new you got a sore throat huh uh-huh okay backache okay what did they do when they saw you a what of what okay uh-huh does it help bilateral um do you have any sort of aching do you have aching in the morning on the side or in the middle now is this in the same place you have here because you had that surgery done about six years ago is it in the same spot let's see we had little well they checked your urine and that was fine you're having no problems urinating right and then no fever or chills now hold on one second so what you were just saying you had your colonoscopy when was that done two months uh-huh now you said that the back issues they started about a month ago so you get back pain on the side point to me show me where it is okay did you recently were you lifting things were you doing anything like that nothing new worse in the morning but it goes away by the end of the day so when you wake up how long does it last for so about an hour two hours how long yeah you have no problem specifically getting up no numbness or tingling in your legs or your hands and then no loss of bowel or bladder no weight loss nothing big no night sweats you said no fever or chills no nausea vomiting okay and then um right now you would have no problems turning walking um and then does the medication you're taking help now do you have any problems with your stomach um typically if this is just for arthritis um you know you have a history of lower back pain osteoporosis so this could just be degenerative but let me look at the films real quick if it's just that i would recommend probably anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen but you've never had any bleeds uh-huh um if you have then we can recommend another type but you've never had any stomach problems or you don't have any heart problems or kidney problems right yeah and you just have you have hypertension and gout uh high blood pressure okay you don't seem to have any of the other ones you're just on the simvastatin lisinopril folic acid um vitamin b12 the alendronate and the aspirin and calcium right take a look at the imaging spine and lumbar worsening compression deformity extensive degenerative changes with a lot of osteophytes okay well basically what that means is you have quite a bit of um quite a bit of degenerative changes my guess is those degenerative changes in which case the anti-inflammatory should work the best for you so ibuprofen how much ibuprofen have you been taking why not oh you're taking aleve that's it oh you can take uh take it in the morning when you wake up cause when you go to sleep it's just going to wear off in a few hours and when you wake up let's say if you're having problems in the morning then um then don't take any during the day you only take them when you have problems so i would say only take them when you notice that you have some problems there okay does that make sense right yeah i think so what i would say is when you get up maybe take them when you get up and then if you don't have any symptoms during the day then great uh-huh sure well yeah exactly in the morning um when you have the pain that's when you take the medicine in other words take the medicine when you have pain does that make sense okay let's see here let's see the last time so i actually saw you in june yeah no i was just trying to remember when the last time was that i saw you oh great and what else and you had just recently been diagnosed with diabetes no back then what's that well no we told you that you had recently high blood sugars right correct right well this one the idea is in your hemoglobin a1c was how we measure your potential diabetes your hemoglobin a1c was 5.9 which is really good let me look at the old one because let me just take a quick look at i think one of your labs was off and then we rechecked it and your hemoglobin a1c was 5.9 that's really good you're spilling some protein in your urine which was um let's go over this so that was fine your kidney function is doing okay and we checked your let's see we checked your cholesterol in november of 09 your total was 177 your hdl was 75 and your ldl yeah so your cholesterol looks really good see the sugars that we took were high but your hemoglobin a1c was okay so i think we won't basically we're just not going to start you on anything but you're kind of on the borderline of diabetes okay okay okay and then um we talked about the colonoscopy and you ended up getting it and the good news is you don't need to get any more what's that was it uh you had a little external hemorrhoids that's about it so diverticulosis okay and let's looks at your immunizations you should probably be up on your immunizations not yet unfortunately we’re still waiting for that darn flu shot now do you want the zoster vaccine remember we talked about it last time for when or if you were to get the shingles oh you did oh it was the pneumovax right okay oh no you need the zoster and you just got the pneumonia one you need the zoster one for the shingles when was that i really don't have it in here okay at least you think you got it exactly and you think you've gotten it huh i wonder why it doesn't show it you said you've already had one okay well did you have some back pain right there why is that you hadn't you did do no lifting or nothing like that but no weight loss okay and no night sweats and you're eating well you're eating well what's that maybe too much okay i'll take a listen to you um no you’re good what do you do for uh what did you do for a living oh that's right right oh i forgot about that good your blood pressure was a little better when i checked it than when the nurse checked it what's that right deep breaths in and out in and out in and out good where is the pain point to me where the pain is if i push in does it hurt point to me where it is now does that hurt no give me your hand you've never had any other signs of osteoarthritis okay squeeze but not too hard good lift up lift pull good when was the last time you saw an eye doctor how recently oh four months ago no ulcers on your feet ulcers on your feet now did they do they did something in 2002 but they did a colonoscopy in 2002 oh i see you had tubular adenoma that's why but did the colonoscopy in 2002 as well huh and 2010 yeah did they not take any biopsies this time okay okay yeah okay sir i'll be right back give me a few minutes yeah of course yes alright well the good news is you're doing great um i think really the only thing that we would need to do is obviously if you have worsening pain just let me know if you start having fevers night sweats chills weight loss worsening pain let me know i think this is all just degenerative changes in your spine you can take ibuprofen aleve is fine you can take that too that's not important yeah well the tylenol is not the same thing but uh ibuprofen are right well if it doesn't bother you very much then you don't have to but if you have problems well then take it um obviously if you have any worsening symptoms let us know uh all your labs are pretty much up-to-date we really don't need to do any labs until probably six seven months from now flu shot as soon as they come in they'll give you a mass mailing and you can come in to get it and then i don't think you need to see me for six months unless something pops up in which case you just call up and let me know and we'll see you earlier how does that sound you're welcome that was an easy easy solution nice to see you have a good evening did you bring anything okay (doctor talking with someone else) yeah absolutely </doctor> <patient> i am just calling about my daughter she's been sick over the last few days she has fever and a cough so they started around three to four days ago and around the same time she was also having like a runny nose uh yeah i would say they started around the same time and ah they have been going on for the last three and a half to four days uh no every time i've measured it she has had a fever and she's been coughing for the last few days hasn't really changed uh no she was she was fine just three to four days ago like before that she was her playful self no issues but yeah it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me i would say the fever has been getting a little bit worse over the last like especially today but the cough coughing is about the same as what it was when it first started three days ago she's she often gets sick like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick she also gets sick the last time she had like a similar cough was uh tylenol i gave her tylenol it did help her a little bit but then the fever came right back uhm say like a few hours later not anything that i know of her fevers been getting worse but i don't really know why that is um other than like yeah she had that runny nose when it first started and then she's also been having some diarrhea i think i would say it started around two days ago she's like every time i change her diaper she would have like 4-5 different diaper changes throughout the day and they they seem pretty liquid so i consistency i'd say it's pretty watery like diarrhea and colour i didn't really think there's any changes in in the colour no no no i didn't see any blood so i used we have just a regular non digital thermometer in her ear and her temperature today was around 103 degrees fahrenheit no no she doesn't seem to have any irritation there no she's been keeping food down no issues there uh no not that i've noticed no uh no i didn't not know like new rashes no oh she's been pretty like she's not herself over the last few days she's been crying a lot more just very irritable sometimes like yesterday like she i couldn't get her to stop crying yeah i would say uh this green slimy content yeah it's like green and slimy i would say probably like at least at least a couple spoonfuls at a time she would cough up no i didn't notice any blood at all uh i don't know if it's difficulty breathing but i have noticed sometimes she's like breathing faster than normal like taking a lot more breaths uh no i haven't noticed that yeah i think her note her voice hasn't really changed that much uh no like she's not wheezing or anything uh so like uhm like what do you mean by that uh no i i don't think i've noticed that no uh no uh no she's peeing fine she hasn't really been sleeping in between the crying and like just being so irritable i think she's just very uncomfortable when she's trying to get to sleep so uh no not that i've noticed uh she's not herself and she's still like pretty active like she's she just seems really unhappy and irritated but no she still has energy i would say i think she's more on the dryer side like she her mouth is very dry her lips are like all cracked and she it seems that she's drinking um yeah it's difficult to say i think i like yesterday changed four to five times they were all diarrhea so not really sure but maybe around 5 no no we've been here the only thing i could think of was after she was born she had to be given the light treatment for like jaundice but after that no other problems no no just the light treatment but other than that nothing no my pregnancy was completely normal no complications during the pregnancy uh no no everything came back clear all the tests were normal no allergies no just tried the tylenol but it didn't really seem to work just her big brother who goes to daycare was also like a bit sick with a cough and some runny nose for the last four days but uhm he didn't have a fever and he seemed to recover pretty fast but seems she may have caught it from him no just just her and her brother it was a normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks there were no problems after the delivery or before the delivery yeah uh all our immunizations are up to date uh no we've been getting her checked regularly it seems that she's been growing well and developing well primary caregiver right now i'm staying home with her and her brother goes to daycare so yeah it would be me uh so now like she is able to eat like everything like vegetables fruits breads and meat but over the last few days she has been just irritable with everything so even eating food has just not been great for the last few days so it was around one month ago and everything was fine then no concerns from the doctor yes very much sure nope neither of them nope i do leak especially when i'm changing my positions like from sitting to standing so i do feel there is some involuntary urination it's more like a urge i'm loading data in like every one hour in the morning especially when i take that lasix it tapers off in the afternoon and by the night i don't do not feel anything nope nope the stream is good it does feel like all is out in one go i do not have any kind of bowel issues i'm using my vaginal cream sometimes i feel difficulty in doing so because i feel that there is still something coming out from the vagina and i'm afraid that there might be a prolapse okay what's new i got a sore throat yeah overnight something that and i got a back ache every morning i was here a month ago and i had a different doctor you weren't available i guess so anyway uh the hardest part is in the morning when i get up it's above the back and it goes from both sides they took an x-ray x-ray of my hip and my back and uh at the time i told them i think that i had taken advil but it was aleve so he says to take one in the morning and one at night well i stopped doing that after a while and the last three four nights now i take one aleve in the evening you know at bedtime well uh well it appears to be a little bit but the hardest part during the day i can live with it it doesn't affect me during the day but the hardest part is getting up when i get up in the morning just out of bed it hurts it's the side and it's been on both sides it'll go from one side to the other yes i don't think so i thought that was on this is more on like now the last couple days it's on the right side and i did come in for the colonoscopy correct nope yes i did a month ago well maybe a little more a month ago i was seen here for the back so maybe two months i'm not positive but shortly after you arranged for it it started in july really 4th of july it's right in here it's not directly in the back nothing out of the ordinary during the day i'm fine it doesn't affect me uh till i get in gear i sit oh ten minutes maybe even less but it's just the idea of getting up sitting up and then and trying to get up because it hurts just getting up into a sitting position no except for the pain of the back inside the back or whatever you want to call it but it has seemed to alleviate a little bit no nope i don't believe so i may have lost two or three pounds nothing no correct no sir no no uh the hips are beginning to have a little pain in them when i start walking you know when i walk i mean i would walk without no problem and now my hips both of them are kind of sore it seems to have helped somewhat i was going to ask you which would you recommend aleve advil tylenol or which no bleeding no no i hope not not to my knowledge anyway uh-huh i haven't this aleve well i've taken it the last three to four days i've taken aleve one at night well but then during the day i don't have any problems so the only problem i have is when i get up like i say i don't have it without the pill in the morning i only take it at night thinking that in the morning it might be better okay alright sure well you told me you wanted to see me in three months and since then i came in for the colonoscopy and then i came in for because of my back pain problem i have if i have i haven't been told well the last time i came here you asked for a blood test and a urine test that was the last; i'm not taking anything for diabetes and you know you had me here taking the eye test i did that two or three times when i came in to that and they told me to come back in a year okay correct wonderful wonderful no it wasn't bad i mean the worst part is before is the flu shot in already what is that one for i took that i had that i did get that shot oh yeah yeah that i got i thought it was for the shingles i don't know at least a year ago if not longer because because i think you told me that uh if you do get it it shouldn't be as severe as i have gotten it i had one done not really it's just that's the way i get up now oh well old age i call it i don't know but there have in the past like when i came here a month ago to see the other docs i mean i had a hard time getting up it was really painful no and it's now like i said it has subsided considerably not to speak of yes maybe too much maybe too much right you want the shirt off or okay i worked at the lumber yard for 32 years and then i was the equipment man at the high school @@@ good for you i think next time i’ll go by you next time i’ll go by you it's right in here no it's more on the side but it's above the belt line it's right in through here no no like i said the only time it really hurts is when i uh get up in the morning not that i'm aware of when i was here uh it'd be four months ago now no what no yes i had it three this is the third time i had it done uh evidently not if they did the all i got is the letter stating that the colon is normal that's all i got and like you said the hemorrhoids were there can i put this back in thank you any particular brand would be recommended aleve isn’t ibuprofen that's better than advil or tylenol same thing oh well i personally i don't like to take anything like i say okay great okay thank you very much i hope so yeah alright doc i didn't bring anything i should get that sent to the house correct thank you sir time is 2:20 dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1238127

<doctor> so we're here to follow up on a few things i'd like to know how you're keeping up with your blood sugar checks have you been keeping a log do you have the log with you today great thank you and have you been watching your cholesterol intake since getting blood work done your labs show your cholesterol levels are a bit elevated i'd like for you to monitor your cholesterol and go in for another set of labs before our next visit yes you'll need to fast i'd recommend going in early in the morning before eating any breakfast and as for your sinusitis how have you been feeling since finishing your course of antibiotics date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ good how you doing do you have pain are you having pain it really hurts you huh okay has this been going on for a while yeah come in here and sit wherever you're comfortable i don't know if i've ever seen you before this may be the first time i've seen you do you want me to take your coat sir if the seat with the back is more comfortable you're welcome sit right here otherwise @@@ yeah no that's fine alright let me just pull up your chart here the doctor that was on this computer before locked it and now i have to restart it so i've been @@@ you today okay while that catches up with us how long has it been this bad how long yeah specialist okay who is seeing you is it a visiting doctor at home through the va here or somewhere else mobile doctor what was she giving you for the pain do you know was it vicodin yeah that's the reason usually we like to give people vicodin to try and get them over a hump people who have chronic back pain like that you're always gonna be in some degree of pain but i'm sure as you know if it's bad if it's bad enough you'll get something done so some people have pain all the time your body gets used to that right okay okay and really um i'm not a pain doctor i'm a general internist which means but i can get you to the pain doctor and i can try my best to get you on you know something else it might help cause i don’t have more experience with pain that she does um are you taking any other medications do you know what that's called is this the first time you've been here with us is this the first time you've been here to the va okay i'll check to see if it's @@@ then i can look and we can see all your meds and your vitals and how your blood pressure has been and all that kind of stuff um you said it's in the hip as well yeah okay does it ever reach the back of the foot does it ever reach the back of the foot okay it stops at the knees um any incontinence are you losing your bowel or your bladder with this losing your bowel or your bladder are you being incontinent with this pain i know this sounds like a strange question but the same nerves that supply down the back of the leg also supply your bladder and your bowels so if people are having a lot of compression on that nerve for some reason or the other sometimes they're not able to hold their bowels or bladder has that been a problem for you good any tingling on the inner thighs at all or just pain down the back oh yeah i'm sure it does i mean it sounds to me just um like textbook sciatica yeah uh i don't know about that yeah but you're probably still getting the pain huh let me pull this up i'm sorry for the delay i'm gonna pull up the internet too and i'm gonna show you something um cause has anybody ever done an mri of the back or explain to you why you get the pain in the hip as well has anybody ever talked to you about that aside from the wallet theory okay yeah yeah okay when did you first start having back trouble even as a young man okay yeah probably feel good yeah yeah let me call this nurse back if you could @@@ man they keep us so i'm most the doctors here we all work at either university of illinois or northwestern you know and they keep us so i was at work last night till about 10 p.m and admitted 28 patients yesterday so it's just gonna be you know it’s one thing after another u of i yeah yeah nothing wrong with that especially if you're a veteran use your benefits they're all gonna be free and if you’re not getting your medication here um you know right now we should definitely start because i'm sure it's gonna be i mean depending on what your co-pay is and stuff it's usually a lot cheaper than getting it on the outside okay alright so what they did it looks like that they gave you some x-rays they x-rayed the back spine and x-rayed the right hip and then the right femur which is this bone here okay yeah lab and all this stuff i understand i understand hmm yeah i saw that 10:44 so let me take a listen and then i want to show you this picture um so what the physical therapist was probably doing that helps is a lot of times strengthening those muscles are on the back groups helps you take some of the pressure off for the spine your spine is like legos like blocks and if you get trouble in that with the little nerves coming out you tent to get pain like you're having um so the physical therapy is good because it strengthens all the muscles around that and keeps those vertebrae from @@@ and putting pressure on um let me see if i can take a listen to you do you have heart problems heart troubles have you ever had a heart attack or okay mouth open deep breath in and out good good good okay can you show me with one hand where it hurts the most right on the side there huh okay did you ever wear a brace when you were a kid did they ever put you in a back brace when you were a child or anything like that yeah oh wow wow cause on the exam your spine is a little crooked it almost looks like a little scoliosis but not only are bent like this you’re bent a little bit this way and that's typical scoliosis usually we think of the spine going like this but in reality it can @@@ yeah i think having scoliosis and having an injury in the past makes you more likely to have this so scoot your butt back for me i just want to test your reflexes here of your foot alright and just relax do me a favor and take your hands and go like this perfect okay so the pain is on the side i don't want you to have pain of course but i'm glad it's not on the bone okay i'm gonna lay you back you can go real slow just lay back does that make the pain any better any worse can you relax for me @@@ okay so i'm gonna lift your lift your leg up here i want you to tell me if it causes you any pain and if so where alright we'll go real slow tell me if it's hurting you tell me when okay you alright where does it hurt right there alright okay the same here does it cause any pain when i pick this one up it hurts you on that side huh alright let me sit you up here alright is there anything that seems to make the pain better or worse does anything seem to make the pain better or worse position wise yeah like leaning forward leaning back anything like that okay okay uh-huh uh-huh yeah it takes some of the pressure off huh alright excuse me (doctor speaks to someone at the door) let me show you this picture so i think what's going on um pretty classic for something we call sciatica i just put in three x-ray of the back but i think i already know what i'm gonna find probably gonna see can you see right here i know it's kind of let's see if i can make this any bigger okay so that's much better so what i said oh alright so your pain you were telling me is kind of right here we're looking at the back of this gentleman right the pain is kind of right here so but these t's and these l's stand for are how medicine named the blocks that make up your lumbar spine what the picture is trying to show are all the nerves that come out in between those blocks the pictures of blocks here and a block there so from things like injuries like you got hit when you were five one thing scoliosis is another thing those are two things that tend to give people arthritis in the back okay and what happens when they get the arthritis so picture these kind of two blocks here there's a close-up picture and he and you live your life in your 30s you just came out no problem and you have no pain so these nerves travel everywhere some down your legs up your arms wherever and ever nerve is responsible for a different part of the body okay so the reason why i was asking you does your pain go past your knee does the pain reach your feet at sometimes is to figure out exactly what nerve might be responsible for causing you this pain so as we age you get these little bony spurs here and these little bony spurs pinch those nerves so the fact that you're getting pain here and the pain goes all the way down to your knees but doesn't get past the leg tells me your trouble is probably in the nerve l3-l4 actually probably most definitely in l3-l4 so what i bet we're gonna find in your x-rays we're gonna find some bony spurs compressing those nerves so what do we do to treat it is the big question there's a component of inflammation so you're always gonna have those spurs you can't get rid of them despite surgery despite anything so we got to get in the place where we're treating your pain on a daily basis did that help you at all the flexeril yeah yeah yeah they don't do it okay alright um the other thing of course is i want to see your x-rays even though i'm pretty sure i'm gonna see those bony spurs compressing the nerves i want to see if there’s anything else going on you've never had cancer right you haven't alright very good um so maybe let's start there @@@ but i think that’s a good way to do it and i like to show my patients just so they understand what's going on you know if i explain to you what's going on then we can work together to get you feeling better you know but like you told me no heart attacks or heart troubles surgeries you had the removed parts of the ulcer um you're taking the vicodin and then the blood pressure medications are you still smoking okay i think that's better of course than a pack you know but smoking and pain are related okay have you ever had a colonoscopy this has nothing to do with your back you did okay was it normal and when did you have that okay uh-huh a biopsy yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yes okay yeah yeah that there was a hole any stomach pain since no so no blood in the stool or dark tarry stools okay good so when did you have the operation to take the 10 years ago 5 years ago about five years are you allergic to anything so in terms of today what exactly do you think i could do for you today are you bad enough where you think you need vicodin are you bad enough where you think you need some vicodin norco is just like two vicodins now do you have liver troubles do you have hepatitis or liver cancer no hepatitis so you haven't really @@@ you can take as much as 4 grams of tylenol a day that’s quite a bit of tylenol right and a vicodin was 325 mg so in theory you could take probably about 12 vicodin before you start having liver trouble a lot of nurses don't understand that they think all vicodin and tylenol is bad for your liver it’s not um in terms of the norco they @@@ don't let us have norco here cause it's a stronger narcotic so i prefer to keep you on vicodin um at this point but the fact that you've only had this for two years i like the fact that you did some physical therapy i like the fact that you're still moving around i don't think there's anything wrong with your hip i don't think there's anything wrong with the back of your leg i think it's all coming from the back um any questions for me or anything i didn't ask you that you think might be important yeah i think you were probably having a muscle spasm secondary to this arthritis where i'm pressing right here i think it's yeah there is a little bulge but i don't know if it's due to the misalignment of the spine i don't know it's hard to say does it hurt when i press on it i think it's more just because your spine is misaligned but let's get that x-ray and see if we see anything okay um alright anything else any other questions or anything else bothering you okay let me just take a listen okay have you ever worn hearing aids no okay is it both ears one ear okay do you ever get ringing in the ear ringing in the ears no okay alright yeah i can definitely set you up with hearing tests you know there's different kinds sometimes there's a problem getting the sound from here to there and sometimes @@@ so we can do that any changes in your vision you wore @@@ yeah yeah okay i get it i know this i know you're here for your back i understand that but if it's all the same to you i have no problem referring you to ophtho to get glasses or to audiology to get your hearing tested any headaches okay any trouble swallowing changes um any nausea vomiting okay you told me no abdominal pain no bleeding from below are you moving your bowels okay no you shouldn't everybody's different as long as you feel okay and it works for you it’s fine if you ever do feel plugged up sometimes it's just as simple as staying real hydrated you know taking a walk um yeah yeah yeah i'm sure it is feel pretty good any trouble passing water okay how old are you okay um you know when you watch a baseball game how they have all those commercials about dribbling hesitancy frequent urinations all that stuff does that sound like you any man gets old enough his prostate gets old with him it gets bigger and it chokes off the urethra which connects the bladder to the outside how many times a night are you getting up to pee oh my goodness okay so this is the kind of thing that's completely up to you because there's really no harm in not treating it and i'm not trying to push a bunch of junk down your throat since this is the first time i meet you but they do make medicine for that no that’s different that's trouble with the kidneys you keep your blood pressure low you'll never have trouble with the kidneys your blood pressure was great today a little high but i can live with it yeah so um let me know let me know if you want that and we can do that for you that's really easy to take care of any problems aside from the back and the pain any other problems with your joints your hands look like yeah this really makes me wonder so did you ever injure the hands you've got significant arthritis in these hands oh yeah significant so sometimes so the fact that you have trouble here usually it means it's just kind of wear and tear arthritis over use arthritis sometimes more women than men we see a lot of swollen knee joints it's just sometimes @@@ upright @@@ yeah but this is i can tell you've had it for years because this is permanent enlargement this isn't active arthritis per say but the swelling and there's been a lot of damage for years okay do you take anything besides the vicodin at home do you ever try tylenol or tramadol or anything else yeah do much yeah yeah yeah yeah alright well i'll give you some um i think it's important to take scheduled tylenol i really do so taking it kind of every eight hours cause pain is the kind of thing if you don't stay ahead of it it will catch up to you you know so especially with a lot of these veterans who are trying to be tough you know they say oh i can take the pain when i can take the pain meds and they wait until it gets so bad and then they really have to play catch up so there's nothing wrong with you taking tylenol like three times a day staying ahead of it and that's gonna be your baseline cause you're always gonna have this pain i'm comfortable giving you some vicodin to take home take it when you need it i'm comfortable with giving you some muscle relaxants to take home take it before you go to bed if the pain is really bothering you but at least start taking something or something like acetaminophen or tylenol regularly because you've bled in your stomach i would avoid things like ibuprofen i would avoid naprosyn things in that family we call nsaids that's what name had is ulcers @@@ basketball players popping pain relievers and they'll give you ulcers and even if your ulcers weren't from that we just avoid them you know we don't want any trouble um i want to see an x-ray um just to make sure there's nothing going on again i don't really feel a mass i know what's she's talking about but again i think it's just because you're a little bit crooked back there so let's do an x-ray and make sure there's nothing um nothing concerning and just some basic blood work if that's alright just a blood count and a chemistry make sure your kidneys are working make sure you're not anemic anything like that have you been losing weight so you've been okay okay any other questions for me i know i know and i know that's a lot but usually the first time i see a patient i like to talk about everything so even though i know you were in here for trouble passing water decreased hearing we'll at least touch base okay i'll be back in just a minute so the way it works here this is @@@ big institution like i told we're northwestern or university of illinois i'm from u of i usually we gotta it’s modeled after the army so i'm like a lieutenant and i've got to report to the general you know and i don't know where she is she might be in the bathroom or something so i'm gonna sit here and put these orders in and be efficient and in about three minutes i'll go look for her again but i know you've been waiting for a while (doctor works on computer) now do you live here in chicago yeah uh-huh yeah is @@@ south is @@@ south oh okay i'll walk you out i'll walk you out do you like your medications to go to your house or do you want to pick them up now okay what i'm gonna do is give you let's see here um so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to put in a doctor’s order if you want to see the hearing people and if you want to see the eye doctor people and they can schedule you an appointment so this way you've got an order so you can do that after you're through here okay that's what i'm doing now uh then you'll stop at the lab and do some blood work and i'll walk you out and i'll show you where the x-ray is and then you can just get some x-rays to make sure there's nothing more going on um do you have a phone number i can reach you at so i can call you when your labs are okay okay and i can give you one of my cards too now how the heck do you get in the surgery @@@ are you far-sighted or near-sighted sounds like you were no it's the opposite so you couldn't see the board so you were near-sighted okay okay i gave you 100 tylenol with a couple refills so that should be good to start you with i also gave you 30 vicodin and again take those when you need them i'll give you my card

<doctor> how may i help you ok um and where uh so it's the pain is in your left knee where are you feeling this pain specifically is it at the front of the knee the sides or or the the back could you point to it ok ok and you said the pain started two months ago ok and so so has it been getting worse ok uh and when you get uh pain in the left knee how long does it typically last for ok so you have some stiffness in the morning ok and how long does it last for like 30 minutes 60 minutes or or longer yeah the the stiffness ok and how would you describe the pain um in terms of its character ok and is there anything that makes the pain worse and you feel it radiate anywhere else ok and how would you describe the severity of your pain on a scale of 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and 1 being kind of very minimal pain ok and have you had any injuries to your knee before no ok um and have you been having any uh any weight loss recently weight gain ok how much weight have you gained over the last uh several months ok have you had changes in your diet and or exercise ok um have you been having any fevers or chills ok how about any night sweats ok um have you had any changes to your vision or hearing ok have you had any changes to your uh sense of smell or sense of taste ok have you had a runny nose or or a sore throat have you had a cough or or any shortness of breath ok how about any uh wheezing alright any chest pain or heart palpitations alright have you had any lightheadedness or dizziness alright and any confusion or memory loss alright and have you had any changes in appetite like a loss of appetite alright uh have you had any nausea or vomiting how about any abdominal pain alright um and how about any urinary problems um any changes to your bowel habits like diarrhea or blood in the stool alright and have you had any rashes or skin changes or changes to your hair or nails ok and any other joint pains or have you or do you have any joint swelling ok so just a little bit of swelling in your left knee but no other joints ok um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before ok do you take any medications for any of those conditions ok and do you have any allergies to medications alright and uh have you had any surgeries in the past alright and um are your immunizations up to date alright uh and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently like like who you're living with and whereabouts ok um and are you working currently ok um do you drink alcohol ok so about 7 drinks per week ok and um do you smoke cigarettes alright how about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or uh or anything else alright um and is there any uh like musculoskeletal or like autoimmune conditions that run in the family ok um alright so that was everything i wanted to ask on history so next i just wanted to do a physical exam and just looking at the left knee are you seeing any um swelling or redness uh on the knee ok but are you seeing any redness ok and are there any temperature changes like does the knee feel hot or or warm ok and if you um press along the uh joint line do you feel any pain ok and how about pain over any of the muscles like the thigh muscles or the hamstrings or the calf muscles ok and then how about any pain over the patella or kneecap ok and are you able to bend your knee uh like like flex it straighten it ok um and uh and then how about walking are you um do you have an antalgic gait or or or a limp ok and any issues with moving your hip or your ankle ok um so i think that was everything i wanted to ask and check today did did you have any questions yeah certainly so it it sounds like um this could be most likely osteoarthritis um of the left knee which uh is something that would be best treated with uh trying to stay as active as you can but but also pacing your activities as well so that you're not um doing so much that the next day you're in significant amount of pain but it's important to remember that um activity will help um with keeping your knee mobile but also um actually help with reducing pain as well and then also uh you could use tylenol um as a medication for it i wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or nsaids on a long term basis although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain um and then also like topical agents such as um like voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on we can consider something like a steroid injection as well alright thank you okay oh yeah she has chronic afib and she is on coumadin not sure if she has stopped the medicine due to upcoming surgery alright date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ nice to meet you we'll go down here how are you doing today oh i know it really nice absolutely yeah oh okay uh yeah i know they're doing it occasionally with people so yeah

@@@ yeah yep they put a steroid in them so which medications are you taking right now yeah that'd be great okay do you need any refills on anything oh i'll have to check to see if they carry that here i don't think they do but i'll double check for you and you have refills enough for it and have you had the cholesterol checked recently your cholesterol yeah i think we should go ahead and check it just today um actually did you eat yet today you probably did right yeah yeah well unfortunately we have to check your cholesterol when you're fasting which means that you don't eat from midnight and then you get your lab work yeah that'd be great if you could do that absolutely so i'm gonna refill those test strips for you oh okay i'm gonna make sure you have enough refills so that way you don't have to worry about calling in for them so today i want to check your cholesterol and your hemoglobin a1c which checks your diabetes levels and then um let's see do you want the test strips mailed to you the test strips do you want them mailed to you okay uh did you get the flu shot this year okay @@@ thank you yes it helps having that around good and you had a tetanus shot is that right do you remember when approximately two months ago okay did you have any other questions so i'm just gonna order the lab work now and then whenever you come back in make sure you didn't eat the night before um yeah starting at midnight the night before you can't eat and then once you get the lab like in the morning and then once you get the lab you can eat yep oh i want you to come back and see me in six months yeah but you can get the lab work done whenever you're able to come back and get the lab work done and i'll look at it in the computer yeah just for the lab work yeah uh-huh you just go i have the order in so if you just go to the lab do you know where the lab is it's just across the hall here yes where they draw blood you just go there and say i need to get my blood drawn and they'll see the orders in the chart yep yeah uh-huh but within the next month that's for the cholesterol and the blood sugars yeah that's fine that's fine i'll give you a paper so you remember i'll be right back okay alright you have a little bit of a step down so this is a piece of paper it's just to tell you that we need to do lab work no no you don't have to that's for you to remember you can keep that with you and the ranexa we don't have on formulary here so the only way we can try to get it non-formulary is if you see one of the cardiologists and they okay it is that something you want to do okay and then um you come back to see me in six months yes that's it actually you need this to check out; you can keep it if you want to your blood pressure is a little bit higher than what it really is uh-huh 132/80 oh that's right around where you should be it should be 120s 130s you can take it you can keep it or you don't need it unless something's really yeah sure that sounds good yeah when you

little like tender um but now it's more painful i would say so slowly getting worse it usually hurts while i'm doing while i'm moving it or just after but if i if i rest the pain eventually goes away um but when i first wake up in the morning that joint feels stiff and then when i start using it using it more it's less stiff but it becomes painful i do the stiffness or pain uh the stiffness goes away in like yeah 15 to 30 minutes it feels it feels uh i guess most of the time it's like it's like a dull kind of pain but it can be sharp just with a lot of activity it gets worse no uhm i would give it maybe uh 7 no not that i can think of uh no weight gain over the past six months i'd say i've gained about 20 pounds um i guess i've been eating a little bit more um but no changes in exercise

<doctor> what brings you in today when did this start how bad is your shortness of breath ok has it gotten worse since yesterday or better or kind of been the same i see ok are you able to talk in full sentences or do you need to take a deep like stop to take a breath and the chest pain does it only occur when you take a deep breath or are there other times as well ok any other symptoms that you've had a fever or headache any cough is it a dry cough are you bringing something up ok any other flu like symptoms runny nose stuffy nose sore throat anything like that ok uhm and have you i guess i just invited more general questions about others potential symptoms do you feel like your heart is racing or do you feel like you have uhm do you have any belly pain or any changes in your bowel movements yeah ok uhm you said this started yesterday were you like completely fine the day before anything that's happened recently that's different or new what have you been doing these past two weeks in terms of sort of physical activity have you been moving around or no i i see and have you had any i guess any pain in your legs or swelling in your leg one or the other definitely have a look at that have you noticed that it's been bigger or more red or warm uh ok any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with do you have any bleeding disorders ok ok and do you take any medication ok alright and do you have any allergies and who do you do you currently live alone ok and do you have anyone sort of come in to help you out over these past two weeks are you getting any outside help from nurses etc or are your are your family members being supportive and helpful that's great that's great ok and you smoke at all for how long ok have you tried cutting it down at all ok and what about marijuana or recreational drugs and alcohol ok ok uhm and do you have any medical conditions that long run in the family ok ok uhm you haven't ever had one have you ok alright so i guess come to in terms of smoking you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past do you intend on trying again i know it can be very hard to to quit smoking ok if there's i'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that talking about your i guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or its outside the normal range is that something that you would like to cut down ok good good as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight that's great but also i'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that so given what you've told me so far it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much sometimes that causes the blood to kind of not move around your body is as as much as it usually does and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs and that can make it difficult for you to breathe so we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is given what you've told me so far but we do have to confirm it using a test also the fact that you smoke and your weight and your bmi is high increases your risk of developing a clot so i would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking and so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications like any blood thinning medications welcome they took some fluid out of your back remember we got the results back for that and it looks like it was clear then it turned bloody yes they did i see the orders for urine culture b m p c b c c r p and blood culture as well that is good but did that help you oh i am sorry i see that they gave you some antibiotics in e r date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ good how are you sir it's been a while sorry to keep you waiting oh sure no problem well thanks and i'm sorry but we had some add-ons today one of the other doctors had to cancel their clinic so it backed me up just a little bit let me get your chart over here how have you been good wow that's a lot but it's nice to have a job um cause you uh that's a lot of work for a retired yeah well you probably you know people that have things to do live longer alright so i saw you last february is that right alright and let's see what we did for you then good and you had your eyes checked every thing’s okay okay good alright and let's see here so you've had bypass surgery uh high blood pressure that's about it about right good good alright good deal when did you have your bypass how old were you did you have a heart attack good right you just told me that alright and your blood pressure is a little high today it looks like hmm and we have you taking four medications losartan yeah gemfibrozil okay you want them through the mail whatever you want i don't know it depends on how many people are down there whatever is most convenient for you oh i'm sorry to hear that that's good oh that's good how old is he that's early to have a heart attack yeah yeah alright let's see what we got for you so your cholesterol looks good um well that was a year ago so i may need to repeat that soon i don't think we need to today um you've probably eaten you've eaten today what i'll do is i'm going to order a fasting cholesterol test for you you can come back anytime to do it there's no rush okay your cholesterol looks great um and when you do come back and get the other lab i'm going to order as well this just checks on your kidney functions which we need to keep an eye on because of your blood pressure well i'll have you sit over there okay check your blood pressure there we'll try it we'll try it we'll be consistent then are you a bears fan yeah there you go if they can beat seattle right that's right lift up on the elbow a little bit there you go if you're flexed it'll make it seem higher okay that's better it says 130 yeah but at home though at home it's 150s you said that's a lot yeah it's probably not the best time to read it what time do you get up in the morning what time do you go to work could you take it before you leave for work i wouldn't do it the first time so do you have breakfast okay so get up have your banana and coffee whatever do you take coffee caffeine how early do you have that after getting up first thing or so why don't you get up in the morning um wash your face or whatever you do and then uh take your blood pressure and then have your coffee hang tight for me; um i'll be right back okay i don't think so i've already put the order in and i will send them down there um and when was your last colonoscopy do you know here do you smoke what about alcohol do you use alcohol uh-huh uh-huh okay and then let's see did they do the neck exam it's ent let's see here yeah and you saw the peripheral vascular surgeons and they wanted to see you in one year do you have an appointment with them let's see hmmm you're just supposed to follow up with the vascular surgeon within the next couple months okay yeah i think they're going to check to make sure they don't need to do anything because it was huh okay good deal almost done i just got to look up i got a new warning on gemfibrozil i want to make sure i don't miss something on that uh-huh okay i just want to make sure i get this warning here okay alright i'm going to have you get some labs in a month like we talked about uh and actually let me take a listen to your heart and lungs here yeah it's probably a good idea snow coming down at all today any snow coming down @@@ what bank do you work at oh sure you can leave that on that's fine okay uh-huh hmm can you breathe in deep breath for me good deep breath deep breath good do one more okay any pain in your abdomen at all any muscle pains or aches okay do you have any swelling are you swollen by the end of the day how's your fatigue and stress levels with uh all that work yeah yeah and you're not too stressed good hang tight for me and i'll be right back yeah you're fine alright i'm going to go up on one of your medications today i'm going to increase one of your medications the amlodipine yeah from 5 to 10 your pressures you know if they're in the 150s and i get only 130s today but we probably need yours lower given how the extensive disease you've had just to keep those pressures safer for you and then in a month when you come back um we'll check your blood pressures to see how it's going and we'll have you get those labs some fasting labs first and then we can see how you're cholesterol is doing and see how your kidney function is doing as well okay okay let me get those medications refilled for you i'm going to change that one okay okay you're all set see you in a month stop in sometime before that and get your blood drawn um yeah you can do it on the first floor yep i don't know their hours but if you come early enough um yeah and now you can just grab breakfast afterwards that way that way @@@ so um okay stay warm out there and um take this with you to check out just

remember we increased your neurontin or your gabapentin dose did you notice any improvement with that okay okay uh-huh okay and are you doing 800 in the morning and night with 400 in the afternoon how are you doing it that's okay okay so the gabapentin is 400 mg caps okay so how many are you taking in the morning and how many in the afternoon none and what about the evening okay so that's does it get you make you tired okay okay so those things have been working for you let's not fix it let's not fix something that isn't broken um okay and then i got to put in for you to see ortho now we could get some basic x-rays of your neck so they can see what the hardware is that you have in there where it is the location and all that um but we don't need to repeat the mris or anything i know they'll want it if it's too long ago to make sure nothing has happened in the interim um uh-huh i'm listening just so you know to order stuff and what not uh-huh oh yeah it really was yeah now the blood work we won't do until you see um endocrine it’s not due anyways and let me see what else let me see how you're doing on your refills i'll give you cyclobenzaprine so you've been using it oh it helped okay okay good uh your simvastatin expired so i'm going to renew that the insulin syringes do you use those still or no no okay well we'll just okay clean up your list what about adhesive remover liquid do you still use that you do use that okay so we'll not worry about it what about the nasal spray do you use that discontinue @@@ okay what about the claritin loratadine that's the antihistamine it's been over a year okay alright so you've got a good number of refills shoot what oh this here hmm yeah it's sometimes the skin for whatever reason it just didn't heal like back to normal the way it should be yeah yeah i wouldn't worry about it it sometimes you know with diabetes you get poor wound healing and then if it doesn't heal like it should @@@ yeah well if it were to like continue to be a problem then we'd have to you know okay uh uh oh yeah it's not like a red okay it doesn't have mercury does it okay so i remember once i had this blister on my thumb that would not heal and i went to italy i was there for six weeks and aunt goes oh let me just try this stuff and she puts this stuff on it and it like the blister healed right away right within a couple of days and so when i came back i was a teenager and i went to tell one of my friends who's a doctor and i'm like this stuff works miracles blah blah blah and she goes yeah uh the government pulled that off the market cause it's got high mercury content and i'm like oh for goodness sake yeah yeah yeah right yeah it's amazing it's amazing the stuff that that we used to use okay looks good huh okay it's better it's 130/60 that’s where you are supposed to be yeah yeah deep breaths okay just breathe regularly yes uh-huh the heart sounds you can hear the heart sounds go to various places on your chest yep uh-huh any swelling yeah your was getting an amputation so it's not the neuropathy but what it is is it's the neuropathy cause like you don't feel the way you should so you're more likely to get um to step on things get cuts whatever now when you get those sorts of cuts and what not then it's hard for the wound to heal and if the blood flow to the limbs is lessened which it can be with diabetes it just doesn't allow it to heal and it continues to fester and then it just gets worse and worse yeah right uh-huh podiatry okay it's just uh-huh you know as long as you're not walking around barefoot walking and stepping on you know rusty nails things like that as long as you are always keeping an eye on your feet and looking at them making sure that you don't break down you're fine yeah yeah right yes yeah make sure you're always wearing something okay let me um talk to my boss and we'll give you the green light to go you're doing there's nothing that we need to change today so that's good i know i'll be back hmm yeah the kidneys can cause hypertension too if the arteries if the see this here this is a normal artery going to the kidney and it's one of if it’s narrowed the kidneys are kind of also part of your how your blood pressure @@@ so if it’s narrowed it can cause hypertension yep but that's um that's not a very common cause yes uh-huh do you have e-mail i'll just give you my e-mail address don't worry yes sure uh-huh just ask me tell you about no there are cancers that are curable provided they're found early enough so it's all about screening and early detection so yeah so the problem is that a lot of cancers because we don't routinely check you know pancreatic cancer; there are certain types of cancers where you're a goner so essentially i don't care what yeah because the thing is that by the time it's found it's so advanced that it's infiltrated all the areas surrounding it uh-huh the pancreas cancer is one of those where yeah you're um it's uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i haven't heard of pancreas transplants they haven't done that yet i don't know i really don't know to be honest with you i'm sure they're looking into it but i've not heard of it so in terms of it being something that they're offering yeah i know it's amazing uh-huh i can't remember the name they've come a long ways yeah uh-huh so i'm not sure how long this e-mail's going to work but this will be the new e-mail starting july 1 the email yep well well i'm glad yeah great i'm glad um now i can tell you i'm still your doctor until june 23rd okay so if you need anything you call afterwards just e-mail call me i don't care okay seriously um and then otherwise we'll get you to a physician in either of these clinics if they can't then they'll put you in whoever is taking over for me okay if for whatever reason you don't like the new doctor you get just switch to a different doctor just fyi you’re not stuck okay just ask for a new doctor i don't that's the deal so we just that's the problem if you don't like who they gave that's why you make a request for a new physician okay well and i know you told me you can ask @@@ to follow you as well it's not a problem @@@ don't by fooled by the @@@ still if you don't like who you get just switch yeah yeah but i think what you need right now is to just do the @@@ yeah so i think that's the most important more important than neurology you're welcome you're welcome </doctor> <patient> yes i work as a secretary in a law firm no none of these how you doing it's been a while nice to see you i do what they tell me to i might @@@ @@@ you have them okay @@@ no um with you going that's all you're gonna do is cancer research you're not coming treatment okay okay well okay i guess i have to who do i get as a replacement don't know yet okay good real good yeah uh this whatever this is there's got to be a pinched nerve here everything is mimicking i guess that's the way to say it when i had the fusion done everything is mimicking that and now with that um uh i'm having these three and these three now driving especially okay will cause numbness if i lay on my stomach at night and usually i lay something like this i guess you know when i get on my back cause the numbness sets in now and i one thing that does help is the wristlets applying pressure um prescribed whatever they're called and they do help but it's not i don't feel that it's a complete cure um yeah they've taken a couple of mris and i don't know what the last mri yeah i don't know what the results of that was but i did something to where this muscle started in oh doc you could actually see a knot on the side of my neck it was that bad and if notice the time we were in the er well no i mean 3 o'clock in the morning we left michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning to come down here it was that bad um yeah we drove in; we left there at 1 o'clock to come in it was because it started it actually started to affect my swallowing i went to take my gabapentin and i couldn't hardly get it down it was but like i said you could see a knot on this side and one was starting on this side um the shot did help and the pills have helped but i think there's more to this than well that would be that could be one thing right there couldn't it narrowing of the canal and now on the mri can they tell how much it has narrowed or not yeah and maybe it's just the way whatever i'm doing or something causes okay yeah it has since like whenever or it was in november when it happened before and i came in and i had an appointment so i waited a day but i didn't have any appointments you know coming up soon until i had you so that's why we came in and again it worried me when i couldn't even hardly swallow i mean it took quite a bit to get the gabapentin down and that's when i said nope we gotta go in um that has helped; it's still sore right in here this muscle right here uh still sore um i'm having right there uh where it starts to hurt again and then again over here same spot that muscle right there down the side uh but as far as the severity of it no it's really decreased it at this point i would consider it maybe after we talked after i talked with them no but because of i can't get it not only affects has been affecting yeah and see what they have to say yeah i agree because again i didn't come running in here from michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning yeah it was serious it was bad uh oh boy no gosh i try not to miss my appointments real good in fact with you can tell the summertime or spring's here and the planting season and the farms because every morning i'm getting up and i can see the sugars are so far down um it's i have to wait for a little bit to be able to they're okay they're okay well some of them are down in the 70s okay alright uh there's been a couple of times uh during the day during the day i had a couple in the 30s 36 and 38 yeah i was i ate breakfast and then i worked it was like 2-3 in the afternoon before i ate anything again and i knew it the sugar was dropping so it was not the insulin is over it's just i wasn't doing my part right uh-huh uh-huh okay really i didn't know that it was yeah high kills you in the long run and the low kills you it can kill you in the short time okay then what i'll do is i'll just start carrying something i love the lifesaver wintergreen candies so i'll just carry some of that with me yeah and it's that's the only reason they have dropped is because of me not eating and you know you just don't want to quit uh just a little bit longer and of course a little bit longer turns into a couple of hours so yeah yes uh-huh yes uh-huh um the reason i run up the stairs so i found out maybe that wasn't that long after i ran up the stairs i always take the stairs i don't take the uh-huh uh-huh yes yes it does seem to it has made a difference yes um mainly when i when i really notice it is mainly at night that's when i guess it's cause you're relaxing and now the nerve endings are you're not thinking about it are you thinking about it now because throughout the day it doesn't seem to as though i need it but at night um you can that's when it and it has really helped okay i was doing one in the morning and then uh whatever it is four at night i'm sorry i yeah gabapentin one none four and that's again a lot of times that's the only way it seems and usually i take it about between 7 and 8 o'clock yeah uh-huh uh and then finally the hands and the feet stop and mainly it's the hands and feet uh a little once in a while in the legs but uh but then i'm able to sleep and i sleep all night yeah yeah that's what that seems to be working for me yeah okay okay uh-huh okay they may have x-rays of the neck it seems like i had some x-rays taken so long okay okay now in the wintertime it harder i know last time the sugars were up i try and this past winter was just i mean i didn't want to get outside to do nothing you know it just was hard and then my son-in-law i got to tell you what my son-in-law did here back in march uh no no it wasn't it was back in february we had that one snowfall um anyway i called him he called me once and yeah we had a freaking snowfall here and did some plowing and we got stuck he said yeah he says i know he said you know what i got stuck today also and i said you got stuck; they live in @@@ florida which is cape canaveral you got stuck he drives for waste management but down there waste management of part of the state and they get all state benefits yeah anyway i said,you got stuck he says yeah i got stuck in 75 degree weather today yeah now that the sun's going down it's only 60 and i got out okay that was when it was cold up here you know okay okay yeah that's the one yeah i almost forgot i don't remember it from the first time yeah he gave me a prescription here when i was in and that has helped yeah because it started in again and so um i they had told me that the pharmacy was open; the pharmacy wasn't open anyway so when we got home i found the old ones and i got my fault i did not know that they had come anyway so i started taking them again and then i got the other ones in the mail and sure enough it went back down again so it um did help it's helping yeah okay no uh huh the 30 and 31 syringes no yes uh-huh uh-huh yeah i still got enough right now unless it's uh i still got half a bottle one of those bottles like that about like that i still got about half a bottle cause sometimes these no uh uh no well that must be over because yeah yeah i'm going to say that must be old i wanted to ask you something i'll wait till you're done what is this that little break as it is right now and it'll open up i'll put some usually i put bag balm on them put a band-aid on them and it heals up in a day or two and that's the only spot and yet you can kind of see how bumped up it never goes down or anything always a bump as though it's healed is that and it's been like that for i can't tell you how long and so with working especially right now it seems to be okay for two or three months and then i'll be doing something and right now gloves going on and off constantly because you're hot cold and working out so okay okay and that was my main concern just because of the diabetes so uh but it always heals up um bag balm that kind of thing um @@@ do you know what it is whatever have you heard of it it's an old remedy that's one new one it's parabolic acid um i forgot what i was saying but it's actually you put that on something like this the reason i didn't because i was going to show you today uh within two days it'll get healed any sore no it's a um yellowish no no uh-huh uh-huh i'll tell you a story when i was oh 12 14 years old we were at my grandparents i won't tell you how it happened because i was stupid as a kid but i cut my bottom of my foot wide open my brother and i was playing on a tin roof and a nail was sticking up anyway i'm going we went in and my brother and i and i'm bawling my eyes out you know and my grandmother said to my mother and that's all i heard mary get the turpentine and i went blood-footed and all i went running but do you know i never had any infection they finally tackled me got me i thought it was going to burn and it was going to hurt it never hurt grandma soaked my foot in there and i didn't even know oh several minutes and then bandaged it with the turpentine and it healed; uh of course i always used to heal fast until the diabetes but i never had a scar or anything you can't find anything and it was it seemed to me even as a kid as bad as the cut was uh turpentine and it never burned i was baffled yes yes well it's the first time @@@ yeah usually i've got that talking one that i had for my brother before he died and whenever i take it so that's about what it runs question when you were on this side i know you listen to the heart but what are you listening to on this side oh really really i did not know that nope uh uh i have a question you were just saying that okay the neuropathy in the feet i don't like it's from the diabetes never gonna get better okay but there's time when it seems its worse and then times when it's better okay it's not the neuropathy that's gonna have them cut my uh we just had a friend here yeah right that's what happened a friend of ours just a month ago had some first it was just some toes and then they took her leg off up to her knee because she didn't listen actually a friend of name it was too late it was too late by that time uh well when she finally did and the only thing that i have with my feet is the nail on the second toe and there seems to be a tender spot under it they looked at it at um podiatry and didn't see anything um and i didn't know if that was just maybe maybe it's the toe maybe it's the neuropathy that i'm making it feel that way but as far as anything else and it just doc it scared me when it's right here yeah she checks them every night uh i won't even walk around the house i have a set up a pair of sandals that when i come in and take off my shoes or boots or whatever um on goes the sandals that way cause we have three little dogs two little lhasa apsos and a miniature schnauzer who i don't know why but they don't understand they have to put their toys away they get them out with no problem you ought to see these three but they will leave their toys right where daddy can step on them and and then i have a couple of times but it’s a good thing i've had my shoes or yeah yep okay okay okay great except you staying here i know i know i know alrighty hypertension and the kidney i didn't know hypertension affected the kidneys really uh-huh uh-huh oh okay sure hmm i thought the kidneys you know went along with the liver taking care of everything and sort of filtering and but yeah it makes sense it makes sense i mean if you've got something especially of the kidneys i mean they're a big thing with the blood yeah will you do me a favor well i don't know if you're allowed to but i hope you are allowed to take my number with you and yes okay oh yeah that'd be nice and i know you're gonna be busy so if i do e-mail you and you don't answer right away i understand i understand i think its well going into this cancer research is just can i ask a personal question when i mean personal it's about this cancer thing and i hate to say this and i know is this is this other cancers that are curable that they just don't want to yeah @@@ why can't if they can transplant a heart a kidney a liver everything why not a pancreas okay you know i had heard that and uh now it doesn't seem right but is that what it is but i thought like patrick swayze i thought that they had diagnosed his early what not early enough here and now it's gone wow wow okay somebody like me my pancreas is not working right i mean that's why i'm taking insulin why can't they do a transplant on me i've heard over there at mcb at the commission for the blind there's a girl there who is a diabetic who they did a cornea transplant on okay why i'm sure there's got to be yeah i can't imagine i don't know how like with a heart or a kidney i don't know how you would fit how do they sew that stuff together i mean who thinks this stuff up you know i just but i remember when what's his name bernard shaw the first heart transplant the name was bernard maybe that might have been the last name yeah that was… that was that was space age uh that was buck rogers and then some yeah uh and he didn't live all that long but it was still it was still uh okay this one okay what can i say but thank you you know you know where i was and you know where i've come and it's all because of you you've given me the incentive you have uh because there sure could have been a lot of other doctors that i could have got who would not have been you know i remember once we were talking and you helped me get the pump and helping me when i'm down well put @@@ and i'm i will i want to keep in contact you've been an inspiration to me okay okay you know it'll be @@@ @@@ @@@ then maybe @@@ time is 10:03 dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1249444 transaction # 578-10-2-316-0103 </patient>",True,1,True,1,True,True

"<doctor> what brings you all in today oh ok yeah for sure um ok so just to clarify he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days ok ok so let's focus on the cough today is friday ok um ok yeah sure so is this cough a productive cough or is it kind of a dry cough ok and he is he he's not bringing up any sputum or blood no ok good ok and does he sound wheezy at all to you ok how about short of breath ok yeah ok and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day like is it worse at night in the morning ok um and does it how does it sound does this sound like a barky cough does it sound um like harsh what is what would you say the quality of it of the sound of the cough is ok ok and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past ok and are his symptoms getting worse ok and um is he complaining of anything like chest pain or feeling like his heart's racing no ok does he have a sore throat ok and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids ok um and is he does he have a blocked nose or runny nose ok and does he have any issues with smell or taste ok how about vision or hearing ok and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats ok any changes in his hair nails or skin like rashes ok any changes in his bowel movements pardon ok no diarrhea no constipation no blood in the stool ok any nausea or vomiting ok any changes in his urine any dizziness or fainting spells ok any confusion or memory loss and is he an is he an otherwise healthy child ok so no past illnesses and i guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm ok and were things normal with your pregnancy with him ok ah and then how about as a newborn any complications after birth ok and then did he hit all his milestones up till now ok and does he have any allergies is he up to date with all his immunizations yeah ok and in terms of family history are there any lung conditions or heart conditions ok and um are there and who does he live with and where does he live ok and is she healthy ok an any concerns for old carpets mold asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in no ok um has he been around any sick contacts recently ok sure and has he traveled anywhere recently no ok ok well those are all the questions i had for you today were was there anything that i missed that you wanted to chat about today mhmm no go ahead right yeah ok so first thing is first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible and then if the swap comes back negative there is a chance for false negatives but also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays if his symptoms get worse so if he has a really high temperature if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak dizzy if he has any fainting spells please do take him to the er and uhm so for now i'll just wait for those covid swabs to come back how does that sound ok great yeah no worries uhm and i should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things alright sounds great have a good day okay so your blood report is back and the cardiac enzyme we were looking for are negative your blood urea nitrogen also known as b u n is within normal limits and hydrogen is stable creatinine is also within the normal range date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ i'm good how you doing just have a seat right there so what

village what hospital is that okay so is that where you're doing physical therapy yeah okay oh okay so is it colchicine yeah colchicine uh-huh i don’t know why @@@ hmm okay @@@ did they say you had gout so okay so you're on colchicine and how is your leg now you said that was 0.6 mg tablet yeah i just want to make sure it's the right medication though i think it is yeah it's called colcar it's actually the same thing as colchicine okay okay uh-huh okay yeah yeah yeah so vitamin d you’re taking what yeah and then the shot and do you okay do you have @@@ do you have like a lab value of your low vitamin d you need this vitamin d cause i would not have checked the vitamin d level before giving you this okay alright um do you get it from the va alright uh-huh @@@ did you call did i tell you they tell me so i have to put the order in i need to be the one to order it okay you know if you're @@@ and you're not having any symptoms right now i don't think @@@ cause i mean if you're having like active infection or if you're actually having pain then we'll get it @@@ okay alright so let's see alright so your vitamin d what level are you on how much @@@ uh-huh once a week okay @@@ alright and the other question is are you still taking allopurinol so that's good the atenolol okay are you taking hydrochlorothiazide hctz okay they only gave you one 90 days @@@ @@@ i don't know what happened there did it come by mail do you order by mail i'm sorry about that @@@ um and then let's see you get synthroid and you get @@@ do you need refills okay @@@ i know are you taking lisinopril and how much are you taking 20 mg right okay should we mail that uh the only other @@@ okay um and then you're taking the niacin and then you're taking the omeprazole do you have reflux like do you get heartburn do you actually have it do you feel that taking the omeprazole you get better or what okay um okay so are you taking the simvastatin or not the cholesterol medication so you’re not taking the simvastatin @@@ why did they bring it down so you were on 80 right so how much - were you taking 20 at home okay so you're still taking the simvastatin so you're taking 20 a day okay so we're going to go up on this cause your cholesterol level is high @@@ are still only taking half pills right um it shouldn't matter @@@ right so @@@ and @@@ medications @@@ okay so your simvastatin and on one pill so you um do you have any cardiovascular disease heart disease at all @@@ angiogram or anything before okay and you're not diabetic right okay um do you smoke you have high blood pressure right yeah but you're on medication for that alright uh-huh @@@ uh-huh @@@ did you get it before okay i don't know @@@ let me know if we'll go through it @@@ oh uh-huh okay so your hdl your good cholesterol has come down a little bit it’s 29 and it should be around 40 okay so it needs to be higher yeah and lipids should be going up cause we know it sounds weird @@@ this is the good one and it should go up okay so what i'm going to do for that is that you're on niacin right so you're taking niacin 500 mg we can do 1000 mg and see how you do okay okay and do you take aspirin before that okay good make sure you do that okay yeah but the bad went up to 110 but it's not like your goal should be less than 130 okay it is okay you know we also for everybody that has cholesterol it's @@@ go up on your medication it depends on the specific person so we have to go through you risk factors for developing coronary artery disease before i can change @@@ some of the medication but each patient's goal is different so i'm going to get @@@ refills now and then um what i'm going to do next is kind of adjust the medication accordingly okay it's kind of like difficult @@@ requiremens so you're 67 is that right yes okay so age @@@ the blood pressure matters @@@ cholesterol matters your hdl is 29 and you are on blood pressure you don't smoke right you don't have diabetes so i think i'll just keep it the way it is for now and see how you do we go up cause you were on 80 before right i would go up just a little bit to 40 and just keep you on that because i think we'd just have better control with the 40 okay @@@ niacin at all cause that's going to affect your hdl @@@ so we'll keep you on 40 @@@ we have that done let's see what else @@@ and we did your cholesterol already right so we talked about your weight which is great yeah and then we ought to so we kind of check the psa levels and the last one in february @@@ checking it right um so your psa is 1.37 um and in the past they were a little bit lower just so you know that doesn't mean anything in terms of its dangerous and all okay it just means that it's higher um and i just wanted to ask you do you have any symptoms at all like are you feeling like um do you feel like you have urination at all okay and is that bothersome to you no okay okay uh-huh okay if it gets worse we can always start you on medication if you’re willing to try it @@@ uh but it's been like two times at night if it gets worse @@@ @@@ urgency or hesitancy @@@ okay so just so you're aware of that and you were where did you serve did you serve in and were you involved with agent orange okay so did they ever do agent orange in the @@@ uh-huh okay and the other lab values all looks okay your creatinine level was a little high but you know your baseline when it's been like that do you have any problems urinating at all and you don't have diabetes right and you don't aches or anything with the statin cause that can happen with the statins @@@ and you're not diabetic right hmm and you were fasting when you had your labs right okay @@@ why don't you have a seat over here and i'll take a listen @@@ that's fine @@@ oh you didn’t okay well @@@ it's probably high because of it do you check it at home @@@ so 130/80 it should be in the 70s do you take your blood pressure medications every morning and today you didn’t what was the reason for that okay okay okay good take a deep breath again again again again again okay good any swelling in your legs or anywhere okay and then can you lay down any abdominal pain diarrhea or constipation that you've had which one so okay will you sit up for me now which knee was it is this where you usually get gout too oh really this is the where @@@ okay okay can i just so this was the surgery knee okay and no problems when they did this one okay alright yeah how long did they have you take the colchicine for it okay @@@ who is this doctor again where’s it at alexian brothers @@@ okay the the knees yeah @@@ yeah yeah so you came in earlier okay oh i'm glad @@@ weight yeah @@@ recommend it to all my patients so uh-huh okay alright so let's see your hemoglobin a1c level in july was a little elevated at 6.3 at 6.5 you're diagnosed with diabetes okay so you lost all this weight also from july to now and i wonder what your hemoglobin a1c was down so we'll probably get a repeat just to make sure @@@ um alright well i don't think you need anything you got your colonoscopy when was your last colonoscopy here no you got it @@@ @@@ was it normal @@@ okay and you also have diverticulosis you know that right in the colon it's outcropping of the colon um so you have your colon right and sometime little pouches come out of it @@@ okay usually it's supposed to be like this and so like @@@ through here sometimes it can get stuck in here and that can cause a lot of pain and so we have to make sure you're not constipated @@@ if you ever think you're constipated just take a stool softener like docusate but if you're not constipated you're okay @@@ okay good okay okay good okay so everything looks great okay um do you have @@@ in case something happened to you say you had uh say your heart stopped beating or you weren't breathing @@@ but it's just @@@ called advanced directive and @@@ um and then you a copy @@@ yeah definitely so we have to @@@ @@@ yeah a lot of this stuff @@@ so you lost 20 pounds so that's great yeah and @@@ hydrochlorothiazide 25 okay sounds good okay oh just wait right here i'm just going to talk to my attending so um so nothing @@@ cholesterol medicines right now @@@ yeah um and then you know we wanted to do some labs have you come back in three months and check on your diabetes so we can see what's going on you know um let's see so i don't think we're going to change anything um do you have like a dietician @@@ cause your diabetes @@@ keeps creeping up um i'm kind of worried about that um yeah but i think i'm more concerned @@@ the diabetes @@@ visit with a dietician cause you get to healthy okay @@@ okay so also i'd like to have you see the @@@ clinic and get your hemoglobin a1c level at that time okay um and @@@ medication or you need anything you can handle with a better diet and @@@ so um let me that @@@ and if still 6.5 it's okay @@@ bad yeah but if they can't you know @@@ just going to be higher that's okay we can always adjust your meds um alright i think that's it for now so i don't need to do anything let's see i think you're okay @@@ we don't even have the one @@@ day pill @@@ cause i don't think we need any other labs today um you can do it the same day also @@@ yeah if you're already here and if you're here you tell them you want them done beforehand no actually i can set it up i'll set it up right now so that way you can get the labs ahead of time so it's just like within three months so so like you know like you know @@@ set up in april @@@ may june july so in july right okay so you'll come back to the clinic in three months with labs now what else do i need to do for you or is that all yeah that's all i'm doing to do and you wanted to get the hiv test right @@@ um okay okay and they'll get that order downstairs and that's pretty much all we're going to do i'll go with you @@@ you keep losing weight okay yeah okay and you can have a seat over here @@@ and then you can go get labs done okay @@@ and you need to have a blood pressure done again i'm going to have you come back and see the nurse @@@ yeah you too @@@ i @@@ do about it yeah @@@ i think most of

home from school on wednesday he seemed fine but he i don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough it just seemed like a little dry cough but obviously i just wanted to keep him home keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick so he stayed at home on thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough um and then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired or sorry it's today today is friday um he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and i've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today what was it my thermometer says it was high i'm just like trying to remember it was it was it was like over 100 though 101 or something or maybe 100.1 but anyways it was so i i just thought i should probably bring him in 'cause i was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got covid and get school or something mhmm sorry it's been more like 3 three days like wednesday is when he came home and then and then today's friday so yeah sorry ah i think it's dry i haven't noticed him like spitting up anything umm yeah he yeah it's just been like little coughs no no no not that i've noticed um i don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also i think he's just been tired in general i think it kinda just there the whole day uh i just sounds kind of dry it's not like super loud i don't like he's had colds before but i haven't like i haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever which is different than you know having a regular cold i think so because yeah he first day he just seemed like little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever no i don't think so i don't think so i don't know if he's having trouble swallowing but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now maybe a bit of like a runny nose ah this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and i wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit i think those are fine no no i haven't noticed anything like that uh no i'm sorry no changes no no really been looking but i don't think so no just like fatigue no yeah absolutely he hasn't like decide to like vaccines he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever i mean he broke his arm once but that was it exactly like nothing yeah totally no no like everything was things really good yeah totally uhm no no i don't think so i mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine so it's hard to say but like nothing so far yep uh no everyone is really healthy he lives with me and my husband and he has a little sister like just in town here yeah i like she yeah she's healthy no not not like outside of school i like we know for sure not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say they haven't like contacted us about anything no i don't think so like i realized that i can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something but we do i guess need to have a covid test to go back to school even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure so yeah yeah like sorry go ahead so i just wanted to basically see if it was that and i mean he does receive you're so scared that's kind of what made me come in like it's scaring me a little bit yeah sounds good thank you ok yeah that's good to know you too thanks okay great! hello how are you today i'm good @@@ @@@ i did it last july @@@ yes yes yes i did that @@@ and it seems like @@@ yeah i think when i started there was a few but i even redid it just because i @@@ this is for the second round there's something that i missed the first time @@@ every tuesday stuff that you know but @@@ the @@@ portion yet just the noticing in and being brainwashed to eating less @@@ just the diet basically but not the physical part @@@ my daughter because even one of those things like do i have time to run back over here even though @@@ i say yeah yeah yeah i’ll get over here @@@ i know that but as soon as the wedding is over i can go back @@@ coming over here every day yeah yeah they told me about that but i need to have missing the other guys what their problems are @@@ i'm down to i went up the other day because the daughter had her shower over the weekend so i went back up to what i think yesterday i weighed 210 but two days before that i was @@@ 233 yep yep yep and it's staying off it's just like just eating smaller portions and not going to the restaurant and saying i got to eat this all and it's @@@ i know the portions on the plate i feel that the @@@ dressing put the food but the portions were big and it's just like you pay for that food i don't want to throw it away so you eat it and it's not @@@ and the wife and i both are trying to break the habit and @@@ that eating slower @@@ yeah she wanted to come today but you know it's been busy so it's like okay no problem but no i encourage people to do that the move program i @@@ myself has been @@@ i listen to some of these guys over there these obese guys over there and when they say 2000 calories a day and one guy says you mean i can have 2000 calories a meal and they say no it's 2000 for the whole day it was funny to listen to some of these guys how they can't quit smoking and how they can't quit this and you know when they talk about the portion size like and they're like there's no way i can survive on that and you can you can technically survive on that it's just that getting i think the body shrunk down a little bit oh yeah oh yeah another thing too uh i had surgery i had surgery december on the left knee elk grove village barrington orthopedics surgery that was an acl tear well to be honest we drove out to iowa for thanksgiving drove back was great got out of the truck was great went to sleep was great woke up the next morning and i couldn't walk i guess it tore in a couple of spots @@@ fantastic but there for a while i was getting problem except a @@@ fluid was building up and they went up and drained it the orthopedists drained it twice right uh i also @@@ went and ran a test on it so they recommend me to a pain therapist uh yeah alexian brothers right i finished physical therapy @@@ uh so they sent me to a pain @@@ building up the fluid and they are at 455 south roselle road i remember the pain specialist and they took the fluid out and they sent it out and found out it was very high in uric acid so they recommended pills for me @@@ 0.6 twice a day yeah them little purple pills yeah that was what was on the bottle yeah well that acid was so high and it was not leaving so the gout was there so fantastic never felt better yes yeah twice a day if @@@ can i get that prescription through the va it's a little purple pill okay okay so then after that went the only reason i went back was for them to take blood out check blood and i was very deficient on vitamin d so they started me on vitamin d 2000 per day and then once a week another one at 50,000 2000 per day and then once a week and i usually take it on friday 50,000 i don't think so they said even being out in the sun i would not get enough vitamin d to bring it down i don't have it with me here i can get it from them they did over there it was way down but i don't remember where it was it was very low if i can @@@ refills @@@ to do the blood work before the appointment so i did it on the 10th the only i asked them at that time about doing the urethra test the acid test and i got a copy of it yesterday and i didn't see it on there and i asked them because that's when they found out that that okay so talk to name the nurse she said oh no problem we'll have it put on there i still fast today so if you want to take more blood today you can for the vitamin d @@@ @@@ okay okay well whatever was in that pill; i don't think i always thought it was old age @@@ but i guess @@@ gout is and i feel ambitious you know it's like oh my god what's in that pill that makes me feel so good and i know it's an expensive pill and i didn't know if i could get that through the va or not the other joints they hurt a little bit but then it’s old age creeping in @@@ not a problem you know and they went back and says no they called up right away and said you could see the crystals in the urine right there like you have a very high @@@ @@@ i i'm taking 2000 every day and then once a week 50,000 on fridays i usually take the 50,000 pill once a week i don't know what the vitamin d does i have a feeling you know @@@ they're right @@@ yes yes yes yeah the thing is my doctor gave me a prescription and i'm almost out and the @@@ they only gave me one month they gave me 40 yeah it used to be 90 days yeah they changed it all to only one month huh yes yeah yeah yeah yep all of them need refills cause they're getting down yeah refill them all @@@ they send you all these bottles and @@@ difficult @@@ set it up to get a 90-day supply yes uh-huh yeah yeah like mine renew them all cause i think there's only like one that might be not yet but it's it's @@@ yes right since i been taking it i don't have heartburn yes @@@ okay maybe that was the one that @@@brought the dose down @@@ yeah i think i missed some refills for some reason i went to bed and i got back up and said did i take that medication or not @@@ that little bit let’s start you at 20 again well the new prescription is 20 yeah yes 20 okay yes yes i got that one because those were @@@ and i know they cut the dose down on that one i take those pills @@@ at night cause that's recommended to take at night bedtime for nighttime 9:00 i always take it before i go to bed it doesn't matter if you take it earlier in the day yeah yeah yeah yep @@@ recommended 1000

<doctor> what brings you in here today it just started this morning and uh did you wake up feeling short of breath or was it after you had woken up and we were doing activities ok and what were you doing before you had the shortness of breath ok and uhm can you describe the shortness of breath is it more so that you're having trouble deep breaths or are you taking shallow fast breaths how would you describe it ok and has this happened to you before ever no ok are you having any other symptoms like off sore throat chest pain anything like that so it's just the shortness of breath ok and so it it started this morning is it still continuing or is it uh ok is it worse at all than it was this morning ok are you getting any kind of chest discomfort or anything at all with breathing ok how have you having i've been having any chills or fever or anything like that ok any dizziness or fainting spells ok do you feel that your heart is racing at all ok and and have you tried anything that's helped you improve those symptoms like taking a rest or laying down flat anything like that ok have you traveled at all recently any uh contacted someone who's been sick recently ok ok so so when did you get out of the hospital two days ago ok and what were you in the hospital for ok and did you have a surgery for your hip ok so how long were you in the hospital for four days ok and in those four days what were they doing for you there ok and since or like when you went home today set up any kind of home care for you or anything like that ok and how about uh physiotherapy ok um and after you've been discharged have you been moving around at all or if you've been pretty immobilized ok have you noticed any kind of swelling in your legs at all no nothing like that have you previously had any kind of clots like a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism anything like that have you had any previous diagnosis of cancer leukaemia ok and are you still on any kind of treatment or do you see an oncologist or a mythologist not anymore ok um and so are you experiencing any kind of coughing up blood or anything like that no ok um do you feel any pain in your caps at all no ok alright other than that are you having any symptoms of nausea and vomiting at all ok any fevers or chills ok any night sweats or fatigue ok any diarrhea or constipation ok and besides the cancer any previous medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with ok any history of any clotting or clotting disorders at all ok do you take any medications currently ok any allergies to any medications ok um any family history of any lung or heart conditions ok and currently right now do you work at all banker ok uhm and what's your living situation like where do you live with anyone or inward where do you live ok and you smoke it all ok and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana ok and you drink alcohol ok alright so these are all this questions i had for you today we'll do a full physical examination next do you have any questions or concerns ok so yeah right now one of the main things we want to rule out especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs so we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot we'll we might do some imaging as well so yeah well we'll just start with that and then we'll go from there so you'll be in here for a few hours until we get all those things done and see if you need any admission at all to the hospital alright welcome take care tell me about your family medical history date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ how you doing doing well thank you have a seat right here how’ve you been good have a seat what's the matter with your foot okay so they @@@ yep @@@ a step unable to reach patient after three attempts they attempted to schedule you a podiatry appointment first call line busy second call line busy third call phone busy three different people unable to reach patient after three attempts last call on @@@ i don't know so i thought you saw the liver guy okay what about that stress test yeah so what can we do to make of this kind of stuff happen you know if we cannot get a hold of you okay i'll definitely schedule them again but if you don't hear from them you call me you call the nurse i'll get back in touch with you i promise if i can guarantee you @@@ yes but i'll give you the this clinic is all you need it's the clinic number here your direct patient cell phone number phone number phone number and if you call it’s my nurse a message and i will call you back you just say can you reorder a stress test or they haven't called me about the podiatrist and then we'll get that done okay okay this is the patient telephone number so you won't get me if you call this number i don't have an office that i sit around and answer phone calls okay you get the nurse who can put in a message for me and i'll call you back if something's wrong if you don't get your things scheduled or something's happened or i mean really we're having a problem here since you're needing the tests and you're not getting them for whatever reason so if there's a problem you call me with it and we'll deal with it instead of just not getting it or not hearing from them okay we got to make sure we the tests done okay i’m going to @@@ the stress test today not today i wish it could be today but we won't be able to get it done today you missed your eye appointment we'll get you an ophtho for you alright so you had recent labs in january when you got labs most recently now i'm going to put it in but you haven't proven too successful at this point well i don't know why they're not getting a hold of you do you have any ideas did you give them that number well i highly recommend it when you go to check out in the front you need to give them that number are you having the chest pain still okay you got to do me a favor my friend though you got to start showing up for your stuff you see me every time but i can't ever help you because you don't go for other stuff okay yeah i'll move it all of your stuff will be assigned to @@@ also i think so alright and the liver doctors can’t do anything for you until we get all this stuff figured out okay well you get to podiatry i can't help you i mean there's nothing i can do for your feet okay lotion is the best thing that's all i know they probably need to biopsy the skin okay and give you special shoes that doesn't cause blisters but i'll take a look at it they're not painful right they are take them off and let me see i'm going to take care of your feet i'm more worried about your heart and your liver working so you need to survive right we got to get you that stress test your blood pressure's too high still uh-huh and i'll check your vitals and we'll check it in a second are you taking your blood pressure medicine every single one of them do you know which ones you're taking which ones uh-huh metoprolol good good hydrochlorothiazide good @@@ okay that's fine okay have you ever tried the telebuddy system where they actually call you about your blood pressure every day and you submit it electronically would you like that you take your blood pressure at home with a certain machine that submits it electronically so we get the information because your blood pressure has been too high for over a year and a half now okay okay what is it running at home though okay well then i think it'd be good to have you have blood pressures at home then look at ours every single one that we have here i'm sure it is i'm a stressful person well see we've only got these here that’s why i think it'd good for you to have one of those telebuddy systems then we'd know what your blood pressure is at home cause you're right your blood pressure may be better at home but i can't know that until we check it at home and i find out the answer okay so let's try that alright alright you also need to be on a cholesterol medicine that we need to add today your cholesterol is too high your bad cholesterol we want for you less than 70 and yours is 134 we need to cut your cholesterol in half okay and for that reason i think you need to go on zocor or lipitor which is a cholesterol medicine alrighty you're african-american; you're almost 60 years old you have hypertension and diabetes so right there those are four what well hepatitis c is pretty much equivalent to diabetes in my mind it is diabetes okay you have four things okay that would put you at risk for heart attacks which will now give you five with high cholesterol so all of these things we need to treat we're trying to treat your blood pressure we can't change your race we change your age okay but we can change your cholesterol the cholesterol side effects the only kind of side effects is it might cause a little bit of muscle ache so it's the most prescribed pills in america is lipitor yeah that’s because it saves lives okay so we'll put you on a low dose and increase it as you need it that sound good i think it's important alright are you still taking the meloxicam good is that working for you okay i'd like to really get your i'm graduating you know soon and i'd like to get you all tuned up before i get rid of you i've been working at it my friend well no on you i'd like to feel a little bit better about you alright we're going to need to set up with this telebuddy system okay you need a stress test; we need the eye clinic and the foot clinic okay and then we

ribs at all on your back you haven't had any pain on your back middle back kind of close to your ribs have you ok and have you noticed any changes to the quality of the urine for example has it looked frothy or smelled bad understood have you noticed any visual changes in the area near the vagina like any lesions anything like that anything concerned for an sti that you're worried about understood

vomiting have you had any shortness of breath or chest pain any painful or burning urination do you have a history of any seizure disorder date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ how are

of the @@@ program you can leave it there it's no big deal i don't know what happens i don't know they're supposed to record our interactions to see what's going on we'll just leave it there cause i don't want to touch it cause i don't know what to do with it um so since i last saw you you had come back from puerto rico and you were having trouble finding housing and employment how is that stuff

losing any weight that will help that will definitely help yeah now it's at 225 yeah standing but you @@@ in june i don't know is this right in june of 2000 well you were 172 cause you were working here from alcohol is that why your weight was so low cause you weren't eating yeah look at how much your weight went up your weight went up from you were 172 and then you went up to 215 and then you kind of were stable so hopefully when you start working again your weight will come down yeah well that's fantastic so i'm very happy that so how long can you stay in cook manor for oh great so you have some time to get some money built up get an apartment two years do you mind if i take a look at you yeah let me take a peak i'm gonna wash my hands yeah yeah yeah i don't know how are your feet yeah yeah right okay fine well your blood pressure it's not for your blood pressure control your blood pressure's good oh yeah yeah so that can be due to the alcohol people that have alcohol they can go into withdrawals or when they're drinking can get heart rates that are fast and i know that you were drinking and not drinking and your body was probably did you used to get the shakes a lot okay you were clean when i saw you in november yeah you told me you told me you would drink a little bit in puerto rico that's why you left oh i knew don't worry @@@ its okay keep breathing well i was trying to figure out why you left puerto rico you came all the way up here just to see me i didn't think i was that important so i was trying to figure out why you came here and left your family and i

get in trouble you know you told me you were hanging out with the wrong guys and that your legs look good they look real good there's no swelling at all um so i think you're doing fantastic i'm very glad that uh you were able to get a job and you were able to get somewhere to live i applaud you for stopping alcohol and drugs i think that whatever you have to do to stay away from it do it i think that your health will get better as you start working more you will feel more motivated you'll have a real reason to get up in the morning and after a while you'll feel more empowered and you'll have

pain any nausea or vomiting have you had any diarrhea how about any urinary problems like pain or frequency have you had any skin changes or or rashes ok and how about any other like joint pains muscle aches alright have you ever had a a dvt before ok or yeah like a deep vein thrombosis or have you had a pulmonary embolism before ok have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok then was it a knee replacement you had done ok and do you take any medications for the blood pressure and diabetes ok have you needed like insulin for diabetes before ok and and do you take any other medications either prescribed or over the counter alright and do you have any allergies to medications ok and any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past besides the the knee surgery last week alright so you've been healthy otherwise i i'm not sure i i ask this i'm wondering if you had any fevers or chills ok and uh how about any night sweats alright and uhm has your weight been stable over the last several months or have you had any changes ok thank you just wanted to clarify a few things there and uhm currently can you tell me about where you're living and who you're living with

everything that i wanted to ask about on history today we'll do physical exam and i'll listen to your chest and have a look at your leg we'll also order some imaging studies with a ctpa it's called uh but before we go ahead with that was there anything else that that you wanted to add ok so we'll get the lab work started as well as the imaging ordered it will look for to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time it is a risk factor for it and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this so we'll wanna make sure to to do to investigate for a pulmonary embolism sounds good thank you any past medical history like any diabetes or high blood pressure or any heart disease how about any surgeries in the past hi how are you doing sir okay how can i help you what is it for what okay so what for oh okay do you still see a psychiatrist okay is this for work or something uh-huh uh-huh okay okay you're not working are you not now okay when was the last time you worked and you’re you're not working because what's the reason is it because of the schizophrenia you didn’t work or okay okay but are you on disability okay well what's the disability for is it for the schizophrenia okay and how does that affect your work why @@@ okay okay um when do you see your psychiatrist okay no that's fine it's not not taking care of things you don't have any complaints today though no belly pain no nothing okay that's good to hear yeah that's what i was looking at i think that's the one thing that you may be due for um and you're still taking the simvastatin aspirin the medication for your stomach ranitidine and niacin anything else any other meds clonazepam or clozaril okay and that's from your psychiatrist let me take a listen to you deep breath do you smoke how much pack a day any thoughts of quitting why not you know it's harmful for you right it's harmful to everybody it'll you don't feel anything and then all of a sudden it's it gets to the point where your lungs are too affected and you can't get in any oxygen people end up on oxygen at home end up on breathing machines because they can't breathe cause their lungs don't function as well it causes a lot of problems it causes heart problems people that smoke tend to have heart attacks a lot earlier than people that don't smoke um so and it is a lot of money it's getting more expensive so that's what i want you to do for the next time i see you i want you to think about quitting okay i mean i can't say no to that but my goal is to get you to quit okay so think about it and make a list of all the good and bad things about smoking um okay have you ever had a colonoscopy is your sight okay and can you see

<doctor> what brings you here today two months so did the two months of the difficulty breathing or the cough ok and is is this cough different at all ok and when did the shortness of breath start ok and is it getting worse ok are you bringing up any sputum at all with your cough ok and is is there any color to it or is it clear it's pink in color ok have you coughed up any blood at all sometimes little streaks of blood ok and have you ever coughed up any just without without it being in the sputum just onto a tissue or anything like that just coughing up any blood ok so an are your symptoms just constant over the last two months or do they come and go ok and is there anything that helps with your shortness of breath like taking a rest or any positions in particular ok and is it worse at all when you lay down no and do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air well i'm glad you came in today we can definitely try and help you with what's going on do you at all use any kind of medications to help you with your symptoms ok and what are you using the inhalers for copd ok and when were you diagnosed 15 years and do you know the how many puffers are you taking ok and do you have one that that you take when you when you absolutely need it has it been less effective at all recently have you been sick at all recently with fever chills like runny nose any cold like symptoms no nothing like that have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick yeah for sure any so this started two months ago are you having so you have not traveled then i'm assuming ok are you having any kind of dizziness or fainting spells no ok any kind of swelling in your legs or hands that you've notice ok any headaches at all ok any nausea or vomiting no any diarrhea or constipation no ok any fevers or chills recently when did you notice ok this was a month ago have you had it recently at all ok are you getting night sweats at all sometimes ok and are you getting any kind of significant weight loss no then your weight's been fine and so are you having do you feel like tired throughout the day or increased fatigue ok and how is there like how much do you walk or move around that you get short of breath or are you short of breath at rest as well and so you've been diagnosed with copd have you had to use oxygen at home at all no ok how about have you had any hospitalizations in the past for your copd a couple of hospitalizations oh i see and and did you have to use any oxygen in the hospital they never sent you home with any like oxygen tank or anything like that ok i see and have you when you in hospital did they give you antibiotics or when you went home did they tell you you had pneumonia at all at any point no ok ok any any changes or do you get any chest pain at all i see any any kind of sensation that your heart is racing no ok any kind of issues with your sleep or appetite ok any any exposure to any fumes or allergens in your household any animals pets ok and other than copd have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok do you have any allergies at all to medications or environmental allergies to cats ok do you have a cat no ok have you been around any cats recently no ok are you on any medications besides the puffers ok and so you use the ventolin and then what's the other puffer that you use do you know the color at all orange ok so you've had four hospitalizations in the past year any surgeries in the past ok and when was that ok do you have any family history of any lung conditions heart conditions any cancers ok and any lung cancers in the family no so currently do you work at all ok and what did you do before you retired ok and during your work were you ever exposed to any chemicals or any kind of in your ok and how long have you been smoking for ok and how much do you smoke on a on a daily basis ok have you at all tried to quit before yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better like even though you're 75 you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having like the shortness of breath and coughing so if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually we can talk about that more as well ok and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana do you drink no ok so yeah those are all the questions i have for you do you have any questions for me yeah so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted since you said the ventolin is not working for you we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you just in case i know you've been like isolating and everything but just in case i will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on and then from there we'll also get your blood work and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission ok and there you might i'm not 100% sure but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low have you have you been talked about that at all in the past hmm yeah and it might just sometimes just you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen anyways yeah we can talk about that we'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there great i'll be with you shortly hello ma'am how are you feeling today i'm sorry to hear that why do you feel that way date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@ @@@ right now say again oh alright yeah yeah that's actually they're doing research stuff oh no no that's fine alright yeah set your @@@ wherever yeah okay alright so let's see it's been a little while since i've seen you here at the va i'm looking to see and i think i see the last time was that must be way back the end of october november something like that well it's been a little while okay so why don't we go through some things you have got a few things that i know we need to talk about right away and go through make sure everything sounds right in terms of you're having your medications and make sure they're working and then we can go through other things as well um are there any medications you're out of right now okay got it what are you actually on right now how much just on the 20 mg once or twice a day okay well that helps me let me um as you're saying it cause i'm gonna just make sure that we have this taken care of actually you need okay let's make sure you're doing actually you're taking the 2 mg but you're actually taking this twice a day right the bumex alright let's make sure that uh okay you're out; you want to get it at the pharmacy today let's do that keep going you said that the losartan okay let's renew that one just get it at the window for you okay keep going @@@ give me a second; have to get a new list okay keep going taking that every day still okay so we'll check that okay keep going omeprazole sure yeah we'll refill that as well make sure that's taken care of keep going now i would imagine that's prescribed by the kidney doctors actually it looks like you've got plenty of refills on that one okay i'm looking for it on your list just a second okay got that done yeah docusate alright let’s make sure that's taken care of having any problems with constipation at all taking it okay that's fine renew it all you know i'm actually gonna start going through things and just refilling lots of other things as well you know i'm changing them as we go alright we'll get you more alcohol swabs let's see that's good hydralazine make sure you're good to go with that okay good how you doing on your insulin how much insulin are you actually taking now uh glargine the long-acting 70 units at night okay okay and then uh-huh with each meal okay how have your blood sugar levels been looking when you wake up in the morning what is it oh you have a log awesome let's see yeah let’s take a peek at it okay let's see i see so this is the time and that's the level okay in the 150s and 170s and 115 okay and you check it is this before you take your is this before you take your evening okay okay any times where you've gone you know like below 70 yes no i see a 67 one night there what's that before or after you started cutting back a little bit okay alright i see some ones in here that but you started cutting back i see okay yeah alright did anyone tell you to cut back good i actually think that's appropriate cause i don't want you you know when you're 60 70 that's a little too low that's worrisome were you shaking and feeling dizzy or okay yeah over the past week how have things been any day it doesn't look like you've been low alright is that the only time it's happened like that or is it is it if you find yourself with blood sugar levels that low that's pretty concerning um we might need to even go down a little bit more most of your other levels though seems like they're like 150s 170s and 110s it might be just a one isolated event okay alright well in those situations you might need to you know cut back a little cause what you're doing is essentially covering yourself with insulin absorb the sugar but if you suddenly don't have enough sugar uh as much sugar as you normally have then you're giving yourself too much insulin but if you think you're gonna you know not eat very much cut back a little bit uh but otherwise i mean on the whole these look pretty good uh yeah and you know do you know what your goals are for the morning okay i mean ideally you know below 130 120 in the morning but and so you can every few days you can go up about 2 units to try to get your with the long-acting to get yourself below there with the caveat that if you're getting those low levels those 60s you know below 70s even in the 60s or lower something like that then you've got to be more liberal and you have to give yourself a much bigger range let yourself go higher cause the going too low that's more worrisome than having higher slightly higher okay oh well let's try to get you a new it's the glucometer reading yeah i can certainly do that for you cause we definitely need to have good readings for you under below 130/80 uh-huh well not quite yeah okay well 130/80 that's what you want uh between 60 and 90 between 60 and 100 you doing your long-acting in the morning or at night good okay have you always done it in the morning alright yeah that's probably best for you so that you don't bottom out at night alright i definitely agree with that that's sounds just right exactly yeah alright i think i've got most of your medicines up-to-date now so we're getting them in there okay okay okay you're still taking nifedipine right okay just wanted to make sure do you have enough of those lancets alright yeah actually let me put in an order right now to get the glucometer sure sure good alright so let's go through some other things here so it looks like diabetes i think we've tackled that pretty well uh got the things you need the supplies are gonna be for you at the pharmacy uh-huh uh-huh yep i went through the whole kind of list here i just one by one make sure that we have refills uh-huh yep you're good to go on that too so let's see here what i see so we talked about diabetes your kidney disease uh you have a fistula in place is that right not working now okay okay okay okay okay good sure okay alright wait and see okay uh-huh uh-huh sure happening again controlling your diabetes uh-huh that's why we'll have you keep your diabetes under control uh-huh exactly you answered your own question uh-huh right good your blood pressures you been checking that at home what have they been looking like that's good that's right at goal for you and even the ones we have for you right now great you're doing very well okay had you taken your meds yet you’d be surprised what your medicines can do for you and here now it looks great okay okay better once you take the medicines okay alright and it looks like your i'm pleased with that with regards to your cholesterol i want to take a look at your most recent levels let's see what we've got most recently in october @@@@ which was okay about six months ago and you are you're cholesterol levels are looking good they're at goal okay uh let's see now you've had some heart problems before yeah any problems with chest pain at all when how far okay so you're feeling like you're not getting enough air right is it that you feel a pain here or just not enough air okay okay sit down and you feel better ever when you're sitting down like you are right now that you have pain here so is it like pressure or okay okay alright any swelling in your legs okay now you're taking this twice a day @@@ you have a little bit down here let me see your legs for a minute okay alright any problems lying flat and getting enough air okay waking up in the middle of the night okay alright does your heart go bump bump bump beating through your chest you know the terminology okay okay do you feel like it's the distance you've been able to walk has gotten any worse recently over what period of time okay how far could you walk at christmas okay okay a couple of things the kidney doctor saw you in february okay did they do anything different okay in their note they say you're taking the bumex daily you're taking it twice a day though maybe they just didn't know okay swelling okay and you had a stress test in january yeah okay yeah let me look through that let me take a look at it here i'm trying to find your stress test here i don't see it either oh no i believe you i see it's been done but i can't see it here i see that it's been done but i don't see the report uh january @@ @@@@ alright uh he is a transplant kidney physician he doesn't actually do the surgery uh he actually probably won't even be in the room he will take care of you before and after but not as much during the actual surgery that's for the surgeons to take care of that that’s @@@ okay okay put that order in right now okay do you normally follow with the heart doctors with the heart doctors do you check with the cardiologists the heart doctors have you seen them in the clinic lately you just haven't seen them after that's what i was asking okay i think they might need to have you see them i'm gonna have you hop up on the chair i want to do a few more things are following with the eye doctors as well okay things going okay from that standpoint uh-huh okay what do they intend on doing right just take some deep breaths in and out good deep breath keep going sounds very clear good okay breathe normally do you feel any nausea vomiting not feeling dizzy go away any bloody stool or anything like that go ahead and lay back here follow with the foot doctors as well alright give me a couple of seconds i need to step out for a moment take care of some things for you alright back in a second good to see you did they get all the information in the past ultrasound colonoscopy; they asked me to fax it over you got a copy okay alright and i did fax it to them yeah are you being followed with cardiologists here or at u.i.c okay but i want you to at least have a follow-up appointment with cardiology we found that the actual report was hidden of your stress test it was normal which is a good thing so more than likely you know you're heart's having you know like problems getting enough you know like oxygen so that’s good probably your exercise tolerance is a little bit down but it uh you're not having like a heart attack uh so that's good we'll make it; we'll make an appointment with cardiology all your stuff will be waiting for you at the pharmacy and then we'll go from there i'll see you back in about three months alright alright sir alright alright we'll have you take this and you can make the follow-up appointment alright you're welcome take care alright </doctor> <patient> hi i am having difficulties breathing and i've just had this cough and it's it's been two months now two months of difficulty breathing and the cough is gotten worse i've had a cough for a couple years now i'm a smoker it's just it just doesn't go away about two months ago oh yeah uhm i sometimes uhm yeah i do it's pink in color hmm sometimes streaks of blood here and there no shortness of breath just kind of stays yeah sometimes resting does help i find that it's worse when i'm moving around i'm huffing and puffing more no no it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing i won't be surprised if i can't even sleep it's been quite difficult i i don't even know why i waited so long i should have come in earlier i've just been using my inhalers a bit more but they don't always help oh i have copd it's been 15 years now uhm i'm taking uhm i'm taking two puffers yeah yeah i do that's the one that i've been trying to use but yeah it hasn't been helping the blue one i tried to keep taking the blue one and it's just you know it's not helping no oh no i've been staying at home i've been very careful these days no oh no no no no no well sometimes i do but it's not been severe it's been there for the past uhm always when i'm stressed out i get these headaches it's nothing new no no i have a mild fever it just it's been there uhm i was just checking my temperature about a month ago and noticed that i had a fever yeah i haven't checked it recently but i do feel a little hot sometimes no it's been the same although i have been eating quite a lot more now with the pandemic and being home you know that might be still in the same oh my god so tired i can you know with the difficulty breathing i feel like all my energy spent just trying to trying to get to the bathroom uhm i'm short of breath all the time yeah it's just it's it's worse when i am moving no yeah i had a had a couple last year yeah yeah about four hospitalizations last year yeah yeah i did i did although they told me my copd was pretty bad that i might need to get oxygen at some point yeah yeah they did they did i don't think so uhm sometimes when i breathe in very deep no umm well no not really it's just the difficulty breathing sometimes it's been hard to sleep no no i'm pretty healthy otherwise i'm allergic to cats no nope nope uhm i don't remember the name it's orange i had a knee replacement on my right side 10 years ago my dad had copd as well no i'm retired i was i was a mechanic at chrysler's not that i'm aware of oh yeah i was a teenager when i started i smoke i smoke a pack a day i can't quit it's not gonna happen a lot of people

other copd exacerbations i'm thinking this is exactly that and i'll have to stay in the hospital right for a couple of days sure yeah they talked about it last time i've been trying to avoid it but if it has to happen it has to happen sure i'm sad and depressed my cancer came back right back here now before we get starated you're being recorded you're being recorded they said you agreed to it okay i don't want to do anything illegal it's in my jacket here that's the device yeah been that long ago okay uh yes there are let's see i tried to get the va refills all the refills by the doctor for the prescription crap oh so i'm just about out of everything especially the water pills one doctor will tell me to take two pills and then another doctor will tell me to take four pills and you give me a

and one at night they been looking i'm pretty good but like i said oh okay @@@ uh this is this week right yeah yeah just before i eat and take the insulin oh yes no 41 oh they told me before when they first put me on it that if it should start dropping uh-huh uh well it starts in the leg area and they start tingling and then it goes up into the lips and then once it gets in there then my eyes just seem to blur up the left eye and when that happens i know what's happening something's going wrong uh this past uh sunday i didn't mark it down but sunday morning it dropped down to 42 at about 3 o'clock in the morning i woke up used the washroom and i was feeling kind of funny so i decided to take it you know when i took it it was 42 it was 42 and uh i took some orange juice drank some orange juice which was sunny d and brought it back up uh this week yeah uh-huh yeah well these uh perhaps when i had a light dinner and uh just what i did i had just maybe just eaten a sandwich @@@ yeah right uh-huh yeah uh off hand i don’t because they’ve been fluctuating so much it's fluctuating so much oh okay uh-huh yeah so i think uh i think that i'm actually gonna need a new actually get myself a new meter this one is not very accurate i don't know i tried calibrating it and everything but it still goes up and down so i don't get very good readings right yeah uh-huh what should be an ideal blood pressure so 130 over 80 okay i’ve been under the impression it should be below 139 and 80 @@@ i had @@@ tell me my reading should be 130 over 80 @@@ and the heartrate should be uh in the morning yeah right uh-huh right that's taking more away from if it's gonna spike it's gonna spike during the daytime when i'm awake that 285 scared me last month but i know what that was from yeah yeah i needed that it's the one thing i do have is @@@ uh yeah and some rubber gloves latex gloves uh-huh okay i'll did you redo the prostate medicine tamsulosin tamsulosin okay the ibuprofen @@@ okay great

the kidney transplant doctor over at u of i it's the actual transplant surgeon would be the actual i got to talk to him alone with the donor because we’re different blood types and oh what else basically wait and see whether or not we're compatible and i've got four others that are waiting in the wings one thing i'm not clear of with this transplant once you've had a transplant the diabetes is the cause of the kidney going bad in the first place what's gonna prevent this from doing the same with the transplant controlling it things like diet and losing weight and all of that okay i mean i wasn't sure about that you know they say you get a new kidney and a new person that doesn't seem to be with the that's the first thing that's the thing that caused it in the first place now i understand now i know yeah let's see 115/78 they it got up a little high this morning; well actually it was 142 over at home 50 uh no yeah it was 169/80 this morning with a 69 heart rate yeah @@@ @@@

then i'll just get tired or i can be coming out of the basement up the stairs if i go down and put some clothes in the washer or something and if i'm coming up the stairs i'll get out of breath and have to kind of cool myself right uh-huh just no it seems like a tightness it's not enough air cause i'm gasping for breath and uh sit down and feel better after a while uh the nose cavities dry out

only to go to the washroom i have to wake up to pee @@@ no yeah uh past a couple of months say from christmas time to now it's gotten on a scale of 1-10 i'd say it's gotten about 3% worse oh i could

<doctor> and who are we seeing today well hello young man how are you feeling today for how long now no i mean when did he start complaining of stomach pain oh okay let me check him did he have any nausea or vomiting and then he is complaining of tummy pain well the good part is he is not dehydrated any diarrhea hm but no blood or anything in the stools or vomit okay good well let me run some tests but the signs and symptoms sound like he might have a stomach flu also called as gastroenteritis in medical terms i will start him on some medicines and hopefully that should help date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ good how are you we're going right in here good you got your blood sugar readings offhand @@@ let's see what you got what's that sure yeah yeah they run where in the mornings when you wake up well why is that @@@ but you were doing a little bit better from what i remember what do you think has happened why are you not doing as well right now so they were doing alright so they were doing um the last time i saw you was about a month ago and they switched you to glargine 20 and aspart 15 twice a day and now what are you at okay hold on one second okay it looks like your last a1c was 05/24/10 okay so repeat your insulin levels your insulin regimen again glargine 20 and then how much are you having with your insulin the aspart the short-acting 24 of the aspart of the short-acting that you take with meals do you have a follow-up with her or him or just me okay this is pharmacy note says okay when did they tell you to increase your okay cause they didn’t write that in the notes and who was the pharmacist that you see name okay oh and you have a podiatry follow-up coming up tomorrow okay alright so you were just switched on the 30th you said that the glargine 20 and aspart 24 15 and 24 on the 30th okay so then you take glargine what time during the day when you get up in the morning you take the long-acting insulin when you get up do know what the glargine is when i say glargine what do you think is it long-acting or short-acting okay what does your bottle say the long-acting okay okay okay alright and when you get up in the morning you said your blood sugar is in the 200s what do you mean fruity water is it like kool-aid did you buy it in the store so you did the glargine in the morning what is your blood sugar after you take the what is it do you check it at lunch do you check it at dinner what did you what does it go down to 130 before you eat lunch after you eat lunch what is it before you eat lunch and you don't take any insulin with lunch correct you take the short-acting when you get up when do you take the glargine then when do you take the long-acting at bedtime okay so you take the long-acting at bedtime you get up its like 284 and that's without eating and then you take the 24 units now in the morning before you eat how long before you eat do you do it okay and then for lunch you said you check it before lunch usually okay okay and what has it been running before dinner since they changed you to 24 right around 2 how about after dinner after you @@@ then you take your insulin before dinner short-act okay and then do you measure it ever after dinner after you take your short-acting okay but you don't know what it is okay you need to write it down for me okay they didn't check your blood sugar today did they i’m going to see if we can check your blood sugar real quick i think we need to recheck your a1c as well well i'm sure it is okay you seem to know that the question is can we increase your glargine the nighttime insulin a little bit uh oh an egg taste in your mouth okay are you not taking it at all how many times a week do you miss your glargine okay well how many times have you missed it i know you try okay okay okay let's get you a glucose monitor alright let me just check your blood sugar alright you want to do it @@@ one of these @@@ finger there there you go yeah that's it not bad that's good; i mean it should be when you wake up in the morning that's what we now if you take your glargine at night when you wake up in the morning it needs to kind of 120 or under now what did you eat today what have you eaten today what time did you @@@ before that okay so it's about 4 o'clock now okay so it's just four hours post prandially so it still might be a little bit high um maybe what we can do is we can check your a1c if your a1c is really high uh then maybe i could give you a call and i could tell you to just increase your glargine alright um but if it's fine then we can keep it as is okay we just made a change recently so you said it's still high your morning blood sugars are still high right okay those are great before the change you said since the change your sugars have been higher yeah oh right my suspicion but the 70/30 before you were taking your blood sugar you thought your blood sugar was more controlled with the 70/30 and the glargine okay so but what we just need to do is titrate up or increase what you're on now right uh it's a little bit of a better you know regimen so let me see i think we'll check the a1c today and kind of see where it's at i think if you're taking the 24 with meals and you're taking 20 just at night before you go to bed and your blood sugars in the morning are still high; they're still very high right um we should you're doing a lot of pop alright do you want to quit that alright okay um let's do that okay well it's tough for me to really know what to change when i don't see the blood sugar records okay let's take a look at your a1c; if it's still high then we'll consider increasing your glargine dose probably we'll probably do that i need to know also what your blood sugars are a couple hours after you eat and when you take the insulin with it because we need to make sure that that insulin okay is accurate so again bring in your blood glucose log in a month alright we want to know what the morning is and we also want to know what it is two hours after you give yourself insulin in the evening those are important to know right so we need to know if we need to increase the dose okay i'm going to be right back okay to what i don't know if i need to take a look at what else is going on this is the part that's the problem okay and they're being a little bit more stringent with us cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest does no longer qualify them for disability okay so i don't think because you can walk okay right yeah but i don't think unless there is one of the following conditions okay lung disease which i don't think you have alright right uh you don't have a heart condition uh you walk on your own; you don't have an assistive device you don't have @@@ or orthopedic condition that's severe right so i don't know if you necessarily qualify alright let's hope you don't alright hold on one second okay alright yeah so i think what we're gonna do because your blood sugars are so high in the morning in the 200s we want to increase your nighttime insulin okay so we're going to increase it from 20 to 25 you know what you need to do if you feel low blood sugars right i want you to then come down if you get low blood sugars in the morning i want you to come down back to 20 alright so you're gonna be taking glargine 20 and then the long-acting at night tell me what you're taking tell me what you're gonna be taking yep alright good today you're gonna go to the lab you're gonna get a couple lab tests and then i'm going to put in for the colonoscopy okay uh you want to come back in a couple of months that sound okay okay are you taking aspirin you are taking aspirin okay so you're not taking any other blood thinners no coumadin no plavix right you don't have a prosthetic heart valve no pacemaker no valve damage you don't have oxygen at home you've never had a heart attack okay no liver disease no heart failure and you do have some renal insufficiency do you smoke now are you using alcohol now uh and you have used heroin right how about recently have you had surgery on the belly before and no radiation to your belly that you know of no problems with anesthesia or sedation in the past are you you are taking insulin diabetic medication yeah okay so that order was placed okay and then the lab you go straight over to the lab okay you need any medications today i can certainly get you; you said mail the test strips sure we should probably renew all of your @@@ alright so mail okay you want them mailed okay um you're good to go take this up front okay see you back in eight weeks if you have any problems come back sooner okay um that's it see you sir alright take care </doctor> <patient> yes sir how you doing @@@ it's on my it's somewhere on these pages yeah let me get that it's in the bag he @@@ is out it says on the form @@@ report and uh i figured out last night in the morning my blood sugars we're high @@@ @@@ right i don't know it was @@@ this morning @@@ that was it @@@ @@@ and i been drinking uh right right i don't know i think it's uh when i was doing good i was uh taking @@@ insulin @@@ 24 units 24 twice a day @@@ right uh-huh right uh-huh i'm on aspart 24 and glargine is still at 20 but i'm still getting @@@ @@@ @@@ i'm doing uh the uh glargine is i think it's uh uh-huh uh she moved me to 24 i'm doing 24 uh-huh right uh-huh i don't know oh i have an appointment for @@@ the last i think @@@ the pharmacy @@@ right right @@@ before that but it was increased from the 15 to the 24 on the 30th uh-huh when i get up no @@@ uh i'm not sure i just go by the bottles uh at bedtime it says take 20 at bedtime and @@@ says 15 @@@ says 24 when i get up and @@@ right @@@ i drink a lot of fruity water @@@ water that's made with fruit right you buy it in the store its lemon flavored water uh-huh well @@@ well it goes down @@@ 182 it was down to 130 yeah after right it was like 180 @@@ right no i take it when i get up the regular one at bedtime right right uh-huh right right @@@ before lunch @@@ before lunch when i get up and then i haven’t been checking the regular you know right after but uh i do check it before doing it right 200 right around what i said earlier yes right i take the regular short-acting one at that time right @@@ a couple times right and i @@@ check it later okay i got i always write most of it down i can bring it tomorrow no okay @@@ right uh-huh i’m sure it’s bad right okay i know @@@ an egg taste in my mouth yeah not regular @@@ rotten an egg right what uh i take it every day @@@ i missed it maybe @@@ not at all @@@ @@@ @@@ very concerned okay let me do that yeah @@@ @@@ uh-huh is that it that's @@@ @@@ @@@ 120 and under okay right uh well @@@ @@@ around 12 noon yes uh-huh @@@ yeah okay okay right well then before i had i had one low i had one low level @@@ 98 right @@@ before before they increased it right right and i was thinking uh that the glargine is the long-acting 20 and then i was taking uh the 70/30 i was taking 80 and 80 of that and uh @@@ cause it was lower @@@ right okay yeah okay okay right right @@@ well not no maybe one yes i do yes i do @@@ @@@ @@@ okay okay okay uh-huh right right right right right @@@ it's pretty accurate @@@ possible @@@ @@@ secretary of state @@@ okay i see right right right @@@ @@@ no @@@ right okay @@@ okay uh-huh okay okay okay okay yes okay okay uh-huh @@@ 24 and @@@ 24 then 25 at bedtime yeah good uh-huh okay okay when will i see you again yeah @@@ pharmacy doctor right exactly @@@ yes uh-huh right no right no heart attack no very little yes @@@ a little bit @@@ trying to @@@ no no no (patient answers phone call on his cell phone) okay no i'm supposed to get some of that in the mail @@@ right yes okay doctor alright right thank you doctor thank you @@@ dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1275413 transaction # 578-10-2-316-0103 </patient>,False,1,True,1,False,True

today do you have any concerns or questions yeah so right now it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind um some of these symptoms um the shortness of breath and fever definitely can be covid and that's something that we are going to test you with and that's something we test everyone with um but because you're having shortness of breath uh we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well uh you can potentially have pneumonia that's not covid it can be any other virus or bacteria so we will get some blood work done we'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well um and then get a chest x-ray as well and if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer if you need any antibiotics within the hospital or you can take them at home so yeah we'll do a full physical examination and do all those tests and then go from there you're welcome um yeah we'll be there with you shortly can you tell me about any cancers in your family oh i am so sorry any heart conditions date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ okay but i see from the notes here that you've had some weight loss and they did some scopes on you from above and below and they found some ulcer in the stomach and they found an infection in the ulcer too so they gave you some medicine and they told you to @@@ here does this all sound familiar okay so did you get @@@follow up that's probably about two weeks or something @@@ oh i see it was last year but they sent you to get a biopsy on june @@ @@@@ that was like a year ago @@@ okay but you still don't feel that you're um weight and all that is getting better now you still feel like you're losing weight what made you go in to see them before the scope that you got um did you have pain or it was just weight loss so you didn't have stomach pain or bleeding from anywhere@@@ okay so but now but you think @@@ finished all those medicines you've been @@@ for two weeks okay okay um so you're still losing weight okay and oh well i @@@ office she’s still @@@ right well she's gonna hear about you anyway just @@@ she's still behind everything she's behind the scenes um

more of your blood pressure pills either how was your blood pressure today oh it was okay @@@ have you been taking this aspirin @@@ do you need @@@ the water pill hydralazine yeah i see that you've

give you a copy of this do you want to pick up today or do you want them mailed to you okay do you have ankle swelling no because you used to be on a water pill are you still taking it yeah there is an appetite stimulant that also helps with depression and it looks @@@ to stimulate your appetite yeah right you want to try that @@@ you just don’t feel like you want to eat @@@ hmm you @@@ normally taken @@@ um you want to just keep taking it now it can help with sleep your appetite and it can help with all different things you don’t have to have all those things to take it bu @@@ i wonder when the last time was that you had blood tests done do you remember @@@ so it's been a long time so you're due for some blood tests @@@ so i'll get those done uh the best would be if you could get it done when you're fasting do you live around here could you come back sometime when you haven't eaten anything okay so i'll order it and you can probably just come back in the morning when you haven't eaten to get your blood tests done okay okay just come on friday then that's okay you can come you can do it before or after whenever you want yeah as long as you're okay being hungry until afterwards you can't eat anything so if you want i think the lab opens at 7 if you want to do it like before your appointment that way you can eat something otherwise you'll get pretty hungry what's that yeah i think they open at 7 o'clock or something yeah @@@ see if we can get some urine too okay uh-huh did @@@ some of your medicines until get some of the blood tests that way you can get some of them today

<doctor> i’m just going to have a chat with you get an idea of what's going on and then i can go over it with the doctor will come back together and talk to you about the next steps how does that sound to you awesome ok it says here that you have been having a sore throat can you tell me a little bit more about that ok so you said four days ago ok so it's been kind of sore some issues swallowing food ok and over the last four days has it gotten worse better that it stayed the same ok have you ever had anything like this before ok is there anything that makes it worse or like anything that makes it feel better right now uhm ok and you said you've also had some difficulty breathing did that start around the same time ok yeah i can understand how that would be concerning we're definitely going to try to get to the bottom of it today um ok so started yesterday said then has it gotten any worse is it the same way better do you feel like it's all the time or is it on and off have you ever had any difficulty breathing in the past ok uh have you have you recently been in contact with anyone that's been sick ok have you traveled recently ok do you know if your immunizations are up to date ok that’s good see you so i'm just gonna ask you about a few other symptoms i just like to get an idea if there's anything else you been experiencing have you had a cough at all have you had a runny nose have you had any headaches have you had any chest pain have you have you lost any of your sense of smell or taste ok ok when did that start ok ok taste two days ago has it been on and off or has it been kind of constantly like a reduced sense of taste ok have you had anything like that before have you had any fevers ok have you had any chills or night sweats have you felt overall really tired and weak ok ok and when did that start ok ok ok well we might circle back i think there is any more questions you want to ask right now but just in general in terms of your overall health do you have any chronic conditions that you take medications for or see a doctor for regularly ok and what medications are you currently taking ok is that the only medication you take is that the only medication that you take ok do you have any allergies just gonna ask you few questions about your lifestyle do you live here in town do you ah live alone or with family ok and do you smoke oh congratulations before that did you did you smoke for many years ok do you drink alcohol ok uhm and do you use cannabis ok any other drugs ok and are you retired do you work ok what did you do for work before crock ok and do you have any family history of respiratory problems heart problems and ok uhm ok i think that that about covers my questions for you right now is there anything else that you wanted to add that i didn't ask you about ok i’m going to go over this with the document i'm working with today i'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19 that will probably do a covid swab and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms even if it is negative so that's just kind of a heads up on that maybe one of the next things that happens we will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there did you have any other questions ok well thanks for chatting with me we should be back shortly to kind of let you know with the next step thanks your culture results came back positive for streptococcus pneumoniae this is a bacterial infection i would like to take a course of antibiotics this should start to improve your symptoms with in three to four days please let me know if your symptoms have not improved or becomes worse date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ how you doing how you doing today good uh anything i can do for you uh-huh okay how long you been coughing up the mucous uh-huh what color is it okay sometimes white sometimes clear is it worse in the morning so at nighttime it's okay do you smoke excellent no cigarettes cigars tobacco pipe nothing okay um do you have any allergies that you know of okay that medicine lisinopril it's one of your blood pressure medicines the half tablet twice a day you've been taking that for a long time right okay well i thought you've been taking that longer maybe the same time as this cough that medicine's new well actually it looks like it was started in february of 09 yeah so it would have been about a year ago about the same time as the cough yeah time flies when you're having fun you been having fun a little bit of fun not too much that's right uh what about did you ever notice any like sinus drainage or like in the back of your throat when you wake up in the morning do you ever feel anything like there's something back there you got to clear nothing like that okay okay um what about do you ever get heartburn or reflux do you take medicine for it omeprazole yeah what pills are you taking just those two for blood pressure okay okay okay and that should be about it uh-huh uh-huh in january your liver function tests were normal yeah it looks like all they checked was your liver function yeah we should check some labs today check some urine today um and then the thing with the chronic cough like that um have you had a chest x-ray recently okay um have you ever been exposed to tb tuberculosis that you know of worked in a hospital or been in jail okay you didn't live with him or anything like that alright alright yeah i know it doesn't sound like tb so with a chronic cough the three most common things are could be a little bit of heartburn or reflux can irritate your vocal cords and sometimes you don't even notice it you don't even get the heartburn but enough acid gets up there to irritate it um another thing can be the postnasal drip like the back of your sinuses can drip down into the back of your throat irritate the vocal cords so it sounds like maybe a little bit of each of those could be contributing but also what might be most likely it's this medicine lisinopril that's it's most common side effect is a cough and it sounds like the cough started around the same time you started that medication so i think it would be worthwhile to stop the lisinopril see how you do um your pressure today is pretty good your pressure you know we may not even need that lisinopril on there cause for the most part like i don't think we need to replace lisinopril with another blood pressure medicine i think at this time we could just stop that and continue the water pill and if your pressure gets too high then we'll add a blood pressure medicine next time can you take your shirt off and i'll get a good listen to your lungs and you haven't noticed like any chronic fever or weight loss or anything like that have you could you take your other shirt off for me please big deep breath take a breath listen to your heart open your mouth say ah stick your tongue out a little bit real wide ah okay relax and then open wide ah again no pain here right yeah i think we'll try first stopping that uh stopping that medicine the lisinopril and that should take care of your cough if that doesn't work i think the next step would be maybe restarting that pill for your stomach because you could be having heartburn that is just enough to get up for instance since it's worse in the morning when you lay flat the stomach contents can kind of travel up your esophagus and then irritate the vocal cords it might not be enough for you to feel it feel the burning but it may be enough to cause that cough well start first with that lisinopril uh-huh i'll refill them sure i'll be right back i'll be right back because of your diabetes you should be on a medicine either in the class of medicines like lisinopril is in or another class which is very similar helps protect your kidneys especially in diabetic patients so um sound like a plan okay uh and then have you get some blood work today too so you can head to the pharmacy radiology and less than a month they'll schedule you your follow-up with me in four weeks alright and then oh head to the lab too cause that's gonna check your diabetes measures and uh some other blood work as well too lab pharmacy and radiology um actually outpatient is on this floor it's all on this floor yeah it's right next to the lab you now what i mean you're looking at the lab its right there alright i'll see you in about a month uh-huh uh-huh yep </doctor> <patient> thats great thank you sure yeah the sore throat it started about four days ago and it's really it's it's very sore i can drink fluids ok but i'm even having some issues swallowing food yes four days ago um the sore throat has it's got it's getting worse for sure i i i guess when i was younger i had mono and i had a sore throat when i had that yeah no not really i've tried you know i've tried gargling with salt water i've tried some painkillers like nothing nothing seems to be working yeah that's right that actually started yesterday and it's gotten me very concerned um the well i guess it's getting worse yeah it's it's just there all the time um no no no not like this um i have no i don't leave the house much nowadays i go to the grocery store i go

throat um i have mild copd um i'm on a long acting beta agonist pardon me and i also take a couple of vitamins um no no allergies i do i live alone i quit two years ago i did i smoked for 40 years i

what's up i'm going okay well i been coughing up a lot of mucous and it's been going on for quite a while now yeah and i'm just you know wondering what's going on with that it's been going on for seems like almost a year now i just went; you know i'm just really you know beginning to wonder about it you know it's kind of greenish looking uh-huh i'd say kind of a clear; mostly it's white and kind of greenish well in the morning time when i do get up i do it and when i do it a little bit during the day but i notice at nighttime i do a little bit but all during the day i notice some things uh-huh no i quit two years ago three years ago next month no not that i know of what is that oh okay okay yeah okay no i only been taking that about two three months now about three or four months oh it may be six months maybe no the cough was going on before that well i been on it okay has it been that long no i can't remember hmm yeah no i haven't been too dull though uh uh uh uh well sometimes

pressure pills i take stool softeners i take metformin and i take that you know the prostate thing at night yeah should be about it i came in here back in february i came to the emergency room and

<doctor> ok um when did this what can you tell me a little bit more about the cough itself any any sputum ok and any blood in the sputum ok and how much have you been bringing up would you say ok and when did this cough start ok and um any triggers or uh precipitating events for for the cough ok um and has the cough been getting worse or staying the same getting better ok um so it's been the cough has been happening on and off up until four days ago it sounds like uh is the cough happening daily now ok anything you've tried to make the offer better ok and anything you've noticed that that so i guess yeah anything you notice that makes it worse ok so exercising brings out the cough any other symptoms you've been experiencing besides the cough ok um have you been having any nausea or vomiting ok how about any headaches ok and have you had a fever ok and have you had any chills ok and have you traveled anywhere recently ok uh any night sweats have you had any racing of your heart ok and have you had any symptoms of fatigue ok um do you have any chest pain ok um any urinary problems ok any bowel problems ok any issues with your appetite ok any changes to your weight ok and any problems with uh sorry uh any recent infections ok um and these symptoms cold symptoms you've been feeling for the last few days ok and any problems with sleep ok uh any exposures to tuberculosis any exposures to inhalants like smoke or or dust or fumes ok ok and have you been diagnosed with any or treated with or any medical conditions in the past ok are you allergic to any medications ok um do you have allergies ok and any hospitalizations ok anybody you've been around who's sick alright and any surgeries ok any family history of asthma or or eczema ok uh and what are you doing right now for work ok and um where are you from like are you living at home right now or are you away for school ok uh and do you drink alcohol ok um and have you tried any other drugs besides marijuana so it sounds occasional ok do you smoke cigarettes ok and and uh can you tell me a little bit about your diet and exercise ok great i am sorry! he does have multiple trauma due to the accident and he will require aftercare date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hi come on back sir how you doing okay okay @@@ @@@ great oh it doesn't matter okay that’s fine yeah yeah okay okay so that's the spot in here huh okay sort of like swelling yeah have you gone to podiatry i forget yeah the foot doctors okay what happened to you okay yeah okay yeah okay you leave them off now if you like @@@ yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh okay okay now why were you laying down for so long okay okay alright so how is your breathing doing do you feel better yeah but are you definitely getting better with that virus you think yeah okay no fevers or chills okay okay you're not feeling real short of breath except when you really exert yourself yeah are you still taking the doxycycline the antibiotic they gave you the antibiotic they gave you okay okay okay well how do you think you've been doing since you stopped it yeah yeah yeah well i think i'd probably keep you on something um you're taking two tabs by mouth every morning and you were getting 80 twice a day i'd probably keep you on so i think there's a couple of things um you know i think you probably did have some gout which is why you got better with the steroids um and now we have you on colchicine which is another treatment for gout but the thing with steroids is you can only go on it for a short period of time cause it's really bad for you to be on colchicine you're on that now yeah so no i'm saying the steroids the prednisone is what you can't be on for a long time yeah so we gave you that for a short period now we have you on colchicine um and the question is should we continue you on that for a little while and switched it to a different medicine for the gout you're saying this toe here is still hurting you a little yeah yeah okay does it hurt you like just to touch it no yeah okay okay well i think what we could probably do today is stop the colchicine and switch you to something that you could take i think you know it looks like you may have a problem with gout you know over time so i think allopurinol is the medicine that you can stay on forever to prevent the gout from flaring up again okay the prednisone and the colchicine are kind of short-term medications to use when things are really bad but the allopurinol you can stay on it should keep that uric acid level down and it should prevent you from getting the flare-ups of your gout okay so i think we should probably do that today yeah well i don't know but maybe it was because you were not moving around very much for a couple of days and now you're kind of up on your feet again yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah well you know it takes some time to get into it so i think you know you should be pushing yourself a little at a time to get back if you can uh but it's not surprising that when you first really get into it that you might have some pain at the end of the day either okay so what you want to do is stay active and you know every day kind of push yourself a little bit more but you have to be kind of patient with this okay um i think we should definitely get you into podiatry because you despiste you know even once we get your gout completely taken care of and the fluid you have pretty beat up feet yeah so no it's fine yeah yeah so some of the pain i think may be just related to your the way your feet are yeah yeah yeah so they may be able to help just with some special shoes and yeah i was going to say yeah they're the ones that do the surgery too so you know yeah let's send you back and see what they think now okay it's not going to hurt anything oh yeah yeah yeah you've had a lot going on lately yeah well okay yeah yeah well even if it will take a while for them to get you in i think the next time they see you we'll at least @@@ okay that feeling of the numbness kind of @@@ has it been there continuously all day yeah and do you have numbness and tingling on the bottom of your feet usually no pain no okay so are you having much pain in general anymore or no okay okay okay i don't know exactly well that's a lot of; i wouldn't drink that much orange juice yeah yeah uh it's hard to say but i would kind of; it's good to drink water but not so much juice okay try to drink more just regular water you can have a little orange juice but no more than one or two glasses a day okay okay but yeah i don't know what would cause if you have continuous numbness and tingling in your feet then we need to know about it but let's see if it goes away i mean i don't know what caused it yeah so i think we just need to understand what you were doing with the water pills so you were taking 80 mg in the morning and 80 at night right and now you're not taking anything yeah yeah i think what i'd like to do is have keep you on a small dose of the water pill less than what you were taking just once a day okay yeah yeah take a deep breath okay you're not a smoker right they didn't do an x-ray of your chest when you went in no but not when you were just in the emergency room i’ll be right back yeah okay @@@ you know sometimes it does happen where people are predisposed but have never had problems then something happens a stressful situation uh whatever that would be uh emotional stress physical stress surgery and it kind of flares up so that's a possibility yeah yeah i remember what they were before yeah well we think it's a combination of gout and fluid in the ankles okay yeah you can give me a call yeah yeah i understand we kind of yeah ortho yeah i'd send you to @@@ ortho yeah she will make a referral for you to see somebody actually yeah so the rheumatologist is who we're going to have you be seen for your gout and also help you with your knee okay yeah but uh yeah @@@ yeah okay okay alright i think we're to go ahead and give you some medicine top pick up today @@@ i have another question @@@ well that's the thing; we probably would do it to keep it going yeah until we get the just a couple months yeah okay and even if you want to bring him back in a month or so yeah you know to check his uric acid and you could certainly test it in another month yeah in order to keep it simple and then prednisone and back next month and then start the allopurinol no i thought we'd go send him home with that since he's been start right now yeah have him start it in two weeks yeah check a uric acid level you know and @@@ yeah yeah i think @@@ okay sounds good alright okay thank you alright so we're gonna make some changes to your medications okay i'm going to write it down for you so you don't get confused okay this is what we're gonna do we're gonna stop the colchicine yeah no the gout's probably i don't know if any i don't know let's do one thing at once okay let's try to deal with this gout okay yeah so the prednisone will probably help with your knee too okay and what we're going to do is we're going to take prednisone do you want pick it up today or do you want it to come in the mail it's 3:40 well you'd probably @@@ so what do you think do you want to get it at the window okay yeah yeah okay yeah uh-huh yeah yeah well we'll get you taken care of i think you just have really bad gout and that's probably been a lot of your problems okay and a lot of people actually have it and you have a bad case but we'll get it under control so you know i think yeah one second okay okay if you need it that's a pain medicine okay yeah i can refill that for you okay so this is i want to go over the plan okay one second let me write it down for you so you don't forget yeah the podiatrist oh oh oh really hmm uh-huh no it isn't that's okay oh okay okay this is what i want you to do okay you're gonna take prednisone you're gonna pick it up right now 40 mg daily for five days which is what you did last time the difference is after that we're going to continue you on it but at 20 mg daily okay so then it's all going to be 20 mg tabs so for five days you're gonna take two of them and then after that just take one every day okay we're going to start with new medicine called allopurinol but not for two weeks okay so i want you to start it around may 10th okay continue them you don't stop this one so but um then start the allopurinol okay um and then the lasix or furosemide that's that water pill i'm not going to give you a new one but i want you to start taking 20 mg daily one tablet a day yeah just morning probably so you don't have to wake up in the night to urinate okay and i want you to stop the colchicine that's okay that'll be done in a few days okay that's the plan okay and call me if you have any questions okay and i think you're going to feel a lot better in this next week yeah and you'll feel it again and this time we'll be keeping you on that medicine for a while okay and then what we're going to do is uh we're going to send you to the gout specialists okay you're going to graduate from me to someone who only deals with really gout it's pretty bad yeah yeah yeah probably in a couple weeks so we're going to keep you on that and they're going to see you and @@@ rheumatology okay and i'll see you back in five weeks the next time and then we'll see how you're doing then okay we're making progress it's slow but we're getting there huh yeah yeah yeah this time we'll get it cleared up for you okay do you know where to check out right here oh i'll check you out; you can just sit down here okay yeah you do yeah yeah so why don't you check out why don't you check out with them okay okay yes uh i'm around here i'm at loyola but i'll call you back if i get a message from you okay okay it's good to see you again sir take care </doctor> <patient> i've been having issues with just a cough that's just been constantly like bothering me for the past few bit so yeah it it does have some like dark yellow greenish mucus material every time i cough that's not doesn't always happen but it's been worse like that keeps happening over the last few days no i would say every time i bring it up it's around like one teaspoon usually one teaspoon in the day um so i think it started around like i would say six months ago and it's kind of just coming it just keeps coming and going here and there but it's recently just starting to get very irritating so like six months ago i remember i was in just in phys.ed and we were just doing some laps and that's when i just really started coughing and yeah nothing else was really going on i just feel like when i started running sometimes i start to cough i think it was pretty it was pretty much the same over the last few months but then over the last week i would say just got really bad and over the last few days it's just been getting worse and worse oh yeah i would say like i'm coughing especially the last few days coughing several times a day um it's pretty random but like i would say throughout the day i'm coughing um i mean really i i didn't really know what to try um so no i haven't tried anything so yeah just like when i'm doing more activities especially running i find uh i just get like these coughing fits and it just gets worse when i'm running yeah it's pretty annoying because even sometimes when i'm just in class i just start coughing randomly but i would say it's the worst when i'm doing activities uh the only thing that sometimes uh like i panic sometimes when uh when i have like a really bad coughing fit especially in gym class it almost feels like i can't breathe and that's when i get really scared oh no no nausea or vomiting no no headaches uh i think i felt like a little bit warmer in the past few days but i didn't i didn't really check i don't think so no uh no i've been i'm i've been home no no nothing like that uh no i i think my energy levels are fine um sometimes when i cough like when it's really bad i sometimes feel like i get some pain in my chest when i'm coughing but that's only been the case for the last few few days i would say no i've been peeing alright no issues there uh no no i think i've been eating the same amount uh no still the same like i feel like i might have a cold but i think i maybe a week ago i had like a little bit of a runny nose so i don't know i might have a cold yeah it's almost up to a week now i feel like sometimes just in the past few weeks like i started coughing at night and woke myself up so sleep has been a little bit disturbed over the past few weeks oh no no not that i know uh no i don't have any pets like there's no like moss or anything in my home no fumes dust yeah nothing like that just just like with the skin i i i have eczema but nothing else uh so i for my eczema like i do have like a hydrocortisone cream that i apply but yeah i don't think i'm allergic to any medications i i do have allergies like sometimes around like animals like if i go to the farm or if i'm like at a zoo and just petting animals i get my eczema gets really bad no no no never been hospitalized no i've been i've been pretty much been at home so no one no surgeries i don't know bout asthma my mom does also have like similar like eczema to me but yeah nothing nothing else that i know of so currently like i'm not working i'm a student just doing some online studying i'm actually going to college to learn about how to make video games but yeah it's all just been at home right now yeah so i mean right now it's all online so i'm living at home with my mom uh not often like just when i'm at like parties and like when i was at school just maybe sometimes on the weekends but nothing regularly um just just marijuana i i try sometimes at parties but nothing like regular uh other than that like just sometimes i've been offered like some pills at parties but other than that nothing else ok nothing like it i'm not addicted or anything to any drugs i don't smoke cigarettes but i do have marijuana once or twice in a week i feel like i'm fairly active even though like i cough when i'm exercising i still play soccer with my friends and on a team other than that i like to go biking um yeah i feel like i'm still pretty active but it is getting more difficult with my cough other than that my diet has been pretty pretty good like at home especially i'm getting three meals a day and having a balanced diet so yeah i feel i'm doing well there yes hi how are you oh i'm doing alright the arthritis it's a little @@@ to walk after it's just that i had a little thing that occurred within the last 24 hours with my ankle yes the swelling has gone basically gone down yeah do i sit here or there if i just take that shoe off then i got to sit over here it that's the deal uh let’s see now basically you could see @@@ actually this one here is normal and this one is a little bit wider do you want to see my feet or well i have a pain still though in my toe alright these are socks @@@ anytime i'm walking i need and these are a little bit swollen right now well that's one half right here it's focusing right up in here somewhere when i walk i get pain in here now in the morning just right in here it'll be thinner in the morning that it is now okay podiatry no not at all if you can just give me a hand and pull that up it did swell on me my foot over here on walking because of what happened to me this morning oh here my ankles you tell me i’m just trying to get the initial stuff first okay now this one here you can see the difference here and this is the way it is usually at the end of the day kind of still swollen like that and in the morning this will not be like this it’ll be down a lot okay now a week and a half ago i got a @@@ should i put these on oh okay okay good uh i got a virus bad virus a week and a half ago i was in the emergency room @@@ get antibiotics for it its congestion and i'm sitting at home for three days on my back laying on my back and i don't know if it had something to do with my intake of the amount of juice that i had but i guess i drank 3 1/2 gallons of orange juice and lemonade and i didn't know it has a lot of acid in it and if that's just part of the gout or something maybe i'm wrong about it and maybe i am so anyhow i get this great pain right in here right through my ankles when i walk it's like pins it just occurred this morning and then also getting a little stiffness in my knees and it just occurred it started like yesterday i started sitting at my kitchen table i felt a little stiffness and then tonight last night i felt more and then this morning i was like walking like this pins and needles because of the virus i had i was lying down i was told @@@ that i shouldn't have done but i didn’t know the difference alright well my breathing is a little bit heavier now cause i got this virus now it's just something that occurred in my lungs well i hope so yeah because it was terrible i mean i was coughing up phlegm 50 times a day and now i've coughed up maybe a few times that's all uh no no no well i could sometimes you know if i go from the second floor of steps it's just i get the pain cause when you have pain you have exhaustion so you cough the what oh yeah i got to go four more days on it i got four more pills now i stopped taking the water pills about three days ago i don't know if i should have done that or not well since i stopped it you know like i said in the mornings they're thinner than what they are now but you know this stuff's come back every night and it's kind of like this so i don't know what to do and how long is it going on for you what i'm saying you know uh-huh colchicine yeah i got about maybe about eight more tablets ten more tablets i shouldn’t use that i don't have no more steroids yeah yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah if i bend it like this you'll feel it when i do one of these here you can feel it kind of from and it goes right up in here it's the main bone @@@ from the foot you know and it's kind of the same right here also alright no uh no no a little bit yeah right here now if i press down on this part i will get pain right here uh this one here a little bit not much uh-huh oh uh-huh uh okay now getting back to the second matter though this recent thing and like i say in my ankle what causes this really because um see i was moving around in the hospital tuesday i had to go to different departments it was tuesday yeah i think it was tuesday i think it was tuesday tuesday wednesday thursday thursday yeah and when i went home i was real tired out in my legs uh fatigued and they were in pain from walking just walking in the hospital here i don't think should that have been because according to my therapist i should be walking more and look at this now you know oh yes okay sorry about that this is uh due to a sport i know my toes @@@ and it's kind of taking up the parking place in the other toes and this one is coming in and my right one is the bad one i have this over here holding cause the toe kind of reaches over the first toe over the big toe oh i've gone to foot doctors before and it's pretty painful what they give you i know i was walking on cardboard at one time and it was awful i mean what i need is surgical where the toe is brought back @@@ this one is and do this you know yeah i went there one time and i did ask about my feet and i did and they kind of said no they can't do it okay yeah it's just that since the 4th of february i am just up to my neck with going to hines hospital coming here so much i just came out of a ptsd class which i was taking for like uh two weeks now and i've been coming here and that was out of the medical part and now the mental thing and then now @@@ and i'd of course like to get something done alright alright oh i see uh but can you tell me what i have cause like still with that it just happened this morning the pins in here and i can't in my ankles ankles when i walk yes uh-huh no no uh i get a little stiffness in the knees when i get going and they loosen up and i got more power in my right leg the operating knee is better @@@ and power but not recently in the last 24 hours not since i got this stiffness cause this stiffness also affected my knees too i don't know i just thought that maybe three gallons of orange juice had something to do with it yeah i know that now yeah and it does have acid in there right is it part of this i don't know oh i see uh-huh yeah but i was sick when i was at the house all day so it just occurred now this thing on the ankle yeah i was taking it in the morning and at night i didn't take it in the last three days one of the reason is cause i got so sick with this virus i just couldn't handle all the pills you know i wanted to get this out of me you know so i don't know if that had anything to do with the swelling right now yeah because you know the urination part is irritating after a while you know what i mean it's quite abundant yeah i might need to get something here cause i still got congestion no oh they took many x-rays of my chest i think before the operation oh no none yeah i think that the bursitis in my left arm is getting worse and worse so i'm just kind of living with it it's in my left arm right up in here it bothers me when i'm at rest you know yeah i'll take a look at it when i come back in okay how been doing there doc exactly that’s what it seems like yeah and it goes with you all your life i never had gout since this operation you know eight weeks ago what the heck caused it though and explain to me about the initial thing that happened over the last 24 hours my ankle right here oh my god it's like walking on pins again it was like when i those feet blown up real big before yeah but this is in the ankle right here and it just happened though it started last night in the evening is that gout or yeah uh-huh i see and would you guys maybe follow up on it in a week and a half or so i can call you ‘cause i know it's like a month maybe if i see you in between you know i'm just seeing you i mean i don't mind as long as it goes down uh but it seems like you know they go down in the morning and then in the evening they blow-up again cause i'm just walking i'm walking daily but not that much at all i mean what does it take for these things to go away i have a question like that you know yeah alright and then other thing is my injections i used to take the cortisone in my knee this one her i won’t be using that any more because it's new but my old knee i don't know who i talk to about that orthopedics or yeah you do really cause they used to give me injections three times a year and it helped me out walking yeah this thing flared up because i was here just two days ago i was walking up and down the corridor i went home and my feet and legs were very tired i put them up it was overnight and this is when they started to get stiff and stiffness in the last 24 hours alright see this here if i bend my knee right now it feels stiff right in here is that also affecting the @@@ why is the knee getting stiff all of a sudden yeah thinking of what i used to do i can still take a hot bath or something oh god oh what time is it now @@@ yeah i got to make it to a meeting well i thought they were open until around 4:30 or 5 like i say yeah i guess so that's all i can do if i don't fall asleep i'm so tired right now got up this morning running around before i come here oh boy i gave myself a little time you know but when you called and came back just sitting it seems like i'm losing energy somewhat i don't know why cause when i get up it's like there's a biochemistry that changed me since this operation and i had never been operated on in my whole life and never had anything cut open my body's rejecting this cut open and this was like i didn't even know this was major surgery anyhow a knee replaced bad case oh what about diet i mean i don't know you supposed to i can't eat red meat or nothing is this true or i had to do with raw meat or something i might be running out of hydrocodone probably i got about ten tablets left and i think i'm having them every three to four hours so i don't know if i should have you – should i still be on it yeah now i use it but i think i need it yeah i hope i can get any of these if i can get them at this time and and then are you going to put in something for me with the foot people what do you call them and i'll hear from them in the future podiatrist yeah podiatrist they were operated on i want you to know this by the other doctor just the right foot they just came with the hammertoe and everything else got screwed up after him you know like i'm not going to mention the names i mean he's a private doctor in park ridge who did it and uh it all happened after him operating on it he used to numb your foot and then i don't know what he did to it it was numb right there you know you walk off and @@@ first move @@@ name oh i don't see how i thought you'd said @@@ name i called a couple of times over the years okay yeah for five days yeah i'm now going to be picking both of them up 40 mg up now oh okay oh i see yeah oh may 10th yeah take this first these two and then take that right yeah i see well i’ve got so many those left just one tablet a day when's the best time to take it in the morning or oh i see yeah yeah i'm taking an antibiotic pill too i take one a day i never took so many pills in my life in one day and i've got such pills yeah thank you uh-huh thank you well the last time you gave me those other ones it did clear up quite fast well oh there is a gout specialist oh i see oh what's your percentage healed if this is gout right now oh yeah so like 90% @@@ so when will i see them oh i see right you know what that department's called oh rheumatology yeah i used to know a doctor who used to give me injections yeah okay well thank you doc well i hope so yeah it was just this flare-up that got me it wasn't for the ankle the flare-up that got me this morning i'd be alright; i talked to a companion of mine this morning and i said oh my god what's happening to me now you know i said here i said i'm walking like this and i'm feeling kind of pins in it you know uh i got to get travel too i'm supposed to get am i supposed to tell them about travels uh for travel pay @@@ because of the gas okay alright if i have any questions i can

<doctor> what brings you here today oh wow yeah um that must be really scary when did this when did this pain start three days ago ok and where exactly in your chest do you feel it ok and is it what kind of pain is it is it more like a dull pressure pain or is it a sharp pain how would you describe it a sharp pain ok um so it started three days ago has it been coming and going or has it been constant ok does the pain come on when you're doing any activities or when does the pain usually come on ok and um does it improve with any positional changes at all or anything that you do that does it help ok and has this ever happened to you before ok and on a scale of 1 to 10 one being the least amount of pain felt and 10 being the worst how much would you rate it ok and does the pain move anywhere in your chest or does it stay in the same spot ok and do you have any other symptoms like do you have any shortness of breath dizziness anything like that ok any any palpitations ok alright and other than that have you been having any other symptoms at all besides the pain ok um have you have you tried like any medications that has helped the pain ok alright um any recent injuries to the area like did you have any falls or anything like that any headaches nausea or vomiting fevers or chills any of those symptoms ok any cough runny nose any viral symptoms ok and have you at all had any dizziness or have you fainted at all ok have you been noticing any kind of weakness or numbness no ok and in terms of your past medical history do you have any medical conditions like diabetes high blood pressure any other diagnosis ok um do you take any medications ok and any allergies at all ok and any previous surgeries do you have any family history of any heart conditions or any cancers or anything like that it was just two weeks ago i'm so sorry to hear that yeah it must be really difficult time for you right now ok so you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well ok so we can definitely do some tests and see what was going on i just have a few more questions and then i'll just get to some of the management and what we will be doing for you in the future so currently right now do you work at all ok and where are you a student what do you do alright and currently where do you live do you live in student housing an apartment or a house right and you drink at all any alcohol ok and any recreational drug use like marijuana or cocaine and do you smoke alright so those are all the questions we had for you today and yeah it must be really difficult and scary for you right now but we'll make sure to get to the bottom of this to see what's going on so what we can do is get you an ecg to see how your heart is functioning and then see getting the blood work if we need it for the future but yeah right now i would say try not to worry too much about it right now and see um what some of those tests come back so yeah you're welcome i'd like to get her in to see you sometime next week for her enlarged thyroid yes she's experiencing increased difficulty swallowing she's also reporting throat tightness on an off date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ @@@ you had @@@ talk to me and @@@ everything else i need are there any specific issues or questions that you have @@@ okay okay i can renew them pain oh where do you have pain @@@ okay have you tried anything else like physical therapy oh okay um so you have this arthritis in your hips uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay okay okay i see um so i just letting you know that tramadol is kind of addicting and i don't want you to take it for too long that's the only thing that's why i want you to go to physical therapy to see if they can do injections there to see if that will go away and is the tramadol helping you i think you need something else that might be a little bit better and long-acting like meloxicam it's an nsaid it's an anti-inflammatory drug um it works on a different part of the pain system um and i can try to give you that and see how that goes and if that doesn't help you call me and then we can change it again so let's try that because arthritis is inflammation um and so we'll try to give you some meloxicam and see if that makes it better um so you take ibuprofen and does that work oh you don't need to take this you don't take this oh so you don't take it uh-huh oh really so it started coming back okay oh the ent doctors okay so you're going to follow up with them why do you have so many recurrent ear infections okay no not in your ears it makes you have diarrhea but not ears not your ears okay so so besides the arthritis and the knee pain um and the ear infection you have back pain okay um but you never went to physical therapy okay i think it’s a good idea yeah so because what we do is first we control the pain but if that doesn't work we always recommend physical therapy sometimes that can actually help a lot and if that doesn't work then you think of surgery and you think of other options so i want you to go through that level and if it doesn't get you to where you want it to be then we'll talk about something else okay um and then you got your labs done today which was great your cholesterol is excellent so good job i'm happy about that i don't have to adjust anything your creatinine is a little elevated the um your creatinine or um kidney function do you have kidney disease at all did you start any new medications uh-huh okay yeah so that's why so how long did you take the ibuprofen for just recently uh-huh uh-huh you took it four times a day you took it how many times a day once one or two how many days oh maybe three okay oh okay was this last week that could be the reason the creatinine bumped but so i don't want you to take this medication okay alright and so i'm yeah @@@ creatinine okay yeah it can but it looks like it's controlled with the 20 i don't want to decrease it it's perfect it's one of the most perfect blood pressures i've seen no let's keep it there and when did you start the enalapril uh-huh last year @@@ like in @@@@ june no @@@@ @@@ right yeah i thought about that too but and you're taking the albuterol do you have copd why are you taking this albuterol inhaler do you have asthma did you ever get a pulmonary function test where you breathe in tubes okay do you need this again or do you need refills mail it or walk-in okay mail it and do you need aspirin mail it again and i think you have two refills on there oh yeah i can just give you three refills oh i don't think we can oh really uh-huh well you're getting 108 in this pill in this quantity it says 108 so ask the pharmacist if they're giving it to you in 108 because it's in the quantity of aspirin so that's good it should come in the mail cause they'll put it in the mail right um and then do you need your blood pressure medicine hydrochlorothiazide triamterene medication @@@ oh good okay and then synthroid do you need your synthroid the thyroid medication anything else that you need @@@ ear drops okay um so you have an ent appointment today you should talk to them about that they're probably going to @@@ okay okay and when did this start six months ago and anything start to make it worse are you attracted to your partner yeah and is it that the libido that's gone or you can't get an erection okay so it doesn't last long enough but the libido the feeling is there yeah okay um and any discharge any issues there nothing like that okay can i just check @@@ have you ever been on anything before what was it vardenafil or viagra yeah vardenafil let's see what she gave you the last time you saw her levitra she gave you levitra okay let's see what else we can give you yeah sometimes that can happen but we have to make sure it isn't anything else too and no new medications that you were started on six months ago okay okay uh-huh and your thyroid are you taking that regularly cause your thyroid can also affect everything too you know things you wouldn't think of it can affect lot of stuff we could get a thyroid level on you the last one was in june let's see it's been seven months so let's get another one i can order it and we can add it on uh-huh oh okay that's good we'll order that so you said levitra did not work okay yeah that’s fine let me see what other medications we have that we can give you @@@ a lot patients come with the same type of issue don’t worry about it so um do you have difficulty kind of achieving them or is it that you can't you’re not taking too much alcohol you're not using any illicit drugs no heart disease or anything like that you do have hypertension right high blood pressure uh-huh not any more yeah that's true @@@ so let's see levitra yeah i know i'm gonna have to figure that out maybe you're going to need to get pulmonary function tests to categorize why you have the shortness of breath um and the wheezing only happened at night did it wake you up at night when you're laying down then you use the combivent or the albuterol inhaler how often do you use it every night uh-huh once every two weeks uh-huh oh really good oh oh so that's why you're here you're with me since she left that makes sense got it got it got it okay so let's see what else we can do now i see she gave you vardenafil which is let's just see the medication okay so she gave you levitra like you had said @@@ that way so 10 mg and then you used the 20 mg and it didn't help that's both of them uh-huh you don't remember if it was do you want to try that one again or not once you may be getting one because it didn't stay up right okay so you're able to penetrate okay but then it lasted only like 2 minutes okay alright so what i'm gonna do we'll order another one called viagra and then you need to use a full pill i'll give you four pills of that so that's that we took care of that issue and then @@@ @@@ it can cause @@@ so did you get a sleep study um they told you to do it again right but you haven't gotten that done so if the sleep study they said at the bottom they didn't tell you to take it again so you got it done in september 2010 and okay so they told us to repeat the sleep study in a few months so i might want to do it again for you are you okay with that oh yeah they'll call you and they'll figure out when to do it so you have daytime drowsiness you feel tired do you sleep well at night @@@ okay why don't we go ahead and do a pulmonary function test on you i might want have you do that that sounds like asthma i don't know so i may have you see a little pm&r the rehab based people for your back @@@ uh-huh and @@@ yeah and then one thing did they ever do an ultrasound of your liver where did they do it here oh and then afterwards they haven't done it okay yeah they were supposed to repeat in september but they never repeated it no the ultrasound while you're going oh this is the ultrasound scheduled so let's see when they were going to it september 26th we can wait on that no not this september it said it was scheduled and ordered and it was so hopefully might just have to call down and i'll make sure they have it in there uh-huh that's an ultrasound okay yeah so i think you have a gi appointment coming up so then they're going to do it then okay i mean that's a liver clinic appointment so they're going to do your liver ultrasound at that time and then if they think that you need to get it done they'll biopsy it okay no drinking alcohol right none of that okay awesome how did you get cirrhosis hep c do you now how you got hep c oh really what happened oh okay sorry about that but i think it's pretty controlled right now so were you on treatment in phoenix oh do you smoke okay one cigarette every two or three days okay and you chew tobacco how much a can a week and then do you drink how much do you drink do you average six-pack per week so a six-pack for every two weeks do you do illicits illicit drugs yeah like marijuana cocaine okay where do you live who do you live with are you sexually active okay where did you serve okay and did you see active combat any family history of anything cancer in your family history uh-huh uh-huh no cancer diabetes okay um @@@ your vitals look good um let's see what else so when did you get your colonoscopy done last what year was that okay so @@@@ was done in 11/10 can you bring the records from that at all to see what they say okay okay okay uh-huh okay so do you have records or not when will you have some hmm but they did did they ever say anything bad about it alright uh-huh did they remove anything did they take out 12 polyps or okay how many polyps did you have okay okay that's okay we'll figure it out you were locked up what do you mean jail why oh so you did do illicits in the past they aren't good right so tell me your other problems low back pain uh-huh uh-huh okay uh-huh i'm going to have you continue with the tramadol the one that you have only because i'm kind of afraid to put you on another medication because you have that kidney that creatinine level bumped up i am going to have you check your creatinine level in like maybe a week we’ll see where it is and if it goes down we'll have to put you on something else and we'll try to figure it out that way and you need to lose weight and i know you have been right um are you in the move program at all the move program oh you don't know about the move program it's this program that's for anyone that's interested in losing weight there's this program that is tailored to the individual and you get to work out and eat the way that they would like you too and it's pretty impressive what they do there i don't know if they feed you they kind of give you advice on how to go about what you should eat uh-huh oh really okay okay but do you workout okay well i think you should definitely do the move program though i think that might be a good way of like trying to lose weight i know you're doing the losing weight on your own i think you would benefit they way your knee pain your back pain all that will go away on its own uh-huh uh-huh okay so do you want to be part of the move program okay what club okay i've got everything down we talked about that so tell me about the shortness of breath so um what's going on when do you get short of breath walking how much do you walk until you get short of breath uh-huh you're wheezing okay and how many blocks can you walk oh you are since you lost weight okay so you're walking farther since you lost weight so you used to walk like maybe half a block and now you're walking at least a block okay okay uh-huh so um is it the pain that makes you stop or is it the shortness of breath that makes you stop walking so you can walk farther if you didn't have pain it's not the shortness of breath that's preventing you from walking okay so when do you get short of breath do you ever get short of breath or is it just the pain that limits you okay alright so if you're not huffing and puffing then that means it's not the shortness of breath that limits you alright but i'll send you in for a pulmonary function test uh but you do notice wheezing when you're walking you do notice more than you do when you're upright okay did you sleep with extra pillows or anything okay do you find that you're gonna wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air do you find that even when you get the pillows or something like that is this at night when you're laying flat okay and it's once or twice a week you use the inhaler and it goes away okay so i'm going to put in a consult in for the pulmonary function tests to make sure that we take care of that we would like to see now you do smoke that's a little concerning you've been losing weight any night sweats or chills that you've noticed recently night sweats weight loss well unintentional loss what did you do again to lose weight okay so what did you eat okay uh-huh okay oh for the last year or so you've lost probably like 20 pounds so that's good uh-huh uh-huh okay oh okay you might have to ask on how to go about doing that yeah you can do that that's another thing that they do you can follow that so @@@ no other phone that you have uh-huh well that's good okay alright so what are we doing for you today are you on any cholesterol medications okay you don't have any high high cholesterol good perfect okay um so i'm going to put in a pm&r consult in for you you're going to get a pft for your lungs your blood pressure's good @@@ diet you have an appointment with

don't have that um right when i left arizona so that would be in 2008 2009 2010 at the end of 2010 it was good no i had that done at um um @@@ where i was sent um something like ssi in phoenix and they scheduled that for me over there cause it was so hard for me to get to the va to do all my meds stuff and all that crap and then when they mailed them people were stealing them so i said well screw this i just went to access and i go to walgreens to pick my meds up so then i just started using them you know it was free so i said you know i just used that but no i wouldn't even know the first way about going to get it no i think they said come back if i still was there he said come back in five years or something like that i have a large colon but it wasn't no cancer no nothing no polyp you know no uh yeah they did 12 pinches no 12 things on each side um i don't think any this was uh i guess that they the @@@ detects yeah i don't know i can't remember what it was yeah so i know it wasn't cancer and i had it done the end of 2010 and i had it done in 2008 when i was locked up locked up jail um that's when i had my hey day of drugs oh yeah i know yes every once in a while i get a shooting pain in like my sciatic nerve where i used to get it i know right where it's at because @@@ my left foot i got i don't know maybe you know how you stub your toe and it really hurts well if i stub any one of these toes it don't hurt at all i mean when i hit something and stub it you know and i know i kicked it i says oh okay that's happened i don't have to worry about it cause it don't hurt but if i do it with my right foot then i'm hopping right alright right right oh yeah what what's that they feed you cause a lot of time i'm cooking for myself so i eat a lot of yogurt um i eat a lot of lunch meat and i eat a lot of oatmeal yeah instant oatmeal i eat a lot of that i have three bowls in the morning or if i don’t have that i have eggs you know um no but i ride my motor i guess i you know i lift my motorcycle tires when i'm changing them and stuff like that yeah yeah my my back doesn't hurt as much as it used to and i can walk straighter but i'm still out of breath a lot so i won't get up and walk a lot just cause after a little while of walking i start limping i don't know if i really have time for this i have a lot of responsibilities with the club and stuff like that and they keep me pretty busy the seagulls motorcycle club walking um from here to out of the building where the valet parking is i'm wheezing pretty good by then i'm pretty short of breath well it used to be not even a half a block and i would be so i'm walking further now yeah yeah yeah yeah i can walk over a block i think that's over a block and sometimes it's better than others i went to the bike show and i walked through that whole thing i didn't i hardly hurt at all but other times it's walking half a mile to get in the place and i was really hobbling you know it's like and my hip really really really hurt you know okay so it seemed like maybe my knee maybe it is getting better now pain probably right um i'll make a mental note of this well i'm always i'm always always i don't know i'll write this down okay yeah yeah i notice when i'm laying down i wheeze right i got a third pillow i use yeah no yep yeah yeah that i hardly use it at all right right chills no no no not unintentional my weight loss now is because i'm trying and i've been trying uh i'm back on all the garbage food you know but i live by myself now you know before i'd eat greasy hamburgers and fried chicken i don't eat that i don't hardly eat bread um if i have a sandwich i make half a sandwich with a lot more meat you know um i don't know and then my girlfriend when she comes out she cooks she is diabetic so she has to watch what she eats so i think that's where it ended up helping me because yeah it went up faster than that it seemed like in one week i went three four pant sizes when i quit working and could they get hold of i know they always call me on the phone but last night i spilled kool-aid on my phone and i really didn't realize it and all of a sudden i start talking on it

"<doctor> i wanted to talk to you about your family medical history family history plays an invaluable role in your health it provides us with important clues and insight to predict and detect diseases before obvious symptoms appear date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ good to see you how's the weather been treating you i'm just going to do your vitals they're gonna switch them over and they're going to do your vitals by the nurses now have a seat yeah believe me if i don’t do this we’ll be waiting a long time some people with work unfortunately @@@ not like you and me all this time you know keep this between you and me a lot of people with work ethics @@@ yeah i know you know especially gentlemen like you @@@ hard @@@ you know but @@@ you know people here they just don't appreciate that and people from a lot of countries come and take their jobs @@@ now @@@ @@@ old school so now all we got to do is @@@ @@@ you've got some guns on you and uh did you take your medication today you been taking the blood pressure at home @@@ what do you get @@@ blood pressure so we'll do it again after this how's the family been sit up it's still a little bit high @@@ are you due for your medications today cause that one goes up and down a lot you should be there right now right do you take your blood pressure at home and what do you usually get okay we’re going to run over to @@@ so how you been feeling since the last time i saw you still high how high @@@ that so you were on 5 units three times a day and 65 units of glargine what we could do if you don’t get… no @@@ okay let's see that's not too good not too good @@@ so then when did you start the 65 and you started on 5 units of aspart before meals three times a day and did you notice improvement in your sugars after you had gone up to 65 or was it still the same thing @@@ have you been peeing a lot have you been real thirsty any chest pain fever chills no trouble breathing what about trying to i mean obviously this does not you know help @@@ but what about exercise @@@ i mean i don't expect you to run a marathon now what happens do you get real tired with that what about when you take tylenol does that help you don't want to take tylenol the problem is as we get older we'll get arthritis too right yeah so you know when your hip starts hurting take the tylenol before before @@@ during just to kind of calm it down so you can keep walking cause you're doing the right thing and i know that your intentions are great but you just got to keep going you've got to find a way so you can keep exercises cause what happens when you exercise the muscles use up the sugar and you don’t need the insulin you use it up without insulin okay that's the way the body's made you know the muscles you know when you exercise they know that they can't wait for the insulin they predict you and they use the sugar on their own and they're going to be dropping your sugar level and it's a natural way of the body controlling the diabetes possibly going to 75 and maybe increasing the aspart to 8 units see how the 75 goes and if that's okay then fine and if it's too high then going up to 9 units no this is what happens this is what happens so you know you get diabetes so then your pancreas which is the main organ involved with making insulin okay so when you first start getting diabetes it's not making insulin well most of the cells are not working as they should be but some of them still are some of them are still working as time goes on the cells that are working start dying they give up because they get fatigued it's like pumping exactly so what you find is a lot of times people are controlled because some of those cells stop working and you get to the point that these cells kind of give up you know at that point the cells are not producing anything so and the that's the insulin requirements that you’re having is normal in the sense that @@@ you know what do you @@@ right but you know it's not giving up hope @@@ not getting better @@@ you're eating fruits; you're eating good meals and watching it at home you told me your blood pressures are less than 130s @@@ alright so you know don't worry about the you know i mentioned when you're at home just write them down for me you know write them and kind of keep a log @@@ but just write them down for me and bring it in so i can actually see it uh i mean the aspart i don't know if it's gonna do the trick @@@ we'll see how it goes we'll go up on the lantus first and that'll help you out other than that you been doing okay have a seat how's your vision doing have you seen the eye doctor yet and you're gonna see the eye doctor soon okay you can also pop by the clinic and let them know you’re supposed low vision don’t wait was it a long time ago @@@ yeah you should stop by the clinic and see what's going on say ah for me say ah but i know that some of this stuff would be definitely very helpful for you take a deep breath again again breathe normal now @@@ any leg swelling they both have a little swelling you're using the water pill right and when you're home are you elevating your legs you don't elevate them even when you're watching tv were you doing it well when you're watching tv or just sitting down you know on the couch just keep them elevated yeah @@@ your cholesterol looks great yeah metamucil is great those keep the bowel going right i might give you a couple of refills let me do that now you’re running low on a lot of meds @@@ i'm going to go talk with my attending and i'll be right back okay @@@ you’re having no problems giving yourself the insulin at all i know your vision is not the best but you can still see the needle and the line are you confident you’re giving yourself the right dosage 100% 90% 75% so on the aspart the to 100 want to make sure you’re giving yourself 65 i want to make sure about that that’s the issue i think maybe it might not have to do with how much we’re giving you but maybe because of your vision then you have a hard time doing it let me check something do you live by yourself or is there anybody at home that could help you with it so this is the stuff we're trying to figure out we're trying we're gonna try to get something different that's gonna help with that instead of using the needle we're going to try to give you these insulin pen okay instead of drawing blood like drawing into a syringe you're going it's a pump not a pump but a little contraption okay and then it'll show the number on it instead of drawing and looking at the lines you're going to set it for numbers and we think it is something that will help and it has a little insulin bottle do you think that's be a lot easier than the insulin okay so you’re over-compensating so let's see i think if that could work and we could get these pens it’s going to be a lot easier anyway and we should be 100% sure exactly how much you have okay does that sound like a plan oh yeah it's a blood blood pressure medication yeah it is for the kidneys cause the problem is your blood pressure and your sugar aren’t well controlled - those are the two most important things we got to get your blood pressure and sugars corrected okay and no overloading your sugars so your blood pressure @@@ okay well let me go check with him once more we'll have you on your way we just want to check out one more spot alright so um the only um @@@ short acting @@@ the only change is that um @@@ glargine and @@@ the @@@ pen is actually cheaper @@@ va physician prefers glargine can be switched @@@ unit to unit so that would be the preferred option @@@ there are two @@@ but can you feel it click to get your dose as opposed to having to measure you know so it's easier for people who can't see 100% anymore @@@ non formulary and i guess @@@ @@@ yes definitely okay good alright we'll do that we'll try to do this exactly the same so it looks right now a couple of things i'm willing to go up to 70 as long as you're more or less sure that you're giving yourself how confident are you that you're giving yourself 65 @@@ so we'll do 70 and 70 units at night right they are going to mail these okay actually you could probably pick it up at the window let’s see what happens okay are you talking about @@@ okay so we're giving you a pen for that yeah we're going to adjust the insulin oh okay i'm going to refill all of your medications did you have to pay for it @@@ it always help just having it syringes and all @@@ pens @@@ refills so you know you just put the little @@@ they'll show you how to do it put the cartridges in select the number and @@@ still using the  the hydralazine still taking you need lantus you're out of refills do you want more refills for the future the losartan okay the metoprolol quetiapine and furosemide omeprazole do you still get heartburn maybe once a week you get it does it only happen when you eat the wrong foods simvastatin are you using the vicodin [ill isosorbide and what about the vitamin d and they're having you take it once a week okay so i so how about i see you in six to eight weeks to see how your sugar is doing but in the meantime the pharmacist is going to see you again two weeks there you go and in the meantime i want to today to go by the lab and your kidneys did you get your flu shot this season (someone knocked on the door) doctor speaks to someone at the door um are you going to go see the eye doctor @@@ i'm going to set you up for another appointment so they can help you out @@@ okay and when you're coming in @@@ </doctor> <patient> okay how this will be helpful my mom dealt a long time with anxiety and stress disorder oh how you doing i'm doing good oh the weather's been fine that's all (laughs) hey @@@ @@@ the reason i called in @@@ @@@ oh no right you got to be kidding yeah i'm gaining too much weight doc and my blood pressure shoot up so it went from 125s to 130s uh-huh part of it @@@ uh-huh just fine 2:30 4:00 o'clock @@@ okay @@@ uh-huh 125 to 130 um good except for the sugars yeah well 240s 260s and i'm taking 3 something the other day i'm taking the uh 60s well i've gone up to 65 of the glargine in the evening and it still be 200 when i wake up yeah i always do that just like the mornings this morning it was that's what it's been @@@ 163 and i get i used to get 5 units of aspart but she had me on 60 units of glargine but they told me if it didn't do any good or go down in the morning go up to 65 it's not getting it done @@@ my sugars were better well now a week ago uh-huh right right the same thing after i eat dinner around 6:30 7 o'clock i'm not eating anything when i'm waking up @@@ 260 you know 240 oh yeah @@@ no not real thirsty when i wake up in the night i be thirsty no no yeah i try; i mean i try to walk a little bit yeah i might get on the treadmill and i might do seven minutes i know that ain't nothing but it's something right oh i don't get tired that quick but my hip i guess it's because it's not used you know no oh i have enough @@@ yeah @@@ you know if it's just from me not doing exercise i know i got that especially here you know alright uh-huh right yeah like when i walk i always get painful while i'm going coming back it's you know it's not too bad uh-huh okay is there anything in my prescriptions that could be making it right right yeah they're doing all the work right right yeah between 125 well i @@@ got ‘em written down i got a nurse coming a couple weeks @@@ let's go up to uh @@@ even 10 on that aspart i don't either but i can't it's hard for me to @@@ with one eye it's easier for me to see the 10 than it is for me to try to @@@ okay yeah uh been about the same bad they were supposed to put in a consult for low vision but i never heard anything about it no @@@ last month ah @@@ you know even with my glasses i can't see my watch this one all the time @@@ yes yeah hmm uh uh a lot of times i'm laying down and elevate it and when i go in the bed @@@ pillows it should because i’ve been taking that metamucil @@@ @@@ something in that medicine i'm taking it keeps me constipated i need a refill on the @@@ i mean i use @@@ right right right @@@ i have to look real close i have a magnifier even with a magnifier it's hard you know to see you know the lines oh yeah i believe so well on the glargine on the aspart i might miss you know one line or two on the glargine @@@ isn’t it marked i might go halfway that's the way i've been judging it now i'm all by myself (silence from 87:38 - 90:59) oh yeah so i was going to tell you was if i made a mistake it would be giving one or two units too much and not too less i could be i mean if that's my problem @@@ cause i have a problem counting those lines i'm not going to go under i'm not going to go over you

<doctor> what brings you in today ok um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago correct ok and then when did the cough start ok and then the fever ok ok um and do you how often are you having this breathlessness ok so alright and how long does it last when you do get it or is it just always there ok and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast ok sure and are there things that make make it better or worse ok um and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms ok has anyone around you been sick ok so they have similar symptoms to you as well then ok ok ok and have you traveled anywhere recently ok ok um alright if you were to rate your breathlessness from one to 10 10 being the worst how bad is your breathlessness ok and have you ever experienced this before ok and do you feel like it's getting worse better has it changed since you started having these symptoms ok yeah that was a good call and have you had any changes to your smell recently any anything like a runny nose or stuffy nose no ok how about a sore throat no sore throat any changes to your taste any changes in hearing ear pain or discharge from your ears ok any eye pain changes in your vision any discharge from your eyes ok and you mentioned fever and some night sweats how often are you getting these night sweats and do they feel like chills ok ok ok and any changes to your skin like rashes any weight loss ok yeah and the coughing are you coughing up any blood ok um and you said there's some sputum like pink tinged sputum how much sputum would you say you cough up every time you cough ok and do you ever feel like you're wheezing ok and alright so any chest pain ok how about swelling in your legs or in your limbs no leg swelling ok um how about do you feeling like your heart's racing no ok ok and any nausea or vomiting how about changes in your bowel movements ok how about changes in urinating alright any headaches any dizziness or fainting spells ok no confusion or memory loss ok and are you otherwise healthy do you have any medical conditions ok did they mention what type of chest infection it could've been ok ok are you on any medications ok and are you allergic to anything ok are you up to date with all your immunizations ok and and is there any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions no ok how about cancers ok ok so you mentioned you moved to canada from india about a year back where do you live now ok ok and are they sick as well or no ok and have they been to a doctor have they been investigated were they ever given a diagnosis ok ok um do you smoke ok how long have you been smoking for ok that's it's been a while then um and do you do you drink alcohol ok ok are you sexually active no ok have you ever had unprotected sex no? ok ok um did you have any questions or concerns anything you wanted to discuss that i hadn't asked you about yeah for sure so the first thing we want to rule out is tb because you have recently moved to canada from a country where it is i believe it is endemic so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with tb and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread so we can do like a afb smear or i think they have other diagnostic work up for that too so we'll do that first if not we can check to see if it's like another another typical pneumonia we can do a chest x ray for that as well if both of those turn out to be negatives then we'll have to work you up further for other things like copd or lung cancer how does that sound any past medical problems or surgeries that i should know of date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ well he is out today so i'm covering for him how you doing okay what's going on okay how long has this been going on for so @@@ last week you say @@@ okay and you're what are you coughing up how much blood spots of blood in the mucous are you coughing pretty hard like are you coughing yeah okay just yellow mucous nothing green or brown okay what else any fevers at all were you having fevers before did you measure it; was your temperature actually high what was it your blood pressure or your temperature yeah 100 over something okay but no fevers or chills right now um any shortness of breath no you just said when you cough you get a little dizzy does that go away after you stop coughing okay yeah is anyone at home sick okay does this feel like its getting better or it's been about the same uh-huh yeah did that help so it's mostly the cough and then when you cough you're getting a little bit of a headache um going on for like seven days no fevers at all no chest pain no shortness of breath nothing like that with the cough okay are you still having that just shoulder pain okay so where it's just pain it's just right here okay let me see something how bad is the shoulder pain on a scale from 1-10 but it's in both shoulders uh-huh did you hurt your shoulders at all have you been doing any heavy lifting at all what do you do for work do you work okay uh-huh okay but with the shoulders were those hurt in the accident too have those hurt ever since the accident is this different and how long has it been worse for okay but no new injury or anything okay in your shoulder or it hurts right here okay well i mean maybe you've got some arthritis in the shoulder or maybe there's something else we could probably just; we could try imaging you know we could get some x-rays to see if there's anything going on in there um let me see otherwise so you are 53 are you a smoker okay have you ever been excellent um did you get your flu shot this year do you want to get it today okay any reason okay okay uh-huh yeah that'd be useful to have here um let me see otherwise you're 53 have you ever had a colonoscopy they put a camera up your bottom okay i'll go take a look @@@@ okay it looks like you need another one next year okay are you still going there okay they gave some good pointers and things oh good how much weight have you lost let's take a look awesome okay you want to sit up here for me now when you cough and you get this mucous up does it feel better when you get it up okay so i think we can give you like a cough syrup or something that'll help break that stuff up a lot of times when people have symptoms like this it's just a viral kind of infection where antibiotics don't really work you know viral infections usually there's a lot of those going around right now you know the weather the way it is um they usually will last like 10 to 14 days and you kind of just let it run its course i mean it's not anything to treat really we can get you some cough syrup and things like that to kind of help with the symptoms there's nothing we can really you know we don't really need to treat anything so it'll go away on its own um yeah okay yeah yeah that's from the smoking yeah i mean a lot of people will kind of get like a small bronchitis you know cause smoke irritates your lungs yeah stick your tongue out for me say ah okay good yeah that @@@ at home your ear how long has that been going on for couple of months okay did you ever have your hearing checked okay alright let me take a listen here just breathe normally okay deep breaths in and out through your mouth okay great let me just listen okay any pain down here anywhere okay any swelling in your legs okay is that normal for you right right okay let me take a look at this one here okay now the shoulders put your arms up like this for me keep them up keep them up keep them up does that hurt okay put them out in front of you okay put them out to the side up above your head okay so i mean that's the fact is you've got a pretty good range of motion of the shoulders is a good sign i don't think there's any kind of serious injury or anything um i think we could just get some x-rays just to see there might be some arthritis or something there um it doesn't seem like that bothers you too much with the moving around right it looked like you were doing okay with that um so maybe we'll do some x-rays and we'll see how those look okay and that at the worst maybe there's some arthritis but just based on the ability your strength and your range of motion it's nothing serious i think we could go without the x-rays just to spare you the radiation cause you know how it leads to risk down the line in terms of the cough i'm gonna give you something called guaifenesin kind of like mucinex; it helps you bring up this gunk i don't think we need to i think it should get better over the next couple of days it sounds like it already is getting better the smoke being around the smokers is probably you know as you've noticed is probably contributing to it quite a bit so i would try to stay out of that as much as you can i'll write you a prescription unless do you have the cough syrup at home still so we'll get you some here do you want to pick it up at the window okay and then um other than that i mean your labs were last checked just in november so i don't think you need to come back and so unless something comes up until november well we got to make it for you but your next one; you have an endocrinology appointment in march march 1st that was the one you follow up for the you know for the testosterone and things like that so that is on march 1st at 10:00 a.m but to see us i think november is probably okay unless of course something comes up and you need to be seen sooner we can see you sooner okay alright so just stop by the pharmacy on the way out and then return back to the clinic in nine months there you go alright have a good day alright yeah perfect have a good day </doctor> <patient> so i've been having just a worsening breathlessness i've been also having a cough and i think i might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks yeah i'd say around the same time the breathlessness started so around six weeks the fever i've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks i would say two to three weeks um i would say it's pretty much there most of the time it sometimes gets worse when i'm exerting myself but i think just baseline i feel like i've been able to breathe less heavily than before uh it's kind of just there but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to i would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness i think it's more i just can't seem to take like deep breaths and then when i get breathless i i really try to take a deep breath but i just can't find myself catching my breath at that time so it's just more not being able to catch my breath uh not really i think it's sometimes moving around too much but like nothing nothing really causes it oh i'm not sure i i don't think there was any triggers so there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks so yeah yeah some of them like don't really have the shortness of breath and it's just like a cough but yeah there are some of them also have some shortness of breath so i actually came to canada one year ago i'm originally from india and i i'm i came here to study it can get pretty bad like i i would say up to an 8 sometimes maybe a couple times a week no this is like the first time i'm having this issue i think it's getting worse and that's why i was getting a bit scared and i came here no no changes to smell uh no not really no no no sore throat nope nope no nothing like that no nope nope i think in the last two weeks i've been getting it more frequently like i would say every other night i i feel i would feel chilly at one point and then i'll break out into night sweats or have to take off my blanket i think i measured it once or twice over the week and it did show like a fever of 102 no nothing like that i would say i think i'm losing a little bit of weight over the last couple weeks i haven't really weighed myself but i feel that i have lost some weight uh i don't think so sometimes like when i cough up like sputum there is like a little bit of pink pink tinged sputum as well sometimes it's like brownish in color and sometimes it's green but i haven't actually coughed up any blood maybe like a like a spoonful i would say uh no i i don't think so i i don't really notice any noises when i'm breathing no no chest pain at all no no swell leg swelling no no no nausea or vomitting no no it's been fine no headaches no nothing like that no um i think when i was back in india a couple years ago they did give me some antibiotics for like a chest infection but i couldn't really afford the medications and didn't take them i didn't finish the course but other than that nothing else no i don't really remember i think it was some kind of pneumonia just uh i take tylenol sometimes like it hasn't really been helping no not that i know yeah as far as i know nope no cancers that run in the family no so i live in it's we have like a student house with some of the students who came from india as well and there's six of us living together in in a house yeah so three of them actually have like two of them have a cough and one of them has some shortness of breath as well no not that i know of i think i might be the first one who actually went to a doctor i smoke like i would say like 5 cigarettes a day around 10 years no i i don't drink and i don't do any drugs either not currently no no um so yeah this is just like my first time visiting a doctor in this country and like i was just very scared that it might be something serious so just wanted to know what it can be that sounds good thank you nope none that i can think of right alright no i'm not i'm not feeling well well the reason i got a sinus cold and when i cough i'm coughing up mucous and i get lightheaded since last week yeah yep blood blood and yellow mucous spots yeah yeah yeah it's green green and yellow that's it no those went away yeah first two days it wasn't high but it was at just borderline it was uh 100 over something you said my temperature right no no that was my blood pressure i forgot what my temperature was no yeah yeah it hurts when i cough too my head hurts no i'm the only person staying in my place i think it's getting a little better it's better than the first two days you know i was taking alka-seltzer plus and i had some cough syrup that i had from the last visit yeah it helped uh-huh no chest pains yes yeah with the cough but before i got sick this whole left side from the arm got real stiff and this sharp pain went all the way up to the shoulder where i couldn't even lift my shoulder yeah in both shoulders now yeah yeah 7 yeah and at times both my hands stiffen up a lot no i was in a car accident in 2006 that left me in a coma and then i got screws and wires in both of my ankles and uh plate holder in my hip yeah yeah it comes and goes no i notice i can't even do an arm curl with the curl bar because right along there it's like it hurts real bad so can't do that and even when i when i start and i cut down on a lot of the heavy weights i'm not doing heavy lifting but when i try to do push-ups it hurts it hurts in the shoulders no nope uh uh no i'm not taking shots really i don't like needles i keep forgetting to bring my medical records here from rush that's where i was going when i was in a car accident and then i was in the hospital for at least three months what is that yeah they did that um about two years ago oh okay it was great no that was that was for about a couple of weeks so i finished that program yeah cause i lost a lot of weight i was 316 when i entered the program right now i'm 288 yeah i been swallowing much better once it comes up oh okay yes uh-huh i got another question i think i know how i caught it i have family members that smoke and when i go over to their house it's like damn like i be like you got kids and all the smoking and the next thing i know… my throat gets all scratchy yeah cause every time i get sick it’s coming from the next day i know it do it really irritates me so i'm gonna

<doctor> how are you i'm well thanks what brings you in today ok when you say the past couple of days do you mean two days three days four days ok so loss of taste so you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're just not getting the full depth of your taste ok so it kind of tastes like cardboard yeah ok umm did you have any trauma to the area like the mouth area or the nose area in the past couple of days or days leading up to that ok and do you have a fever at all ok you have a cough ok a similar timeline ok and is it a dry cough or a wet cough ok so no sputum no blood and do you feel wheezy at all how about shortness of breath ok sure yeah and how about any fatigue do you feel like you're more tired than usual yeah and i know you mentioned you're having a hard time tasting how about your appetite though do you feel like you've lost appetite yeah ok umm how about muscle aches ok and chest pain alright do you have a feeling like your heart's racing ok any changes in your bowel movements ok so some diarrhea this morning ok no constipation no blood in your stool ok how about your stool seeming like it's very dark almost to the point where it looks black ok good any abdominal pain any issues swallowing food does it feel sore as well ok have you had a runny nose or a blocked nose no ok any rashes ok and are things normal with your urine how about dizziness or fainting spells ok good good do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated or is this like a normal thing for you ok yep ok do you feel weak ok any confusion or memory loss ok good and you mentioned no rashes right ok any weight loss over the past couple of months ok how about umm night sweats or chills ok so kind of like you have a fever sure any muscle aches have you been around anyone who's been sick recently what kind of symptoms did he have ok so yeah some symptoms overlap with yours i guess have you traveled anywhere recently ok that's good and are you otherwise healthy oh good ok and do you have any allergies ok good have you been around cats recently ok and then any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past ok are you up to date with all your immunizations ok good any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions that you know of ok i'm sorry i forgot to ask you are you on any medications ok and do you smoke ok how about marijuana with like marijuana oh ok yeah how often do you use that ok and is there any tobacco in there or nicotine ok well you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine because neither of those are good for your health and so we can you know have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that i'll just continue on asking you some other questions do you drink alcohol and who do you live with ok do you guys live in a house ok in the city you said oh that's nice and any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know like it being an old building old carpets mold anything like that ok good umm alright so those are all the questions i had for you did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up yeah you know that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for so i would say covid or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year that would have less of a similar presentation and so we will do a covid swab for you and in the meantime if you could isolate for 14 days regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative and that would be great if the swab comes back positive we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics so that's where we will start does that sound good ok great well have a great day how are you feeling today ma'am are you still having the diarrhea and decreased appetite have you been peeing a normal amount when was the last time you peed are you having any fever symptoms audio name: e862 time started: @@@ dr enters: @@@ date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ okay what can i do for ya okay okay before that it was bothering you oh okay do you have some left knee pain that's what it was like before okay and now you're taking it off after dinner you've been able to walk okay okay you're not wearing any right now though now so who gave you that uh those medications that you're talking about okay that was when you were here at the er all right yeah all right i'm gonna read just looking at the x-ray report all right looks like things are doing a lot better the x-ray looks fine and it sounds like your symptoms are better now uh-huh let's take a look here all right so where was the pain mainly @@@ and now you're able to move it better good yeah alright excellent and the other knee how's that one doing yeah okay well since its since it’s doing so much better i don't think that we have a whole lot of work to do today i'm glad to hear that yeah alright i would say just follow that same pattern take it off a little bit earlier and make sure that you've got some stability alright good i think though looking at your numbers everything looks very good you're uh diabetes looks good no i can get it for ya thursday what's that oh yeah that's right you're going to be okay yeah yeah i don't know if this one's gonna be quite like that i don't think it is yeah it makes you think about that well come on up here ha ha yeah well you'll just have to see what happens that's okay i'll put it on over the top they already checked it once i'm gonna check it again i like your hat yeah it’s very nice @@@ alright you can lay back down i'm gonna i'm gonna go talk with my boss about what's going on but i think i like the way your knee is healing the knee finally the knee is finally getting better huh well i wouldn't give up on the brace all together @@@ alright yeah i'll be right back okay okay i think uh about the knee what i want you to do is wear the brace when you're not gonna be too active um during the day take it off after dinner you can try taking it off a little earlier each day if you want to make sure that the knee is feeling good and not feeling off balance or anything and then as you gradually take it away you won't need it at all but i'd keep it around yeah because i think it's gonna be helpful for you to have around if it feels unstable or starts to hurt again okay that's terrific no i'm i'm so happy for you as well yeah and you said they wouldn't let you stay there i'm grateful for how good you're feeling as well yeah sounds like a perfect fit for you yeah i bet they did in about three months so oh yeah let me order those for you right now either way would you like to pick them up okay yep you're welcome no don't worry about it this is one of the best experiences

i've noticed i just can't taste it i would say the last two days yeah just yesterday and today yeah i really noticed it with the pizza but with like other things too it's just a yeah really plain it doesn't really have any flavor with the food that i'm eating yeah kind of and i think like i mean part of that is that i maybe not smelling it as well either umm no not at all no umm i don't think so no yeah i've had a cough yeah that's when the cough started maybe three or four days ago yeah it's a dry cough no sputum and and no blood no wheeziness umm maybe after coughing i've had a hard time catching my breath yeah these past few days i have definitely i felt more tired i've been sleeping a lot more throughout the day and just i don't know kind of lazy i think appetite's been ok i've been hungry umm no just tired no chest pain no nothing like that umm yeah well i had diarrhea this morning actually none before that though it was just the one or kind of two times but it hasn't happened since then no i know i didn't see anything red oh no it it wasn't dark like that no umm no issues swallowing food my throat has felt a bit itchy i mean i've been coughing alot not really or just kind of yeah kind of scratchy umm not really umm no i haven't noticed any rashes yeah they are umm a little bit dizzy i when i got out of bed this morning but we sat back down for a couple of minutes i felt better i mean i guess i could have been dehydrated i didn't even think of that but i mean since the food didn't taste so great i don't know i probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days maybe i haven't eaten as much i don't know maybe maybe a little weak but umm just way more tired umm no i have been able to do some of my school work no rash i felt a bit umm hot but not sweaty just hot yeah i guess so maybe umm no muscle aches yeah there is this guy in my class who was sick in class last week well he had a cough and fever yeah i think he had a cough and a fever and somebody said that maybe a sore throat or something like that oh no i've been at home we just started back at going in person to school again yeah i haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past possibly cats but we don't have any pets at home no i did have my appendix taken out like 4 four years ago yeah at the beginning of high school but that was the only surgeryand everything went well i am yeah i have my immunization card here actually i know my grandfather had lung cancer but he smoked his whole life also also diabetes but don't know if he had any heart problems though umm i'm not umm i don't uh no oh but i guess i use a vape every once in a while no it's like those flavored ones it's like a few times a day i think there might be but umm i don't know i usually just buy the flavored ones yeah sure umm no i live with my mom my step dad and then my younger sister we live in a townhouse yeah yeah i live close i go to high school not too far from here no i live in a nice place it's usually like really clean i guess the only thing that i was concerned about was possibly having covid yeah that makes sense yeah thank you honestly overall i'm feeling a lot better yes but i'm still feeling better though yeah no problems there i measured it like you told me to—six hundred m l um it was about seven this morning no i feel pretty well yeah yeah well he well the reason uh we called today is they called me to uh uh talk to my doctor about the brace i had on my legs the reason i didn't uh wear it today is because uh uh the weather was bad and i couldn't get transportation anybody drive me so i took it off and drove it myself but for the past four or five days now i've been taking it off after supper which is 4 o'clock till about 6 and i'm walkin around the room and going downstairs and stuff like that not doing any steps and things and it hasn't been bothering me i got the new walker so it helps yeah i my balance and stuff like that and uh uh the swelling and everything went down and they finally took more x-rays and it so they said it wasn’t an infection or anything it was arthritic arthritic condition and they can't give me nothing for it until after the operation i'm having thursday not now no yeah this whole thing i couldn't sit and turn it i couldn't bend it you know like now i can i always have to keep it straight but for the past couple of months i've been wearing that brace and just taking it off at night yeah like uh about three days now i've been taking it off and walking around and    yeah now yeah yeah real good now before i couldn't without without that brace i couldn't walk uh i couldn't walk five feet no no and the antibiotics they gave me and painkillers they gave me have actually been killing killing the stuff and the swelling uh i got the paper here in the emergency room yeah yeah she didn't do nothing with me i haven't seen her since you know i think i didn't know you're supposed to talk to her i thought i was supposed to go back to the emergency and they would take it off or something that's the reason uh i couldn't see her until way up till next year yeah i'm smiling right in this in this area here i couldn't do this and if i did i'd be crying it's terrific pain yes if i don't if i don't like in bed if i don't push too fast too far uh i'm alright if i do i feel it but otherwise if i just take my time getting up and walking and turning and that stuff hey i can do without the brace i even drove a car first time in two months well that's uh it ain't bad but you know yeah they figured it's gonna go the same way and that's tough i don't know why yeah you oh god i talked it over with the head nurse at the retirement place and i said off the record i said what'd happen to me if i if i took it off and i sit for a couple of hours instead of taking it off at 9 or 10 o'clock at night and going to bed what if i take it off at 6 and walk around with a walker and she said try it so she was with me three nights in a row and she says how ya doing how's your balance you tell me how my balance is and she say you're good alright try it yeah yeah with this is the new walker that they gave me downstairs it helps a lot i borrowed a buddy of mines @@@ i used to walk with a cane but that was not stable enough and i couldn't drive my car but uh no as far as my sugar and blood pressure i i brought my books with me if you want alright okay alright uh-huh uh i need some test strips for my sugar uh do i call the    yeah oh okay i got about ten strips left monday wednesday and

went there the day after the monday after labor day and i didn't go back to work until the week of thanksgiving so all that time off i figured oh god this things gonna be the same way i'm kind of jumpy no and every time i hear the word malignancy that that uh that's what my wife died of yeah and me i as a polish guy that's a joke that's a joke i i you talk about being polish and that's got two strikes on ya but uh the first strike was in the 1970s with malignant cancer of the prostate @@@ was malignant so that's what i'm kind of scared of you want me to take it off yeah uh-huh that's yeah uh uh i was buying some tools at a tool place right by the house there and uh and she says my sister works there as an assistant or something to help vets and she gave me this hey i would be i wouldn't be smiling if it uh wasn't look oh god this thing's been bothering me for a long time oh yeah no no no yeah oh yeah that uh i got it right by the bed there oh yeah right i feel uh i could

before you have how long ago sometime last year i don't have any documents of you maybe i'm looking in the wrong place let me just check this oh 2009 yeah i found you okay how are you doing today sir good good anything bothering you today okay are you here just for a follow-up appointment okay the toe the foot doctor okay what's wrong with your foot you want it cut okay sure oh yeah you definitely need to see the foot doctor for that how long has your toe been like that does it hurt okay did you hurt your toe before @@@ okay i see and you're taking um hydrochlorothiazide is that from somewhere else your medication for blood pressure i see okay and you get all the medicines from there okay do you need any of your cholesterol medicine from here or you don't need that you can get it from here okay simvastatin you do get that oh you are oh congratulations okay um why were you in the nursing home to begin with i see okay and then you're moving out do you have a place to go to now oh great great and you want your medicines um so how will that work will it get mailed to you do you want to pick them up today then you want to wait for the 10th i could have them available for pick-up they're gonna be if i order it now it'll be available for pick up for one month do you want me to do it like that so you can come here and pick it up cause if i mail it right now it's gonna i don't know where it's gonna end up okay so how about i'll order it for pick-up and then um you can pick it up on the 10th okay no you don't need to; you can just walk in and pick it up oh no you can pick it up starting today i'm gonna order it today it's valid for one month so you can pick it up any time from today until december 22nd so you just come in and pull a number and pick it up if i were you i'd come early cause if you come early you don't have to wait if you come around 9 you'd probably have to wait an hour okay um i'm gonna give you aspirin and your blood pressure medicine and your cholesterol medicine okay i can do i don't know if i can give you that to be honest with you oh yeah perfect ask him to do that one okay cause i don't think i can do those oh thank you no hopefully yes no i'm seeing someone though (laughter) um anything bothering you today no headaches dizziness fever chills did you get a flu shot oh good no cough no stomachache no black stool bloody stools no pain when you pee no blood in your urine no swelling in your leg no rashes okay and your blood pressure looks great i found your labs and you can actually take a seat up here for me uh-huh yeah yep i can schedule it for you for today i can schedule you today and they can um let you know what time and date your appointment is no smoking you smoke are you interested in quitting do want any nicotine gum or any patches sit up here you want to try some gum okay nice deep breaths again how much um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day half a pack and how long have you been smoking for 38 years okay okay so the thing about the gum is that um you can't chew it and smoke at the same time so if you're gonna smoke then you spit it out what you do is you take the gum; you chew it a little bit when you get the urge and then you park it in the back of the mouth you don't keep chewing it cause this is going to keep releasing nicotine once that urge goes away then you park it and then you chew it again if you have another urge if you have to have a smoke then spit it out be careful @@@ okay let me order that for a pick-up do you want to pick that up today or do you want to pick okay sure all at once you want me to just order all your medications for pick-up today okay uh-huh do you know how much hydrochlorothiazide you're on is it 12.5 or 25 mg you don't know um hmm how do i order this then for you do you want to call back or how do you want this done because i don't know what dose you're on it's the lowest dosage okay do you take half a pill or a whole pill you take a whole one then i think its 25 mg then okay yeah cause half a pill would be 12.5 i'm gonna have these all available for pick-up okay whenever you want to come get them yeah any time between today and 30 days sure sure sure yes an eye doctor appointment at 2:30 uh-huh on the 7th okay okay i will be right back okay have you had a colonoscopy are you interested in having one um you've got to prep so you have diarrhea for about a day and then the procedure so when you go in it's uh kind of wait a little bit they prep you and then they go in actually it's a 30-40 minute procedure but there are there's a time period where you do have to wait while you're there um mainly because they give you stuff to sedate you and then you need someone to drive you home maybe next year okay did you get your flu shot this year you did get your flu shot okay great oh yeah you said that we're looking for cancer uh-huh so the reason why we um screen for colon cancer early starting at the age of 50 is because uh colon cancer is asymptomatic so a lot of times when you have it you don't even know you have it if we catch it early while it's still in the asymptomatic stage then it's easier to treat than if we catch later and it spreads everywhere um you might have some bleeding from below you might have some weight loss but sometimes you can be completely asymptomatic so you don't know yeah i mean so i mean do you want me to set you up for it or not right now not right now okay you're what hold on let me see i don't know were they working for you so these actually have to be mailed to you i'm not sure why they stopped i'm going to give you some more of those though no thoughts of um hurting yourself hurting others great alright i don't know what's taking so long for this did you page me oh yeah sorry can you take your shoe off again so she can look at your toe how long has it been bothering you oh okay so how long has it been going on looks like an ingrown toenail and it doesn't hurt at the base of your toe at all oh uh-huh lay back for me sir never hurts you at all no it's good that it's not hurting i'm just surprised that it's not hurting at all @@@ um there's no liver disease or anything do you drink sir good you're not drinking at all excellent (doctors talk among themselves) so uh you definitely have a fungal infection in your toenail um i want you to see the foot doctors and we'll see what they think would be like an option for you but cutting it with just starting you on a fungal medication and taking it for a while seeing what happens to your toe and if it gets better then i think in the end you're still going to need to get part of the toenail cut off and hopefully it'll re-grow normally but i think they're probably going to say you need to take a fungal medication for quite some time months in fact before they'll cut it okay cause this will probably control this infection uh when you have a fungal infection in your toenails it doesn't cause a blood infection it's not going to go into a bloodstream and cause you know sickness uh it is cosmetic actually this is quite severe uh in order for a fungal medication to work you have to take it the entire time your toenail is growing so you can imagine how slow your toenail grows you have to take this medicine for 2-3 months sometimes while the toenail is growing so all the new growth does not have fungus in it fungal medications can cause you can sit up can cause liver problems and that's why we were asking you about hepatitis prevention and stuff so you have to come in every one month to two months to get uh blood tests to make sure your liver is okay so uh it is an option i want you to talk to the foot doctors first and then we'll go from there okay so you can make an appointment up front with the foot doctors um i do want you to know because this is not painful it is in some ways cosmetic so if you decide you don't want to do any of these things because you're worried about hurting your liver or whatever then that's an option too because this is not going to cause a blood borne infection and this is @@@ so you have to decide if you're willing to take that risk i can't decide that for you okay questions okay so why don't you put your shoes and socks back on i'll put in the podiatry consult and you can make an appointment up front okay yeah they'll make it right up front yeah no i don't do that; they can do it up front though of course they can okay but we'll put the order in the computer for you today alright for this is for you take it out to the front desk and i'm gonna you to go to the lab to check your liver profile to get the liver labs you haven't had one in over a year okay so @@@ medicines @@@ hurt your liver it's something that you could consider @@@ talk to the podiatrist okay they can see if they can possibly treat it um after they cut it out and stuff and that is also an option but we're not the foot specialist and i'm not really sure what i can offer you other than the medicine okay go ahead and put your shoe on uh-huh i’m not sure how much you are covered if you like it should say on this piece of paper i do believe but it doesn't you can ask them up front how much what percent you are but it doesn't say right here and i'm not really sure where i would find it @@@ oh you're free to go all you have to do is go up to the front and schedule your foot doctor appointment tell them as soon as possible but they schedule it cause it's written on that piece of paper then go to the lab and get your labs done and @@@ back here feel free to pick up your medicines whenever @@@ </doctor> <patient> yes i do multiple i have them all written down on this yes about some time last year i think i believe you are in the red clinic i see that pretty good no i'm okay yes

<doctor> how may i help you ok and you noticed um and sorry when exactly did it start about two months ago and it's the 4th and 5th digits or any other fingers involved or any parts other parts of your hand ok uhm and how would you describe the the pain that you're feeling is it a sharp pain and an achy pain or a burning pain ok uh and do you feel any radiation of pain like in into your hand or forearm ok and alright is there anything that is aggravating or making the pain worse ok and is there any like like clicking or yeah any any clicking or catching when you're trying to like extend the finger ok and has there been anything that that you've tried recently that's improved the discomfort or or helped with the range of motion ok yeah certainly ok and what have you had any problems with your hand before like any trauma there or anything like that have you been having any neurological symptoms such as like numbness or tingling or loss of sensation to any parts of your hand or upper extremity ok so no muscle weakness ok and have you been having any fevers or chills ok and how about any night sweats and have you been having any unexpected have you had any unexpected weight loss ok and have you had any headaches any sensory changes such as changes to your vision hearing loss of taste or sense of smell have you had a runny nose or felt congested have you had any i redness or or itchy eyes alright and have you had a sore throat or cough how about any shortness of breath or wheezing have you had any chest pain any lightheadedness dizziness or feeling as though you might faint you got any feelings of though your heart is racing ok have you had any nausea or vomiting any abdominal pain have you had any diarrhea or constipation alright and have you had like any blood in the stool any urinary problems like pain or frequency an any skin changes like rashes ok or any changes to your nails or hair like you'll notice like plaques on the nails or or hair loss ok and have you been having any muscle aches or joint pains or body pains anywhere else alright and uh have you had any memory loss or confusion ok and have you had any appetite loss or fatigue alright and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions ok so do you take any other medications or is it just the statin ok and have you had any prior surgeries or hospitalizations ok do you have any allergies alright and are your immunizations up to date could you tell me a little bit about where you're living and who you're living with ok and are you working right now ok uh and have you been around anybody who's been sick ok and sorry as a construction worker i have you had any like any puncture wounds to your hands or anything that like any like slivers or things that have gone into the skin alright ok and have you ever traveled anywhere recently been around anybody who's been sick do you smoke cigarettes ok and you smoke marijuana ok uh and do you drink alcohol ok like one or two a day ok and you use any rec other recreational drugs at and or any iv drugs and have you in the past ok i i see and that's good then uhm anybody in the family have any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family ok and how about any autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or hypothyroidism ok and as anybody in the family had a dupuytren's contracture before ok and so uh next i just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion so just a couple more questions so when you're looking at your hand are you seeing any swelling redness ok yeah but no redness ok and are you are you seeing any uh like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist ok and uh are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain ok i see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension ok and with the on the nodules and stuff do you feel any like crepitations or like crackling or rubbing over those those areas or your palm ok and any issues with your like wrist or or elbow ok uhm so i think that's everything that i wanted to ask about today did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions ok i'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called dupuytren's contracture but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger based on the the symptoms but the fact that you're not having a fever you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis but it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that but for dupuytren's contracture it'll be a uh do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand can you tell me something about your mom and dad like any diseases they have had how's about siblings miss any health issues date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ oh yeah oh yeah doing very well how about you yeah good have a seat enjoying this nice weather good yeah i do uh yes oh uh-huh sure we can i think so i think so let's get to your latest up this is your cbc which is your blood count your infection-fighting cells white blood cells are normal so is your hemoglobin those are your red cells and your platelets all normal your electrolytes and normal potassium is on the high end of normal but fine uh-huh nope normal fine uh creatinine is uh 1.04 we'll compare that to the last one but that's fine and this is a measure of your liver function it was within normal limits and these are the lipid panel for your cholesterol and your triglycerides let’s look at the trend for those so we'll look at your past ones as we look at this so today your triglycerides are 293 ideally we would like them less than 150 so they're high and in the past they've been better the last time it was 160 180 down to 94 here they have been worse back in 2004 you were at 368 so uh total cholesterol we only go up to 200 you're at 188 good work hdl cholesterol that's the one that's called the good cholesterol well i think you know it's still not as especially the ratio between the good and the bad cholesterol in your good the higher the better you're at 37; we like to see it above 40 uh-huh yeah it's still less than 100 is what we consider good and you're at 92 so good job the last time it was 55 so it was even better down here it was 150 so you weren’t going so good back then but these are pretty good numbers uh-huh yeah have you taken aspirin with it no that's something that can help but i with this uh with these tests i wouldn't want to start you on anything new so uh-huh yeah so how long has this been going on and you notice it at night and where exactly on the elbow right there okay push on it any new activities yeah you how do press down against my good and then lift your palm up lift this palm up right here and push up does that aggravate it at all anywhere okay how about with movement uh-huh but if you're reaching right through here okay alright no we'll not do that first we'll know the reason @@@ we'll do that second yeah just a little shot how much is it bothering you uh-huh okay um and then on the so i think this pain is probably more elbow pain but up through here on the other side it's more of a shoulder thing okay okay did they start about the same time okay uh let me see your range of motion lift both your arms up over your head okay and then reach back behind your head that's good a little less over here very good stand up for me raise just the uh left arm up all the way above your head now lower it slowly no problems with that yeah what is this scar from oh oh okay alright one or the other alright any tenderness let me know year's worth of what ills okay alright and the pain goes right through here uh-huh any tenderness just gonna have you rotate your arm for me so keep the elbow in and we're just gonna rotate the shoulder out it's okay okay let's check on the tendons good alright just going to feel the shoulder go ahead and have a seat so that elbow the spot that you're so so that's the yeah cause that's the lateral uh point where there's an attachment there um where your muscles attach to your elbow to your arm bone here uh so then they call that tennis elbow have you ever heard that term yeah so the attachment point just gets inflamed a little bit and i think that's what's going on yeah it goes yeah so anti-inflammatories can help with that um the shoulder is you know a little bit different it's not really that one focus you know it's the pain here we're having pain here and there are lots of muscles that could be uh involved you could have like a minor tear in the shoulder uh both of the injuries though are usually repetitive injuries so um tennis the repetitive hitting and with older folks and i know you said you're not doing any @@@ wow is this his yeah anything with repetitive motion so writing reading @@@ yeah uh have you tried tylenol i think that would be the first thing that i would try uh i mean we could give you something stronger yeah so okay sounds good i like it um any other problems yes oh there are lots of scratches yeah no let's not do that yet yeah uh-huh anywhere else that you okay it looks like you have some just dry irritated skin that you've been scratching scratching that yeah you could use some actually uh steroid cream until it goes away and then just some lotion if you're able to not scratch it i think these could okay no @@@ so just have a seat over here let me take a listen to your heart and lungs and oh @@@ just breathe normal okay deep breath in alright breathe alright i'm going to listen to your arteries i'll have you take a deep breath in and hold it okay and breathe take a deep breath in and breathe alright just feeling your thyroid @@@ good any problems with chest pains pressure yeah it's a long story okay turns out to be uh-huh okay uh-huh yeah uh-huh let me rephrase my question any changes any changes in that yeah okay uh-huh we'll get more aggressive hmm uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well i want to go over your meds with you okay alright @@@ okay i do discontinuing that okay and you're doing okay mood wise okay okay yeah a little more active hold on @@@ you want 90 day supplies or 30 day supplies okay next okay and these are all ones that you have been taking correct okay alright next okay uh-huh it should be no hold on i used to know these yeah when i did more outpatient medications through the va the pravastatin is similar to the simvastatin yeah let's see how much you were on on simvastatin oh you were on simvastatin 80 um yeah so it's not quite equivalent let's stay on the simvastatin if that's okay with you okay uh-huh diabetes yeah i don't think it would be so did you get a script for that already or not you need one for that okay uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah at the va they did uh-huh yeah you did what do you want to add uh-huh do you want it through the va or written at walmart okay omega 3 i doubt if we'll be able to do 3000 a day here 2000 a day uh-huh um i can look back and see i don't even see that you were on omega 3 here yeah omeprazole @@@ that's your ppi it looks like did you have like an egd that showed gastritis yeah so a ppi for gastritis no problems with heartburn okay alright i do yeah okay what else uh do you want a multivitamin or what vitamin a multivitamin yeah we have those really for just a month though whoa okay i take a multivitamin and it's i think yeah @@@ uh uh no i think it's like $10 and it lasts me 2 1/2-3 months okay dominic's oh just get generic i don't get okay okay oh i put the omega 3 in there but no vitamins oh yeah yeah the va should get more competitive they should match wal-mart's price $4 a month well yeah but it's nice to have everything all your medications from one spot yeah like probably scripts should price matching if i were in charge that's what we would do yeah we could see no no i don't think so either so metformin and okay 15 mg alright no it says two weeks only va pharmacy @@@ i don't show what it was okay or you can call me and use that @@@ let me just try and enter these anything else you need alright i know a year i do i do i do have some reminders that they want me to do with patients every time so one of them is one of them is falls have you had a fall uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay alright no you know i wouldn't say normal but i'd say it's common with age or when people get less active your muscles aren't as strong and they stumble and you know @@@ and have more problems than they were when they were younger it's @@@ uh-huh like what uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah so that's pretty common those things that you're describing with aging no the ones that are you know the medical reasons like alzheimer disease the most common cause of memory problems due to a medical diagnosis uh those people think that they have - they're memory is just fine they're doing great so you yeah well they don't basically don't feel that their memory but then things start happening like they didn't turn off the stove they can't find their way home so then they won't say that they're lost they’ll just keep i mean i had a patient who was out biking for 16 hours straight because he couldn't find his house but wouldn't say that he couldn't find his house those are things that are just red flags i can't remember so having an acquaintance name that comes to me at night and those things those things are not worrisome well no okay i'll say i'm glad i realized that i’m forgetting @@@ so @@@ and actually hiv screening would you like to be screened for hiv alright alright well let me give me a few minutes and i'll be right back i'm gonna talk to my attending okay alright alright he agrees with the plan okay @@@ uh-huh oh uh-huh uh how does it how does it bother you so derm usually considers things like that just cosmetic so why not you'll be a whole new man when i see you oh i do yep leave a message with my nurse nurse best way to reach me yep it's on there nurse uh they do have it's not really e-mail it's like a website that you can use so they for health protection information laws the hippa rule so you can't use e-mail oh me oh that's fun how about six months or sooner if you need it yeah yep you're welcome very good check out @@@ check out is this way </doctor> <patient> yeah i just came in here today i've been experiencing some difficulties with my right hand especially at the bases of the 4th and 5th digits i notice this happening over the last i'd say probably last few months it's been getting worse i've been having trouble just kind of extending those two fingers and i kind of see like this little bump at the base of those two fingers so yeah overall it's just been difficult working i'm a construction worker and i don't know if this just keeps getting worse probably two months ago months ago no it's just those two uhm it's more a kind of like a aching aching pain which gets worse with if i try to extend those fingers and yeah like that i do feel like the little nodules but like pressing on them doesn't hurt or anything like that uhm no not really uhm i think just a extending it's it's i would say more than the pain it's just like discomfort and just not being able to extend that is is frustrating uh like the pain isn't that bad like there's like minimal pain uhm i would say there is a yeah there's some like catching i would say if when i'm trying to extend no nothing that i've tried that has really helped and yeah i'm just afraid if i stop kind of exercising and it'll just keep getting worse uh my my construction worker so there's always like a lot of i haven't had any falls or injuries on my hands luckily but there is always just constant lifting there's i used to drill a lot too so there's like always constant and i'm right handed as well so there's always like the vibration yeah so but no no direct like traumas or falls no numbness or tingling and no weakness or anything like that no no no no nope no nothing like that nope nope no nothing like that nope nope no nope no nope nope no no no nothing like that no no not really no nothing like that uhm no uhm they say i have like some high cholesterol i'm taking this medication like a statin and but other than that umm no it's just a statin uhm i did a have a acl repair just when i was probably 18 no not that i know yep yeah so i just lived with my wife we live in small apartment yeah just as a construction worker been doing that for the last probably 10 years no not any puncture wounds like uh yeah i sometimes get splinters here and there but nothing like nothing recently that i can think of that has been anything worrying or significant nope nope yeah i smoke probably a pack a day for the last i don't know like 10 years not that much probably just a couple times a month yeah probably a couple of years a day yeah probably one or two sometimes 3 no i haven't tried anything beyond weed i don't wanna try any other stuff uhm not that i know nope uhm no i haven't i haven't heard it now not swelling i just yeah just those nodules and i get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when i extend my fingers no nope yeah there's just some discomfort like when i at the bases of those two fingers like if i press on the nodules like it's sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it's not too bad like i i don't but i don't know i have a pretty high pain threshold too so it's hard to say yeah definitely i would say more painful than if i try to extend it myself like just forcing it back but yeah but not not anything too like i like it's not sharp or anything like that uhm crackling oh no not that i have noticed no not that i know of no i think that's all mmmm ok sounds good sure my dad died of heart attack when he was sixty five and my mom died of stroke when she was seventy no my brother is healthy yeah hi how are you you know what i gotta find out; i was expecting some old man yeah i'm pleasantly surprised actually i was expecting a young man probably how you doing good uh i'm doing i guess you know alright for my age yeah okay trying to yeah yeah anxious to get out back out there this afternoon i had an appointment here this morning so i left early this morning so go drink coffee revive me you live in chicago or where you know where viagra triangle is i go down there and drink coffee a lot cause i'm an old man i'm looking forward to just stopping by there on the way home and having a cup of coffee out in the sun catching some sun so how did my tests all come out do i have another year okay okay it was on the high end of normal is that should be more toward normal or oh okay alright good yeah yeah what was that yeah that was the good life uh-huh okay yeah they said really it doesn't matter that much anymore the news account on it but you know yeah yeah yeah it's always been a little low on that and on the ldl i've been normal haven't i or have i been a little yeah okay uh-huh yeah okay alright yeah i never have been able with this uh is it niacin that i take to get the that thing it's like i'm going through menopause i get hot flashes i can't take it i can't handle it i've tried it twice and man i'll be sitting there and i'll just hot all over burn no yeah yeah okay so uh i keep hoping that my elbow here right elbow and my left shoulder and maybe a little bit of my elbow really bother me i think its arthritis or something i sleep on my side and i always have my arm up under my uh hand and can't really do that now because it starts bothering me if i do that so sometimes when i'm just sitting this one will bother me the elbow will start aching i don't know if there's anything i can take for that or do for that or it's probably been going on a couple months now at night and the daytime when i'm walking or something sometimes too you know it can happen in any position really i notice it more at night when i try to put my arm down and put my head on it it'll go uh no well about right here yeah yeah yeah i can feel it there when you push on that yeah right there no me at my age yeah i do skydiving and i got a trampoline the other day and i um underwater basket-weaving i been doing some of that no no that's fine in that hand uh not that way no but if i go to reach to my back like if my belt gets twisted now it's not doing it now it's okay now but normally it would be yeah i wouldn't be able to do that and the same way with this one i get it right through there yeah just sort of catawampus when i go to like go back like that uh it bothers me a lot amputation okay alright the second give me a shot huh now i uh i don't know uh enough that it's very very very annoying and it probably is i don't know if it's stopped any of my activities it may have slowed me down from uh reading some because sometimes when i hold the paper or a book it might bother me slightly right now cause it squeaked all the way here you know when you go to the garage and you get there it doesn't squeak but uh probably if i had to say on scale of 1 to 10 probably um 4 to 5 i mean it doesn't it sort of keeps me from sleeping a little bit but not if i get tired i'll go to sleep you know i'll sleep through it so yeah it's like a shoulder i mean yeah uh-huh yeah they did uh-huh yeah yeah yeah now this starts hurting when i get up to there this one doesn't uh-huh ooh that bothers me like that yeah yeah that no that feels better when i lower it like when i hold it up yeah that's from where they took a vein for my heart not shrapnel or war wound yeah no no brings up something else that have i remember all my ills i have this @@@ about a years worth of ills ills to lay on you @@@ oh i ought to mention that to the doc tell me what that is yeah yeah you know yeah and it's back it's sort of on the whole shoulder there yeah no no okay that's okay uh-huh okay uh-huh yeah right there is where it is i can feel it right there uh-huh oh certainly i think that's what both of them are just some but i thought maybe they'd go away and i can't not sleep on my arm i just couldn't try to go to sleep laying straight and it doesn't work but it seems like that might aggravate it i don't know uh i don't know but i think the arm is just temporary uh little bits of pains you get you know and discomforts you get as you go through life uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i have a friend that goes out and hits a thousand tennis balls a day and he's 83 he doesn't like to play tennis with anyone he likes to hit the ball sure yeah i don't do the only thing i do is type on the keyboard and that's about maybe reading you know some but i don't read the same i read some newspapers and some books and then some kindle and you know so it's nothing where i'm always holding it the same way you know yeah no i can do that that's not a bad you know yeah they gave me a steroid but that would after a couple weeks it'd probably come back and uh i don't need that done tylenol is fine if it gets so bad that i need a steroid i'll come back and see you yeah alright sure now this is gonna seem minor but it is but i live alone so i have nobody to tell me what is going on with spots i can't see and my shoulders just get for a little while i had a i get these still get it on my shoulders both sides and it doesn't seem to go away i guess i just scratch at the scabs i don't know if you can see but i can feel it all the way up here all rough and uh i don't know what i should i put something on them or should i is it one of those there where i don't scratch it you know like a cat @@@ but i think it's just something that's irritated and i scratched and then i just kept scratching it but i still i think scratch it at night sometimes it’s like a pin prick somewhere you know no this is the only spot yeah yeah i kind of figured that put some cream or something on it okay well i'll certainly try that i hate to bother you with that but i don't have anybody to tell me what it looks like cause i can't see in the mirror very well right okay take my hat off @@@ uh-huh yeah we better go into that when like i sit down it's a long story and if i tell you if i tell you you'll mention it to your attending and they'll say well you should go down and have your heart checked you know and do some tests i've been that route about three times and open heart surgery and i still got a slight i can walk from here to there and i'll get a burning across in my chest or i could walk from here to i live at irving park and pine grove and i wouldn't feel anything you know and do perfectly fine but walked and the knot it bothers me so i'll have to stop walking a few blocks away i may have to stop twice on the way and just stop for maybe 30 seconds and then you know sort of let it go down and sort of walk along a little more and then it'll start up again uh after i walk just a little bit i don't know what it is nobody's been able to determine what it is i have three or four angiograms and open heart surgery and i keep saying i'm gonna lose weight and if it doesn't go away after i've lost my weight then i'm gonna start rattling cages and saying you know we better find out what this is cause it's really debilitating i can't lot of things i can't do you know a lot of times i'll just go out and walk but i can't because and i'm sure you’re top notch but i know we're not gonna come up with any solution at hines right away okay any trends uh no it's pretty much just the same thing and it was there before i had heart surgery after i had the surgery it went away for a month and then it came back and uh it comes and goes @@@ i got to find out some reason for it cause it's just really disrupts my life you know i can't i like to sail and i can’t go out and do that but i got to work on that when i come back and see you i'm 160 pounds and i still have it yeah very aggressive but in the meantime i can just say well i got to lose weight you know i don't know i had a doctor once when i was oh this was back in the @@@ uh told you're fat you're overweight you're just fat right uh and your diaphragm your stomach and gut won't let you breathe that well so that's why you have no stamina now that wasn't necessarily what would give me this burning across here but what i get is the same as if you were were out of breath you know when you were running or something so i always thought maybe he was the one that came closest to getting what the real problem was i don't know yes we need i want to change almost all of those prescriptions that i still am gonna have to walmart cause i can get them at $4 a month as opposed to $9 a month through the va but i've got you know do you have a list of my meds there okay now bupropion i gave up on it yeah i'm not taking that anymore and i'm not seeing mental health uh uh yeah i'm doing about the same as before yeah i get i'm kind of starting to do some stuff now that uh i hope will uh help me a little bit you know get out of depression and i haven't been doing anything really at all except sitting around and reading and going to starbucks and uh that's probably not good for me you know maybe if i were 95 but i'm not yeah so uh i don't know how you've got them listed there we've got finasteride and i need that for walmart she did glipizide okay oh okay yeah i'm sorry uh 90 you might as well um isosorbide mononitrate yeah uh-huh they're down on the list lisinopril i'll tell you a story about all this when we're done and i'm not sure uh i don't know if simvastatin is on wal-mart's list or not i don't let's see uh anything like that oh right uh-huh oh okay well we could if that's suitable we can do that yeah uh and this is what 40 okay yeah we'll keep that at the va and then uh sitagliptin uh i don't think i see that on here either what's that on that's diabetes and that's not that's not on here yeah uh no i need one for that so you're doing that's va va okay then there's a couple i want to add so i called up i got a walmart express up by me and i started going there after they opened and then the pharmacy looked nice so i hey give me your sheet do you think you can save money for me yeah here's our sheet shows you the prices you know just have your doctor there at the va call me you know or send it over so i called out here to the pharmacy and told them what i wanted to do and they said well you have to go to your doctor to get scripts re-written you know and of course my doctor gp was gone and i hadn't seen you but what they did at the pharmacy being the nice people they are they just cancelled all my prescriptions yeah and i came out here they said okay we'll give you ten days you know that'll get you up to where you can see your doctor but they just said you know said okay if you're gonna go to walmart and your doctor will be writing them we'll just cancel them jesus a little harsh but anyway i lived through it yeah and i want to add a couple too if i can i'd like to add i used to get omega 3 through the va and it's cheaper than uh i can buy it at the store that stuffs getting expensive so if you could write that uh va and then uh the same with uh omega 3 and then well i was on 3000 a day of that oh really wasn't i on 3 at one time you can't tell i think name at cardiology put me on that really hmm omeprazole what's that now i don't remember that but anyway uh well i was getting a little bit at night but it's gone away now i think it's you know it comes once in a while i just take some tums and uh well do the omega 3 do you think 2000 a day would be enough okay i'll do that you're the doctor i think that oh can you do the vitamins prescription va a multivitamin yeah $9 a month is cheaper i think than i can buy them at the store i think man some of these things that i look at them they get expensive like 17 18 bucks for a bottle yeah i don't know yeah what do you pay you just steal them at a pharmacy you like uh you know nurse jackie you never watch that oh oh well don't put it down then i'll just find out where you shop dominic's oh that's too expensive for me i can't afford that stuff i know no i buy generic everything i look lower shelf you know alright i'll find them along with the omega 3 oh okay alright you have okay okay that's fine that's fine alright now i got into this is too much for me to keep track of all these different places i wish you know the va should publicize this a lot more $4 a month is much better than $9 a month i mean and these are $4 a month well all our @@@ tell people go to walmart and get your drugs you know it is that's what's you know getting confused here yeah yeah i don't know why if walmart can do that i would think that the va's probably buying almost as much as walmart maybe not quite as much but wal-mart's pretty big yeah they should be just about the same though anyway they're not gonna change that on account of our suggestion i don't think are they i was thinking i had one other thing that i wanted to lay on you i know i hope they take it with that is that what yours says too i know i know she got crossed that out on one if it doesn't work i'll have them call her okay okay yeah sure i'm trying to think of uh um can i call you from the bus home cause that's when i'll think of it no i think we pretty well covered everything i could lay on you he got how long you been here you like it sure i don't smoke you know i was talking to the guy there you know the nurse and uh the past maybe a year or more in six months i seem to stumble once in a while even if there's just a little uh height difference in the sidewalk i'll catch on it sometimes it's like almost i have dropsy with my feet you know i'll be walking along and my foot will sort of you know uh sort of drag my foot not so someone would but notice you know i notice it because i'm i'm doing i don't know i think it may be my glasses as much as anything plus i have a lot of trouble going downstairs not a lot of trouble but i have to be very careful cause i can't really judge i don't want to go to therapy though so if that's what you're asking somebody suggested that this morning and i'm not agreeing i'm not a i'll just have to put up with it you can't give me some medicine that'll cure that no is that something that's normal not abnormal yeah i need to get yeah okay yeah that's a good thing to tell me when you're not active and yeah i need to hear that yeah uh i thought of something else i was gonna ask you about oh memory uh the name of a singer or the name of a town or the name of uh i wouldn't say a close friend but an acquaintance uh they'll just; you know i can't get it and maybe in five minutes it'll come to me maybe at night it'll come to me but that happens; of course i think about things like this a lot i don't know maybe other people don't but that seems to happen to me a lot and i can be working on the computer and think i've got to do something and i'll look at this on this i should go to this website or look at this page and i'll put my head down and when i bring it back up i won't remember what it was you know what i'm saying what the hell was i gonna look at i can't remember you're no fun you're supposed to say i've got something so if i tell my friends i'm really having you know a day of i don't get a hole gee i can't remember i'll say oh i have no trouble with my memory i'll say ah you're sick yeah yeah yeah okay god that's sad yeah i don't do bicycling yeah well i suspected that but you still worry when it happens to you you're just gonna worry about it until you know you can say no i know that's common i have no reason to be i was seen once in my younger days this girl insisted i be screened i got screened and then she laughed well i was just kidding anyway i didn't tell you what i called her okay alright sure yes they okayed it huh good yeah i had one other thing you can just throw me out of here um i call him name but that was my other gp he was gonna refer me to some @@@ where the va wants to mess with this and this thing bothers me a little skin tag i got here it just bothers me no like there's one a little one there and one there would the va do anything about that or should i just go to my medicare people and say take it off uh i keep rubbing it and sort of pulling on it and okay yeah that's fine i understand that yeah cause i got i keep i'm paying a hundred and some dollars a month for medicare and i never have used it so why not go and have them do it get a breast reduction and some collagen yeah woman maybe woman or man now uh you got a card with your uh and if that other if walmart says i can't take those other ones have them call you okay nurse oh okay i don't know why they don't use e-mails i did that i used to go to the @@@ clinic and the nurse practitioner there and i e-mailed and it was so much easier she used e-mail i don't think she told them she was doing that but it worked out really well why don't they use it encourage that yeah oh i know all that yeah see i thought i put the fear of god in them you know i tell my friends i said i can put a suit on and walk in any hotel and any hospital in the united states at 8 o'clock in the morning and they'll say oh hello now we'll have an office over here my daughter works there in the media department so she gave me that but i have to try it out you know well thank you i'll see you again when do i need to six months i don't sooner is probably not you know no if i need it i'll just call you right alright thank you very much it was a pleasure meeting you and i hope that uh we

<doctor> what brings you in ok well that's definitely a fever can you tell me a little bit about when the coughing started ok so that's sort of two days ago and then when do the shortness of breath start within the last day ok and the coughing is that i dry cough or is it a wet cough ok uhm so no sputum or blood ok that's good and alright any chest pain ok any palpitations of your heart ok and any have you noticed like a runny nose or a stuffy nose ok no runny nose that's good and then any changes in your vision or hearing how about changes to your smell or taste been normal ok that's good and how about of how about weight loss ok that's good any rashes changes to your bowel movements ok ok when did the belly pain start ok yeah alright uhm and you don't feel gassy or or bloated ok uhm and no nausea or vomiting mhmm ok and any changes in your smell or taste ok no worries and any appetite changes ok alright alright and are you still eating the same or a little bit less yeah have you had any dizziness or fainting spells no any memory loss or confusion no joint aches or muscle aches ok and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions ok ok uhm and do you take any medications for these things ok alright and are you up to date with your immunizations yeah ok and how about allergies do you have any ok any family history of heart or lung conditions ok uhm alright any history of like cancers in the family ok do you smoke at all you don't smoke ok how about recreational drugs no ok do you drink alcohol one beer a day ok and where do you live right now ok and anyone at home sick ok have you been in contact with anyone who has been sick ok ok and have you traveled anywhere recently ok that's good and any reasons to believe you have old carpet mold asbestos pets anything at home that could be making your condition worse ok that's good uhm those are all the questions that i had for you today did you have any questions of your own for myself yeah for sure so that's kind of top on my list right now to rule out so we will do a covid swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results in the meantime you should isolate for for about 14 days and if your symptoms get worse go to the er and if you're experiencing things like weakness seizures like and you're not getting any better in a couple of weeks or you feel dehydrated otherwise supportive care at home keeping yourself hydrated eating well sleeping well all of those will definitely help as well does that sound ok ok yeah no problem i remember you mentioned that you had one operation done in the past did it come back negative date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ patient okay @@@ okay right down here how are doing good okay okay okay let me put it in for you is that okay okay what would you like today okay and he left over a year ago okay uh-huh okay do you see mental health at all or not or the doctor just renewed it okay oh really okay really so you only have me for a year cause i took over this clinic last year when i was a second year resident so i'm graduating @@@ check out today i'm only going have you come back in a year so you might see somebody different that's alright okay okay um any problems today that you'd like to address or just kinda of want to get your meds checked today okay they don't look like skin cancer to me so if it's like one color usually it's a skin color it's like different colors and it's irregular maybe if you do have skin tags that you get and do they start out looking like that they don't okay so how long has it been that size so just this summer i feel like they might even just be freckles if they continue to get bigger then you call in to see any doctor and at that time you can be referred to derm i don't think that looks like skin cancer it doesn't even look like basal cell and what do you do are you always out in the sun all the time you do okay okay and then anyone else in your family in your blood relatives have anything like this okay okay do you burn when you go in the sun or do you do you tan more than you burn okay so that's a good thing that means it's less likely that cause usually people who burn have a higher susceptibility to cancer people who tan naturally outside of black people and indian people don't get skin cancer it's very rare if we do that's because we tan we don't burn okay i mean there's a mechanism for that but i don't think that looks like skin cancer that looks almost like a mole to me okay but keep an eye on it though if you think it’s getting bigger and it looks different then for sure it needd to go okay um yeah so just definitely keep an eye on it i could send you now but i'm pretty sure okay why don't we so why don't you keep an eye on that and have your wife keep an eye on that okay um and in the next 20 minutes or so what else do you want to address for today cause we can actually have a six-month follow-up i won't do the yearly follow-up we can do every three months for now okay okay okay what do you teach oh okay at a private school okay cool um what else what is it tell me the three things that are bothering you the most and we'll try to address those today okay so no chronic issues then okay okay that we'll take care like i said so that's the big thing was medicine we'll give you your meds today don't worry okay so the plan for today our main thing is to make sure all your meds are in line and make sure you have enough of everything yeah so actually they've actually been really good on medicines so really they've changed a lot around with how the clinics are running especially the gen med clinics they made it a lot easier for us and hired a lot more nursing staff who are very good now and like so it's almost like loyola right right exactly who the doctors or the nurses no at least my team here is very good they're a lot better with everything now okay yeah okay okay oh really alright okay so right now it shows that you don't have any @@@ the hydrocodone tramadol okay okay i can renew that you're on tramadol for pain right right okay okay okay hmm right do you eat something @@@ okay alright so i'll renew these meds and then we'll go back through your old meds and see what you need to get okay um @@@ oh really we're going to change it to a 90-day supply alrighty so you'll have a 90 day supply do you want me to mail it or do you want to pick them up you want them mailed today okay so the hydrocodone i don't think they'll give you more than a 30-day supply so uh-huh really hmm okay no no no i know not the system but here mental health here is really good with like even when it comes to basic anxiety to like severe depression but they treat everybody okay okay okay yeah i understand yeah yeah do you teach ap chemistry okay okay great so @@@ oh really those kids are really smart wow do you teach any of the indian kids cause @@@ oh really oh wow i did not know that @@@ are not funny @@@ i feel like you don't make enough really i always had teachers because like in india teachers are highly regarded like as doctors lawyers and teachers are like yeah teachers are like cause my grandfather was a principal he was a science teacher back in india but then became a principal he was like the big dog in our little village very respected um you know and it's like even here like doctors are like patients scream at doctors demanding things versus other countries i'm like okay you're just a @@@ right i agree right agree yeah i know @@@ the @@@ i just wondered after a while do you still take ativan the lorazepam do you still take that yeah i know uh-huh uh-huh okay that's okay uh-huh okay do you want to pick this up @@@ the @@@ you have you want to pick it up you know it takes six weeks for this stuff to kick in right to fully kick in do you have aspirin and do you have tylenol okay so i'm not gonna order that then let me fill this out were you ever taken off of the gemfibrozil you were never taken off and you're taking 600 twice a day okay that one i do not see any refills do you want to pick up the gemfibrozil okay okay really do you want to pick up the ativan the lorazepam so that you can pick up so that's all the medicine @@@ so you don't want the @@@ how about we'll check your labs today if they're too high then we'll go ahead and mail it okay how does that sound psa yeah it was normal back then @@@ you're too young to have anything going on with that you're too young yeah okay we'll hold off on the @@@ okay so @@@ and the ativan you can pick up today the lorazepam i mean and then the gemfibrozil will be mailed to you um you had that familial hereditary polyposis do you have it too they didn't find any you are due for a colonoscopy in 2015 anytime between 2013 and 2015 okay um anytime between the age of 43 to 45 okay because i won't be @@@ alright well let me let me give you the niacin because if you haven't been on any of that stuff i'd say you need it okay @@@ probably @@@ okay we'll just do @@@ and you take one pill at nighttime okay um @@@ yeah @@@ people out there when you leave here yes yes do you drink at all okay don't drink or drive when you're on the ativan okay good really @@@ with that @@@ yeah you have to be really organized you know what yeah it's hard i don’t know how you do that do you teach multiple levels okay right um so i'll be right back let me take a listen deep breath in and out and again deep breath one more let me see your ankles real quick uh-huh alright i will be right back @@@ you are absolutely not interested in following with mental health even if it's over the phone @@@ to talk to somebody no no no there's somebody that can talk to you over the phone so @@@ a psychiatrist so if there's any like any issue that you ever want to talk to them for i can like plug you in and they can maybe contact you it's @@@ @@@ you don't even have to come in so it will be over the phone they'll call you @@@ so that way you'll know what your options are and what you could @@@ that's fine it's very difficult yeah i know yeah yeah i want you to talk have someone to kind of contact even if it's just to cope with the okay i'll be right back okay so i talked to my attending and i talked to my attending okay i just wanted to explain i know you were highly against and that whole department through here a long time ago okay so it's something that we usually kind of have to abide by because can @@@ medications but we need like a pseudo or formal evaluation so the rule is that either you have to follow a doctor i think two or three times within a 90 day period and i'm only here once every five weeks basically like i have clinic for five days then i'm off for four weeks and then a clinic for five days again okay so it's like those or two or three phone calls that @@@ can call you about so you have to talk to them and the only other thing is they the only reason why honestly from our end that we want you to see them is you need the medication management because they are well versed with monitoring for side effects and can titrate your medications appropriately we know okay this medicine is for this but we don't know what these side effects are we don't know how high should we go or how low should we go when should we stop the medicine and all we are taught is depression you take paxil depression you take elavil or whatever meds that are out there okay so that's why it's not so much that that's fine that's fine that's okay but the rules have changed like i told you so that's the only reason why it's not and if you don't want us to get @@@ no no no i think he wants to meet you you don't even have to meet him at the mental health you could meet him here

last two days no i haven't no yeah i've had like muscle aches i guess i feel like we've been getting older but no yeah i've had muscle aches these last couple of days as well kind of generally achy i have diabetes type 2 diabetes and i have high blood pressure as well yeah my weights a bit a bit high yeah so i take metformin and i also take an ace inhibitor and that's it i believe so yes no i don't think no no allergies uh no nothing like that no history of cancer in the family no not i don't smoke no i don't use anything like that yeah i'll have like one beer each day so yeah about yeah one beer a day umm so i live in a house with with my wife and ah and our son uh nobody's been sick at home uh i don't think so i mean i've been going out to do the essentials and uhm i i do work out at a factory ah and so i mean there might have been somebody there but i'm not sure uh no travel just been going to work and doing the essentials and home i don't believe so no we yeah it's a new a newer home and we've done some renovations no i was just worried that maybe i could have covid yeah it does thank you i had a lymph node biopsy back in september of o three fortunately yes right here i'm well how are you i was unable to get the blood drawn last night or this morning because of traffic this morning i come all the way from de kalb so that's fine but uh and when i had put in for my medication uh some of them were denied so and apparently they changed the rules or something where i have to go i have uh mild ptsd and anxiety so they had me on paxil on low dose paxil and lorazepam in case i have any no i've never he's the one that started it for me so i'm gonna go with @@@ so @@@ best doctor i’ve had in the 14 years i've been here so well i'm a teacher so they used to have me coming every three months to get blood tests but i just i was supposed to be on gemfibrozil and niacin as well but neither of those were renewed either so i still have some so i still use the gemfibrozil and i had high triglycerides is one other thing and low cholesterol well i have something my wife told me to ask you about she's a nurse in de kalb but her father has had bouts with skin cancer and i got these bumps that kind of started well i got a couple on each one of my hands but they're irregular shaped and well she said i might need to have dermatology check it so this is just it the skin tags i keep getting i do get skin tags no they just come up like little skin tags and then they just get bigger and bigger uh it just got i just grew these this summer i spend a lot of time out in the sun i have two daughters and since i'm a teacher i spend the entire summer taking care of them i don't really i don't really keep contact with my family much so i don't think so we have more bone cancer uh maybe once in a great while mostly i tan yeah okay okay right i had so much other stuff happening right now with my knee messed up okay well the three months would be excessive i'm a teacher right now and then i'm missing a day of school for today so for me to be here in the and frankly it's harder for me to be gone from school than it is for me to be here i'm a chemistry teacher yeah well my neck always seems to bother me that's why i'm here so i'm in the va system uh lower back has always bothered me yeah those are chronic but i worry about i've had a lot of anxiety attacks i think i've had more not having medicine and i think it might be because i don't have medicine that's huge yeah i'm worried about the meds that's a big chunk of that and then my knee which i'm already in the system with ortho for exactly and so you might actually get ahead of the schedule which is rare for me well we used to have some that they were mad that we were here and we're like wait a minute we're the veterans which is why you have a job you know it's so fun the nurses the nurses and this one i've never had a problem general medical it's the people that used to be what they called pod 4 back in the old days where they'd make you go all the way down four blocks it seems to get you to the clinic they were nasty to the vets and the hydrocodone is for my knee i actually need to renew that one somehow yeah that's supposed to be to supplement the meloxicam cause they told me i can't any more than one meloxicam and no other nsaids and then when the pain gets worse i have to take tramadol so i've my first neck surgery failed and then the vertebra pinched on the they didn't put the metal plate in the first surgery so the vertebra pinched on the brachial path of the nerves so i have permanent nerve damage and i constantly in a spasm in my left shoulder and down my arm so the reason i have the long term which it's been really really long term meds which i know it's not supposed to be recommended but we've gone through every nsaid that there is oh yeah that's the only one that hasn't killed my stomach yet i will warn you whenever you put in gemfibrozil for some reason they always like over send me they tell me that i'm supposed to be running out but i still have more i don't know how i take it like @@@ okay i usually get them mailed i still have a little bit of everything except for the head medicine that's fine just so you might have an insight for other patients when people who have the ptsd and that anxiety when we have to go over to the medical clinic there are some doctors that treat us like pariah because of that it just happens when i had after my first neck surgery i told them something wasn't right and one of the attendings from neurosurgery said no from ortho he said maybe we need to send you back over to the mental health so that you can actually see what's really wrong with you then next week neurosurgery checked it out and they put me i had surgery within a couple weeks after that so i have a hard time with anything going over to mental health because of that stigma that i'm by far i'm not crazy you know when other doctors treat me like that it makes me not want anything to do with that malarkey oh yeah i know they're good my thing is um my thing isn't so much with the mental health it's with the other doctors who treat patients like well he's still in pain because he's crazy that's that's just too much you know i'm a highly educated person; i don't appreciate being called crazy because i'm in pain you know by somebody who's never served a day in his life in the military i do not teach ap i prefer conceptual chemistry so i teach the general level but at the school i teach at my conceptual general level can beat most of the ap levels in most schools in the state naperville north is no joke when it comes to science that's who i teach all the really really smart ones i do i do i'm also a model un advisor and we'll be teaching applications in chemistry no i have to live in de kalb for what i make and it bothers me too especially when the regarded exactly well in a lot of places that’s how it is but no you have to realize though in some areas around here the doctors here aren't always the highest level i mean when that guy said what he said to me i wanted to just knock him out which one yeah what's ativan lorazepam is the one for anxiety that was as the as needed one you don't always need it but when you need it you really need it for my anxiety attacks i have a difficulty breathing and it's like fractured eyesight so they tell me it's kind of near for a while they were testing me for um so while they were testing me for what's the one for low blood sugar not hypoglycemia they were testing for that cause they thought that's what it was and then they eventually they finally we narrowed it down and found out what it was i'd really appreciate it i haven't had one in months oh yeah oh yeah but i need to get something working cause i've been going downhill for a while i do have some but they usually order that they send that to me cause they said they had to i don't know why but i have bottles upon bottles of that stuff no yes and then they had niaspan something that's the one with the aspirin i have plenty of that that can be mailed i'm still trying to go through the last bottle but the only reason that i had the aspirin was because of the niacin but that stuff made me when you take it you take the aspirin and then a half hour later you take the niaspan and then if i don't fall asleep fast enough i start itching from head to toe it's like the weirdest frickin feeling i definitely need it so i have to have that @@@ you know what i think he was trying to get me off of that one i think because i told him i was itching so bad i don't really care for it one way or the other if i need it because my triglycerides are too high that's one thing but if i don't need it i would prefer not to have that itching sensatioin yeah something about prostate and what did they find out i'm good you'd be surprised i have a family history of that so i have to get a colonoscopy ear;u two i'd really appreciate that okay yeah polyposis yeah uh they said i was okay i don't i don't know what they found i don't always i don't always hear the results of what they do they said that okay i'll be 43 that year okay did they even find anything with the test i have no idea all i know is that i think it was like 750 or something it was some huge amount they tell me it was at night take it before i go to bed so it flushes my system or something okay that'd be awesome whoever that is talking i know somebody that sounds just like her so when i leave here i go down to the uh lab and have blood drawn and then get meds @@@ very rarely i know i know i don't like losing control so i prefer not to take anything that affects my control or who i am my students say i have a touch of ocd @@@ being a teacher try being a teacher my student teacher just found that out this year she's freaking out about the organization required to be a teacher right now i'm only teaching one @@@ but that's actually even harder because you don't know um what you're going through like they blend together you don't know if you've covered everything in every period i got like weird coloration on my ankles they call it combat boot scaring but it's so hard for me to go there that would be fine as long as it's not like i don't want the stigma that's the big thing okay i can handle that it's just coming this far to you know i live with a job i teach and to come all the way over to @@@ only to have somebody place a stigma on you it's it actually i think increases the stress that'd be awesome uh-huh uh-huh no that's what's there @@@ mental health yeah okay okay so i have to talk to health that's fine i don't @@@ that's easy okay okay well the reason that they did it is i was on paxil before and that's the only reason that he was able to do that okay okay i don't have a problem talking to them on the phone okay that i can do it's just like i said it's just the stigma and it's just and it's just i don't have a problem talking to him @@@i’ve done that i just don't like that stigma it just keeps me from getting in trouble which vaccine really okay okay that's fine yeah okay and it's too early to get a flu shot right being in a high school i prefer to have that one so when i come in here for ortho i can get it yeah i wish they could have given me an mri later in the day though that's fine @@@ okay yes but they can call my cell phone i would probably use that that office thing that says 501 that number doesn't exist anymore number this is my cell phone that's the one i always have on me number number no the one that i just was telling you was 501 i forget even what it was yeah that number doesn't exist anymore the home is fine alright doctor @@@ oh no worries and it's up here that's where i always go i know @@@ i've gotten quite good at keeping records somehow i don't have to @@@ you didn't see @@@ @@@ teach you have a great day okay leave the door opened or closed </patient>,True,0,True,0,False,False

a pack a day roughly before 2004 okay and how are you feeling now sleepy okay but um any chest pain shortness of breath um feeling like your heart's racing fevers chills losing weight waking up drenched in sweat vomiting diarrhea nausea constipation swelling of your legs numbness tingling double vision okay do you need a mask or do you feel like okay but you sometimes you do feel like when you're driving you get a little tired okay anything run in your family any illnesses run in your family that you know of and any allergies to medications what happens when you take those oh okay sure okay um i think it is you finished your antibiotics um your diabetes numbers actually look okay kidneys look your kidney numbers look a little high were you not eating or drinking so well you know when you first had gone to the emergency room yeah yeah (doctor answers a page) sorry last time um so it looks like your cholesterol's a little high i think uh you know we could try to control that with diet and exercise but um but you know it's uh it's something to you know think about if um you know get you started with some medication once daily that you would take at nighttime that would help bring your cholesterol down you don't have any liver disease which is good um and i think let's see these are your last numbers looked good alright and you had an eye exam right in january let me take a quick listen to you take a deep breath take one more time very good breathe normally just regular breathing and this isn’t painful at all okay alright okay you haven't noticed a bunch of swelling in your legs yeah take off your glasses for one second and look straight ahead at me say ah good now do you have a tooth that's been hurting okay okay dental appointment okay um we should maybe give you like a topical or something that would help the pain you know like an orajel like a cream or something that might help swallow no lumps or bumps anywhere the 4th okay @@@ okay and your diabetes @@@ okay alright sir okay so um okay um a couple of things we're gonna do we're gonna start you back on your home meds okay on the diabetes stuff and for the blood pressure right so go ahead and start taking them because your blood pressure is still too high so we need you to come in two weeks for your blood pressure check you don't have to see me you can just see the nurse and they can check it really quick and uh you know uh let us know at that time you know if we want to then change your medications but there's sort of no point if you haven't taken it for a while we don't even know if what you're taking is working um there are a couple other things let's see okay so we're doing this we need your blood pressure; we'll get you a tetanus shot that's just the one that when you like brush up against metal or something like that like rusty metal you can get tetanus from that so it's a shot you get once every ten years it's uh and yeah that is not bad no usually it's just the arm soreness and many times there's actually you know they would prefer @@@ some people find that i'm sure you've had other vaccinations in the past at some time but it usually doesn't @@@ them um then um we're gonna get you an ultrasound of your abdomen i know they had done some pictures before but the think is that we’d like to see the part of your blood vessels where they go into your stomach because you have a history of using tobacco you're at increased risk of having what they call an aneurysm which mean that the blood vessel is big so for all men who are over 65 who have a smoking history you know it's for pregnant women it’s the same thing they just put goop on your belly and it doesn't hurt so i signed you up for that um so um @@@ we'll get your tetanus shot for your tooth i think i'm going to try some it's a topical thing that we give i think it's just the thing that you kind of put in your mouth and swish around like a mouthwash and you spit it out (doctor makes phone call) okay we're gonna start you on a low dose cholesterol medication the fact that you're a diabetic and you have high blood pressure means you should be on a cholesterol medication and a baby aspirin so we can address that 81 uh-huh and would like to pick up this medication here well i guess we’ve never mailed it to you @@@ so you should pick it up here right good oh does that work okay (doctor continues phone call) what other reaction have you had it has listed an allergy that you have had a reaction to anesthetics what happens (doctor continues phone call) okay i think we should be okay (doctor continues phone call) so i think we'll just try that it's like a mouthwash just kind of do that okay so um take your medications come back in two weeks you'll get your tetanus shot today um and then we'll @@@ does that sound good and you'll see me back in like six months sounds like a plan um let's see oh i have these to pick up here do you want me to mail them to you or do you want to wait okay so the shot you have to get here the shot unfortunately we can’t mail to you right cause uh-huh that's okay it should be alright well you know i mean it's just a mouthwash just try a little bit if you feel weird don't take it you know and uh i will send you with this so okay and then you're free to go teach um and um we'll schedule your colonoscopy they'll call you for that let me just make sure i get those scheduled alright here you go sir and um i'm gonna walk out with you to make sure that they schedule you alright you can go have a seat out there okay </doctor> <patient>

he wanted you to stop it though you’re not sure @@@ so you have you started the amlodipine @@@ @@@ cause your blood pressure is really high today so i just wanted to see how long you’ve been taking

those okay but right now your blood pressure is too high we need to control that high blood pressure is going to cause a heart attack a stroke and we don't want that you really don't we try to prevent anything bad from happening did you ever have that tooth surgery did you stop the penicillin or are you gonna keep going on it uh-huh okay uh-huh so looking through their notes i see no clear indication on why you’re on the coumadin okay @@@ uh-huh yeah yeah yeah along with the aspirin @@@ are you waiting for that to be mailed as well so if you feel safer they can @@@ with the plavix um but i would definitely recommend stopping the coumadin okay that's if you feel safer for that i don't think you need it but if it's gonna make you feel better its okay the plavix and the aspirin alone are going to cause enough blood thinning that it shouldn't be a problem but taking all three of those there is a pretty high risk of bleeding so i would recommend aspirin and the plavix okay uh-huh no i know @@@ uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay so you had some blood tests recently @@@ last time we checked your kidney function it was just a touch higher than normal and if we were going to do an angiogram they use dye for that and we want to make sure your kidney function is good so @@@ do it today or the next time you come we can do the blood work-up but the cardiologists are want us to check your kidney function again okay before anything happens um have you been checking your sugars at home and how have they been running okay good are you taking the metformin and the glipizide @@@ @@@ @@@ uh-huh the glipizide uh-huh and you have the blood pressure meds and you saw dermatology and they put you on some creams how's that doing it's doing okay okay and how's your back pain doing good good and what have you been doing are you working or no no are you doing any activity or like walking or any kind of exercise like walking or any kind of exercise you need to increase your activity okay like i said weight loss and exercise can help with your blood pressure and your diabetes okay and it's good for your heart i'm not saying go run marathons and no get yourself all worked up but you can do a half hour walk a day you know it's not much i know it's cold outside it's hard to go outside but go to a mall or someplace indoors or access to a pool or a gym you know i think that's gonna be the best medicine for you is to get yourself a little bit more activity every day okay um it's gonna help with everything it's going to help you breathe better and eventually you might be a little tired @@@ but if you do it in time you're gonna get better and better and i think in the end you could get off of some blood pressure medicines you could get off some of your diabetes medicines you know we can get you back in a healthy 43 year-old 46 year-old so this is something that you have to work on okay no one's going to help you do that any nausea or vomiting fevers or chills trouble urinating or having bowel movements no okay anything else that's been bothering you or specific questions that you have have you been checking your blood pressure at all no okay i want you to try doing it a couple times a week and maybe put it on a piece of paper and keeping track of it you better call us so we can see what your blood pressures are at home and we'll what they are in the clinic and if they're a little higher than they normally are and i see at home that your blood pressure is a more normal level again i can take you off some of your pills okay you could check one day in the morning and one day at night and one day at lunch then – it doesn’t have to be every day you know once in a while just keep the machine out where it’s easy to access and just jot it down for us like i said when you come in we really look at one number and we focus on that one number and it might be lower at home at well okay @@@ did you feel the earthquake today did you hear about it any trouble with your vision say ah @@@ over here @@@ some spots uh-huh @@@ are you using @@@ shampoo @@@ everything doing fine you smoking are you smoking how much uh-huh @@@ it's really bad for your lungs exercise and get in shape that includes smoking..@@@ okay no alcohol @@@ i know @@@ you know it's bad how about alcohol any other drug use heroin cocaine when was the last time you felt some chest pain shortness of breath how often are you getting that do you park or do you do the valet here did you have any trouble walking in here good now deep breath for me in and out any swelling in your legs @@@ anything concerning for you @@@ @@@ so um but it's just because we don't want you know having another i know but it's better than having a heart attack and dying to right um our cardiologists are very good so we want to see what they can do for you @@@ and like i said the best thing we can do is uh-huh @@@ you don't remember or feel anything no you're not completely out but you have anesthesia and on a breathing machine but you're pretty out of it uh-huh okay let me go talk to my attending to see if we can get the bloodwork now or wait a little bit longer since we don’t know when your angio will be if he does want it right now we might have to ask you to come back but we have a guy who can do it right now so we don’t have to stick you @@@ they only checked your coumadin level that's all they checked so give me one second i'll be right back okay okay so @@@ do the blood work right now @@@ um one thing he wanted me to talk to you about is um your sugars have been very well controlled and he really thinks that we could get away with just one of those diabetes medicines rather than two so i wanted to talk to you about if you were willing to try - how you feel about having just one of those medicines kind of limit the number of the pills that you're taking your sugar was pretty well controlled and your last a1c that we look at that averages the sugar it's pretty low and there are some studies saying that @@@ you don't want to drop them too low on the sugars so um what i would recommend is you're on the metformin and the glipizide we could stop the glipizide and increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day you're taking 500 twice a day right now and that might be enough to control your blood sugars would that be okay with you so would that be okay with you okay so i'm going to delete @@@ for you we're going to stop this medicine and we're going to increase this medicine and then @@@ we take another look at your sugars we get the average we recheck it and can see how it is and if we have to @@@ at that time hopefully you won't have to any questions or concerns about that no okay stay warm this winter okay i'm gonna see you in four months foll-up for you @@@ but call @@@ schedule the angio is that okay check that blood pressure once in a while and @@@ okay you got it okay you're gonna take a left and a right </doctor> <patient> well my dad

i've been taking two so i’ve been taking two pills a day hmm alright the only reason they put me on it is because i yeah right after the heart surgery probably about nine or ten months later they came in and said @@@ they put a stent in one they said the other one was too small to put a stent in and that's when they put me on the coumadin to kind of thin it out right right he put in the order yesterday okay uh @@@ yeah i take plavix @@@ took me off it no he said there really wasn't a really a big rush but he would like to hurry up and get it down but uh @@@ no well @@@ @@@ i do have uh

and do you take any medications for that or for any other reason ok yeah call me what is like flomax or or tamsulosin but there are there are others for sure ok yeah it's the brand name for it but

else that you wanted to mention or anything you were concerned about ok um so with your your symptoms today they do overlap potentially with covid and so what we'll need to do or will well it'll be important to do a swab to test for covid it could be something else like the common cold like another type of viral illness but because of the pandemic it will be important to self isolate including from your wife for the next 14 days and we'll get back to you with the results as soon as we can are you allergic to anything great date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ alright how are you @@@ alright how can i help you today well i know you did did you get a letter saying that to schedule this appointment or who scheduled it we saw you in january and i put it in that you know we probably didn't need to see you for another six months and that's in here i'm not sure who yeah uh-huh now when was this oh but i just saw you in january a couple months ago january 13th which hospital did you go to oh okay that's why it's not in here okay alright so did they increase your keppra dose your seizure medication did they increase that okay i can refill it so did they give you any like information after discharging you from there from being in the icu yeah so whenever you get admitted to other hospitals you should bring in the paperwork did you bring it in last time i saw you so who did you bring it in to we have nothing in here so what day exactly were you admitted to little company of mary 16th when were you discharged okay hmm alright well if you are able to get those the paperwork or your records from little company of mary just bring it to your appointment so i can actually take a look at it it's not in the computer so i'm not entirely sure when did you bring it because since the last time i saw you this is your next appointment you haven't been seen in between you just dropped off the paperwork okay well i mean i don't really know what to say it's just that it's not in the computer so i'm not really sure where it went okay that's fine uh-huh i'll refill it i'll fill the refills for you yeah your bad cholesterol is 110 so your ldl is 110 your good cholesterol which is your hdl is 78 78 so let me see you don't have any heart disease or diabetes so your cholesterol is fine we don't need to do anything with it perfect right oh so there's a form there's just two forms of cholesterol in our body so the bad one the ldl we want to get that lower usually uh and the good form we want it above 45 so it's um they just do different things to your arteries so the bad ones make your arteries harder yours is fine yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah you have to take that keppra so you missed a couple doses is that why is that why uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh appointment with neurology for follow-up okay yeah i would definitely address that no that's just because you have a large stomach doesn't mean you have liver disease your labs don't no your liver is fine i'm just looking at your labs and there's nothing wrong with your liver uh-huh for carpal tunnel i don't know yeah right um there's not really anything to prevent carpal tunnel um there are like splints that you can wear when you go to sleep but usually that's when people get carpal tunnel when we have them wear the splints um and then it keeps it from hurting so much um but really there isn't anything to you know people that sit at computers you know we tell them to rest their hand on something sometimes it's just not possible unless you change their job to something different yeah i mean it can't hurt you so you know not as far as i know a what feeling uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right okay okay yeah so that can happen after you've had a seizure it depends on the person it varies so uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh-huh i i'm not 100% sure; the epilepsy sure could cause memory problems um but uh the neurologist would probably have a better idea for the aspirin okay you were taking 81 okay uh-huh uh-huh yeah your labs all look fine yeah uh-huh yeah it's the same thing uh-huh @@@ prescription yeah right okay okay okay i don't know anything about insurance um probably the um i don't know where you'd go billing or means test yeah because i honestly i don't know about the insurance policies oh your weight's been pretty stable you know what i'm not worried about it if you were losing a ton of weight then i'd be worried about you not eating but hmm yeah i mean if you're not losing weight i wouldn't worry about it too much uh-huh so it's gotten better okay uh-huh oh okay yeah yeah this is different than hitting his head i believe so neurology no so strokes are when you don't get enough blood flow to the brain seizures are when um your brain fires signals kind of erratically so it is different yeah so you know when when we want to move our hand our brain sends signals to our arms and our hands and when you have a seizures all these signals are going off which is why people shake and have and people have different reactions to the seizures but because the brain is firing signals kind of erratically that's the way i can put it uh-huh i mean they may put it in the computer eventually um uh i mean i have no idea but i don't know where who has it or who rather did it but you know next time just bring it to the appointment so i see it and i can put it in my notes yeah you could get a copy of your medical records and then just bring it in when you get here i wouldn't drop it off again just bring it when you see me okay okay okay good um so i refilled your medications um do you want to pick them up or do you want them mailed to you alright so they'll be in the mail let me go talk to the supervising doctor real quick and i'll be right back they uh @@@ it's almost 3 we'll be done in time let me go talk to my supervising doctor alright you're good to go i put in the refills okay uh-huh yep it’s twice a day i think its daily that's what they had you on then that’s was fine it is twice a day it depends on whatever controls your seizures is right for you it's a pretty standard dose for people who have seizures you know i'm not between once a day and twice a day i'm not entirely sure the 500 mg is kind of where we start people off on and we test people on up to 1000 twice a day 1500 twice a day even so it just depends on what controls your seizures yeah okay so we'll see you back in a couple months then yep they'll send you a letter oh no problem </doctor> <patient> hey i've just been feeling kind of ill over the past two days and uh i thought i'd just come in to see what's going on so i've had um um i was feeling very achy and i had a cough and then i think yesterday night i developed a fever um i didn't but i'm pretty sure i have a fever and like i can feel it i had chills last night two days ago no it's kind of dry cough nothing no no it's a new cough a little bit yeah it's just like i can kind of like tell when i'm breathing like it just yeah it sounds different i don't know what a wheeze sounds like but it just sounds different uh uh sorry can you say that again uh no no no no uh yeah i kind of just foods have just been tasting little bland since yesterday no no uhm i uh i i've had that for a while like it's just i think my prostate's kind of large so it's it's hard for me to like i pee very frequently no i've been feeling a little tired no that's i think that covers it all no um just a large prostate it's not cancer or anything it's just kind of large yeah i think that's what the doctor said yeah i do i do take a i think a medication for that uhm it's called tamsulosin yeah i think i think it's called flomax nope nope i just live with wife in an apartment oh no she's feeling good i don't no i haven't i don't think so i mean potentially i was i was actually out with my friends but no one was sick nope i used to i quit i quit 10 years ago i used to smoke about two or three cigarettes a day for 20 years thanks nope no yeah maybe sometimes once or twice a month maybe a glass or two at a time uhm yeah i think it's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where people kind of die early people get like people in my family got heart attacks very early on in their 30s my brother died and when he was 15 oh yeah i see a cardiologist i get regular checkups done no sure thank you no i do not have any allergies right here well how are you i don't know man well you guys scheduled me for an appointment now yes you did i got a letter that say you know to call them for appointment i don't know but you know maybe it was because i had like a little incident that happened well you know i have you know epilepsy and then i had some seizures and they had to kind of be rushed to the hospital in fact intensive care a couple of days that was june or july 16th actually so that's probably good cause i wrote down a bunch of questions i've got actually january of what january right it was right after that little company of mary yeah cause i seen i talked to the billing department and all that stuff anyway but yeah that was actually that was good but otherwise @@@ so that probably worked out good anyway my what no they left it the same actually but i'm on my last bottle cause they sent this i just got this earlier today for the yeah yesterday as a matter of fact and they was telling me what's gonna be coming up in the future but it didn't have this on there that's the main one i need yeah that's good; out of all of them that's the most important one yeah well you know just you know you check in with the va and stuff oh i did as a matter of fact i did bring it yes i am glad you said i did bring it in cause i at the time i was still kind of recovering myself and i brought in some paperwork no it was after that i gave it to the d clinic i mean the red clinic here they said yeah okay we'll take it and put it in your file or something cause i was gonna ask if i could get a copy of it actually cause i didn't you know i wasn't even thinking about that cause yeah cause i sure brought it in to them and i should have kept a copy of it myself but at that time i was still coming back to my own you know senses um january 16th the 18th uh-huh i mean it’s here now somewhere i mean you know i gave it to the personnel that was at the desk which the person i don’t recall now you know but i certainly handed it in cause they said to be sure to hand it in that's why i made it a point to bring it so i know i just dropped off the paperwork cause i had to go yeah because i went up to the billing to find out you know cause they saying you know they'd take care of the cost of it so i actually went up to the billing and i dropped that off as well i don't know what to say either but i know i brought it here okay but anyway i did have cause after that happened i was pretty scared actually yeah so let's see oh yeah the pill thing we talked about that for the seizures yeah cause i'm like on the last bottle yeah and then uh i have to come oh that was the thing what it was too i had to come to get a cholesterol test i did that also and i wanted to see what my cholesterol level was cause i've been having blood @@@ 110 the good is what okay now what exactly does that mean okay so then so no problems with that okay good 100 bad and good what does that mean bad and good exactly i didn't really understood that oh okay right hard right so mine's pretty good okay now okay well now some of this i was writing stuff like i said write stuff but by the time you come for your appointment then you forget a lot of stuff so it's really not as much as it looks like here on this paper now let's see like fasting stuff you know like i guess i'm trying to you know really try to come to terms with this epilepsy thing so i know that’s pretty life-changing for me,so like i said now at the most i have five seizures in a row they had to call like the ambulance yeah you know i do admit to not taking the medication the way i should have well you say yeah yeah that's the only thing i could figure out you know but i don't have any memories or anything i have memories waking up in the hospital so but since that time what's happening whether i eat or not then kind of like these semi-constant mild headaches you know like even now they just never seem to go away and i find myself taking like maybe between four and six aspirin you know daily you know so i'm like i got an appointment yeah yeah and they don't just seem to want to leave so uh and then i guess now how i think somebody was telling me this it was a friend of mine said i don't know it looks like @@@ and on your liver you got liver disease or some stuck that's when i says let me write that down too @@@ right right cause i say cause your skin you took with your stomach so that mean there must be something going with your liver or something no okay that's good good good good okay now okay doc i got this no i just you know i need some advice i’m working at the heritage you know with their @@@ so we know that puts a lot of you know kind of i don't know if it’s that carpal tunnel stuff now what is you could kind of do for it i mean me you know it's like some kind of exercises well to prevent i guess say i don't think i got it but i don't want to get it either cause sometime you know you get this kind of sore right in this area you know come all the way here and bend it @@@ in the process uh-huh right uh-huh right right right so the doctor gives them something where they squeeze like a tennis ball cause i don't know if that would even do nothing first thing but do it help it yeah right okay and let's see okay this thing i got this thing and i guess i hadn't even thought about it something i just read maybe i save this till the last week but it seems like my heart has a real like kind of a @@@ feeling you know like labored,maybe i guess i don't know i guess that's the only term i can use to describe it it's a pain like you just saying you know how it usually pump the blood now you @@@ i don't want to say like strain or nothing but it just it didn’t seem @@@ feel okay you know the @@@ is up but a lot of them have to do with rebounding back from the you know the little incident i had so i feel like i'm doing okay now so and you know i guess you know maybe @@@ especially first just feeling real tired you know yes i understand like back-to-back you know so but yeah but that seem to be coming out okay i guess i figured it would probably take three of four months to come back to normal yeah yeah that’s true now this is one of the things i mean like i like @@@ for this too this what i really find is kind of concerning me is uh i been having like you know the memory loss short term and like long term memory loss like what i did a perfect example like yesterday i was on the train you know and ran into my you know i know this person “oh yeah how you doing?” i know him good but i don't know where i know him from you know what i mean and “don't you remember name?” well no i really don't remember actually you @@@ stuff that i probably should be able to but i don't seem to be able to do that so that's like short term stuff and long term stuff that's the kind you know bug me a little bit you know yes yeah probably @@@ yeah cause like i say i want to lose the weight and regain that thing oh yeah and here's one too on the refills i noticed on that they were gonna send me the aspirin and there was that's not on there either i supposed to had got it restarted sending i think on day one or two and then that's what it said and it said no more refills on it so uh-huh yeah cause when i call in and they said well maybe i can @@@ and so they called me over they said like no more refills got to see the doctor on that and actually i just restarted it back up cause that was one thing plus the thing for seizure okay @@@ you get all like your lab results in here so you know you say the cholesterol's good no problem with the liver and none of that and then i took a tb test not long ago i guess that was good okay so the next appointment i got to worry about that okay also now you know after i got the you know the script for the levitra or vardenafil and then when i was at the walmart hell they got the generic version of that you know the same thing and i was saying i wonder if that would be just as good as the regular stuff i know it sure is a lot less expensive yeah good cause i went to price it at osco they were like $120 some bucks i mean at walmart $54 that's less than half the amount so if it's still the same or just as good huh okay good i got a eye appointment coming up in may but uh like for me i'm farsighted i just need glasses and the last appointment like 200 you know so i @@@ for me cause i only wear them to read you know so that's why i already told them they got like reading glasses at the dollar store and all that and they just as good so i didn't know it was $5 i never really wear any except for to read so guess so i you know just as long as you get the correct okay so we're gonna do hmm got that oh okay now here's one now i got another question so let's just sign off you know for a while you know aarp card being over 50 and they got like the insurance plan that so i say well i'll check with you guys say like i get the supplemental insurance and the reason being cause this that you got i see all these @@@ my eyes all the extra eyes all big under there you know i'd like the @@@ the other day and i'd rather come here so it's not you know nothing to do with military related i mean you know you do that but that was a while ago when i asked that so i don't know if they changed the procedure oh who would know who do i talk to about that maybe the billing well i got to go to billing anyway okay let's see is that everything yes sir they wrote me and that's where they said come on in now there is something else you know i been you know on this side i'm barely able to eat i don't really eat a lot one time i might go like the whole 24 hour period without really eating much and uh if i'm running behind and i'm like well i say do i need to like kind of i don't know i don’t know how to explain this exactly yes it stays pretty stable by and large you know yeah you know doctors don't like the whole 24 hour i might eat something like i eat something in the morning it might be the next morning by the time that i might eat something again you know you know i'm like well i make sure it ain't no cause for concern or anything i know everybody's body is different you know i don't seem to be okay let's see oh this thing is kind of the size @@@ for a while i was having like nausea or stuff it's all gone after that episode you know with the so yeah it's like you say i never even thought about it till i just read it but i’d say that this was maybe up to last week or something okay cross that one off okay oh yeah now here's the other thing and i know with the you know with me with this epilepsy you know trying to come to grips with that thing and i know it can take a toll on the brain and stuff and you know the chicago bears dude just died they probably got a cte or something i don't know whether he got it from too many collisions to the head or something damaged his brain and i saying well maybe about me like i say with this constant headache such that even now it never really leaves just sometimes it’s maybe more you know more hurtful or painful at other times but it never leaves yeah yeah that's true but i guess like you know having the seizures now it's got to be something with the right that's it you know what i mean and then uh seizures is those like you know kind of like mini-strokes or something is that what that is okay yeah okay fires signals erratically yeah i know right okay okay that would be something to go with the neurology or something okay oh yeah and then i had a thing with that paperwork so i don't know i'm fine i mean after i turned it in right into the desk i mean it got to be somewhere eventually yeah yeah well i actually like if i go i'll probably go over to the hospital they probably got it they probably give me a copy of it uh-huh or what about when i come for my neurology appointment okay oh this is when i brought it in i got it wrote down i brought it in on january 24th so that was like what maybe like a couple weeks ago i don't know i know i just dropped it off and um i guess that sums it up actually okay uh just you can mail them all i

let's make sure when you put it that way right so that's like 1000 mg per day is that a high amount well yeah i understand that i understand that but i'm just saying that i'm just saying in general is that considered to be a large dosage but being once a day mostly uh-huh right yeah absolutely i said well i don't know if that's what it was but you know mild or normal or what kind of thing so well

did you bring in your uh your and you're getting mad at me you're getting mad at me and you forgot it which you knew i was gonna ask about it you did alright let’s see uh-huh oh hmm i'm sorry i got late it's not my fault yeah i never i never have meetings not even for the clinic no the computer is i'm not going to bore you with the details but anyway so let's see so your labs you got in october your your lipids are okay they're a little bit high for my taste but just a little bit high so your blood sugar was high you did let's see today you are 230 pounds look at you you lost four pounds! nice job how'd you do it give me some lessons sitting around good for you um let's see what else last time you came in you were having some left ankle pain shooting pain in both your toes and hands especially on the right side still have it gabapentin okay well what dose are you on we can increase it we can increase it even more than that that's what you're supposed to do with that medicine you're supposed to increase it until it starts helping cause the pain you have is called it seems like the way you describe it the kind of the way you're describing like shooting pain it sounds like what we call neuropathic pain and that can happen in patients with diabetes and can be perfectly controlled nothing is your fault i'm just saying why it happens you can interpret that however you like nope how long ago was this and that's not attractive let's see yeah yeah (laughter) no i'll keep seeing you even when your toes look funky oh no there's more when was this august you need to go see podiatry again uh-huh with your surgery ever since they did @@@ and ortho did that to you right i'm gonna have you see podiatry again you have avulsion is it cold i'm going to alright let's see what else you've got i see you had some lower extremity swelling last time the last time you came in lower extremity your legs were swelling up still happening or hmm yeah are you still using your um what's it called our ted hose they gave you some like some stockings so yes or no okay yeah how long has your foot been this color okay since the accident but it hasn't changed right when was the accident this year right 08 hmm no so let me finish this and i'll examine your feet okay um you got all your meds you need any refills everything that's refillable your blood pressure's pretty good today well let's see cause it depends like my blood pressure is usually 80/50 last time you came 96/58 you were 109/67 last time so not bad 116 did they start a new need blood pressure medicine on you no your blood pressure's been fine you're not taking that blood pressure so what medications are you taking but do you know how many blood pressure medicines you're taking just one lisinopril okay oh that's fine that's the only one you're actually prescribed on here alright i'm going to refill your meds then we'll look at you gabapentin and i'm going to increase it so right now you're taking 300 mg three times a day that's okay @@@ your aspirin alcohol prep pads simvastatin multivitamin niacin lisinopril metformin you need lancets too you need more of your vardenafil vardenafil the um viagra probably because you're out of refills i'll put one in for you um you want these mailed to you or do you want to pick them up here do you want to pick them up here or do you want them mailed to your house okay uh-huh alright i'll see what i can do i'll see what i can do yeah uh-huh yeah what about um your glucose strips do you need more of those needles lancets syringes do you use the 0.5 ml or the 1 ml syringes so there's two different kinds of syringes one you can fill up half a milliliter and one you can fill up one milliliter okay it goes 60 70 80 90 100 i think that's the 1 milliliter what do you need the vicodin for which pain in your foot cause that is not indicated for the kind of pain you're having uh-huh i'll ask her what she thinks but you know i don't usually give it out that's something i agree @@@ practicing medicines october uh-huh how often are you using them so like one every other day two every other day uh-huh um tell me about your blood sugars at home are you checking them tell me what they read when you check them under 200 is good it's not good in what sense they shouldn't be up in the 150s 160s that's not good i know you are i know you are so we need to have you have you seen the eye doctors we need to have you see the eye doctor you're not really a prescription for now on because people with diabetes have risks for eye problems so we just like you to see the eye doctor once a year okay so we need to schedule an appointment for the eye doctor um you should just be able to schedule it when you go up front cause you've seen them here before right um and then the other thing you were supposed to see the liver doctors did you ever see them okay they can do that for you up front too and i think you're gonna end up having to see the diabetic the pharmacy because of your diabetes your hemoglobin is too high and uh uh-huh when was the last time you saw her yeah coumadin yep uh-huh uh-huh yeah well you're gonna have to see her about uh because we need to get your diabetes under control so i'm probably gonna have you we might change your meds around a little bit because are you taking your meds religiously every day and that's @@@ you're taking every day without fail right so we probably have to increase it is the problem cause you're not getting good blood sugar when you lose a whole bunch of weight diet pills are not safe nor are they healthy and i would never prescribe them they are really bad for you i get it i never said i'd never prescribe @@@ i work out five times a week i really work at it @@@ you will be motivated to keep working out (laughter) you gotta show off with right so yeah cause it hurts or okay let me see you let me examine you and we'll do your feet last okay nope not yet actually take off your sweatshirt (laughter) oh that's what you come to the doctor for (laughter) give me some deep breaths in and out through your mouth @@@ that's okay you'll get it back now breathe normal any shortness of breath trouble breathing chest pain anything like that right no trouble breathing or anything like that uh-huh so you're feeling like not doing anything are you just tired yeah you can lay your stuff down @@@ you did getting underneath @@@ (laughter) pancreatitis have you been drinking a lot of alcohol well when you had the pancreatitis did they ever tell you what caused it @@@ uh-huh uh-huh well understandable but you know we have to do what’s best for you @@@ came here uh-huh yeah that's what happens when you have pancreatitis you having that problem again go ahead and sit up for me alright so you felt better after you threw up okay hi where is your sugar log told you she'd ask you oh i was supposed to lie to her (laughter) make it on the 4th i think i will be back by then so we can check your sugars and adjust your insulin then no you don't need any blood tests i'm talking about you checking your sugars at home the different times of the day and do you have those sheets or you want me to give you new ones okay so that we can have at least three or four readings of each column no one time a day but switch the times each day so uh see your glycosylated is 8.5 which is bad then you have problems with your feet and so forth and your neuropathy is never going to get better if your diabetes stays like this no that's part of neuropathy and it's from your diabetes as long as your diabetes continues to be doing poorly it will only get worse okay but if you get it controlled it may actually get better but if we don't do anything no matter how many medicines i give you it's not going to be better it's linked if your diabetes is not controlled this is going to get worse well that's good you do diet you do exercise you do your insulin those are all the things that will control it just not increasing the medicine will help you in terms of your insulin so you really need to do all of the things similarly but at the same time you need to check your sugar so that it @@@ you where you are and if it goes up then we can adjust your medications but in terms of vicodin that's the other pain medication so that would not be the medicine for your diabetic neuropathy good so it's a neuropathy medication okay so we'll increase that i can give you like 15-30 pills with no refills and this is not for the neuropathy pain it’s for the ankle pain if you need it but no refills i don't want to get in the habit of taking vicodin for regular pain yeah then what i'm saying for the medicine that is not for this and i don't want you to i will issue the pain medication okay next week nowhere yeah take care happy holidays take care alright @@@ i have been trying i have all these records i've got to go through she asked me what your blood sugar was and i said you didn't bring it @@@ you know i do what i can to set you up that's my bad alright so here's what we're gonna do i know she is pretty awesome she is pretty awesome i know because she cares about you alright so here's what we're gonna do you already have some appointments coming up you've got on january 12th you've got your liver appointment the 4th is with podiatry the 4th you've got podiatry and i want you to have them schedule you for a diabetic pharm d on january 4th as well uh-huh so ask them to do that up front and bring your labs or your logs um we need to reschedule your orthopedic appointment because you missed it on december 4th no that's okay right well they can make it for you right you can have them reschedule that for you up front so we'll reschedule your ortho appointment we'll schedule your eye doctor ophthalmology for the eye doctor orthopedics um diabetes with the pharm dy and now for your uh pain in your eye they're increasing your gabapentin to 800 mg three times a day you know you already have them and i mean you can do that way this time um well i'll give you the 900 three times a day um then the other thing is we want to get some imaging; basically it's called arterial blood study in your lower extremities of your legs um because we're worried about some of this might arterial as well as the pain you're describing so your arteries are the blood vessels that take blood into the body uh-huh uh-huh well what we'll do is we'll have them do that for you so that we can make sure that your arteries are doing okay okay no no only some of the @@@ you know was due to the injury that you had and what not so let's uh-huh well let's get this done then we'll have an explanation okay and i'll see you back in three months how does that sound ha ha ha you can try to schedule with her if you want really how early do you want @@@ you can always schedule @@@ i mean i don't think you need to see me every month and a half because you don't have that many medical problems for you to if you want to see me every month and half so that's not gonna happen by you seeing me more often though yeah but you see the thing is your labs right now that you've been getting like your a1c which shows up your um your blood sugar over what the average over a three month period is high it should be less than 7 high i know its better well it used to be but that just mean you know we need to keep working at it the only way you're gonna come off of your medications is to lose more weight the insulin and so the only way this is gonna work is the only way you can get your blood sugar where it's at goal is by using a log and the only way you can end up requiring less medications is to lose more weight well we can't check this laboratory more than every three months anyway this lab it gives you an average of your blood sugars for three months for a three month period so we wouldn't check it more than every three months does that make sense you can come and see me more often if you want i just don't think it's going to change our management of you okay if you want to you're more than welcome to call and schedule something more often if you feel more comfortable then absolutely you can come more often as you like good uh-huh uh-huh yeah have you thought about seeing a psychiatrist @@@ sometimes @@@ you can see them @@@ i mean they're doctors too you know he was a psychologist psychologist psychiatrists are doctors psychologists don’t have mds they can talk to you they can kind of help you work through things yeah but they have a lot more alright so you don't have to do it it's just an option i like to offer to people cause a lot of guys here 20 years i know i know she was you are you call in and you have this number because you’ve been here forever right yep so you call in and ask for an appointment with me as soon as you want okay push down @@@ yeah but just call and schedule cause if it's not on a monday you've got to call and schedule anyway so it is yeah okay alright i'll see you back when you come and see me happy holidays have a good christmas and new year's and i'll see you back in a little bit alright take care and bring your blood sugars along next time alright </doctor> <patient> yes hey you're late i don't care i don't no no double no yes yeah so how have you been doing i've been i'm doing good no you know i forgot it yes i knew exactly what it was when i got in the van this morning i went oh but i did blood work in be you know so check it out from that point if i had saw you this morning i was gonna say why don't you put a prescription in for me to get my blood work and then we'll both know how accurate yeah i thought you were in a meeting but it was the nurses that were in a meeting you never have meetings you just like to be late right right right right uh-huh i've lost weight yeah look at it 230 pounds before i was hey push away from the table and eat smaller portions yeah that's it but do you have anything stronger well i did because uh its 300 mg i think and i'm taking two each time okay yes right so you're saying it's all my fault did i show you what happened to my toes now podiatry podiatry actually was doing their thing and i told them i said my toes have been bothering me so i said do i have gout or something but he said no but when he cut my toenails he did it like that everywhere but since then the toenail has come off toenails been off now uh wait a minute @@@ so you remember uh boomerang with eddie murphy you remember when he pulled the tassels off the different toes well you gonna kick me out there is that how you're gonna treat me no you gonna keep me wait a minute wait a minute not just my toe there's more this happened uh uh now that one looks a lot better but you know what this toe doesn't okay look here i can bend that ever since the surgery i'm not getting the range in it yeah and i think i want them to take these pins out yeah i want them to take now they took seven out on that side but see look at my skin what's going on with that now look at here but uh yeah but that's what they dark it looks dead or something no but sometimes it feels frozen but it's not cold so grow another foot alright sure alright no we did the ultrasound you know what i think it was @@@ what the stockings that thing was that was murder getting the thing on and off just like that's what i mean now before i had the accident i could put them on and i could deal with it once they're on their fine but when you try and put them bad boys on oh since the accident it hasn't changed i mean it's like you would think by now i would get color in my you know uh april 23rd of 08 yeah and also does that toe look lose or something i need refills everything that's refillable please refill it yes i thought that was kind of low cause normally i have excellent blood pressure oh see now mine was 117 over 80 that was 90 no you know i think she was trying that one blood pressure medicine and that's the one i had the reaction and she said take it in half i’ll be honest @@@ you know what i'm so used to them all @@@ one yeah if you name it i can tell you yep yeah let's see what all you gonna refill okay i'm just resting that's good @@@ okay yes yes lancets yes which one they haven't sent that to me in like three months i want the macho dose i want them right through the roof mail them to me now wait a minute what was that movie with chris rock in it uh i love my wife and he took it and then they called the ambulance only they had to suit him and stuff that's the way i want to be like that man something crazy makes me filled with love cause i'm not satisfied with the way he's been acting he's really been letting me down yeah it's like you know i can be pumped up and everything and as soon as he gets there he says it's dark in here i'm coming out you know and he's i mean he not only goes into his shell i'm like dude come on i need you man don't let me down now i been you know yes needles yes what do you mean what do you mean 10 20 30 40 50 60 that's right which one is that cause it helps me with my pain with the pain that i have yes i understand that she knows that she knows that right when was the last time i was seen here in october okay she gave me 30 pills then i still have like 9 but i was just saying i don't want to run out as needed i don't take them daily one every other maybe once monday maybe thursday then again maybe next tuesday or whenever that pain it just really gives me the flux not not like you know i've been under 200 no no no wait a minute now i think my highest is like 208 i haven't been keeping those records and i'm i need to i'm telling you when i check my sugars my sugars have been good but i'm hard-headed you know that not in a while wait a minute these are new glasses here i'm not going to get me a new prescription unless they gonna pay for them yeah put it in there yes they're the only ones that i've seen for my eyes you know what i cancelled that appointment i think that was the day we buried my grandfather and i had to cancel that appointment and i didn't make a new one that's like when i had the blood clot in my groin and they had me on the uh heparin and coumadin i was doing two shots a day the coumadin i was here every other day i mean they had a track going checking my stuff out yes why yeah 85 in the morning 65 in the evening and every now and then yes every now and then i bump it or you decrease it but i yeah man when am i gonna not be a diabetic well help me out; give me a diet pill or something but you got a lot of medicines that you won't prescribe come on help me out look at you you all slim and trim how do you do it get me in that or whatever you doing look help me work out (laughter) uh i'm gonna work that'll just slow me down but i'll be like hmm she’s fine but wait a minute you know what if i take off see that's what like now i can't be barefooted yeah it kills me @@@ oh do i take off my shoes i'm @@@ dress shirt (laughter) yes all the doctors are ladies i can't @@@ i can't @@@ see that's what @@@ yeah shoot actually you know what the last couple of days i've been feeling like not doing nothing and it's like i i don't have i don't have motivation @@@ yeah @@@ just falling asleep yeah yeah yeah i got some @@@ @@@ here you see over here it's just kind of yeah i don't have california feet you know what i was telling you i was telling the nurse that i you know the last thing @@@ pancreatitis i been having that problem lately i don't drink alcohol i mean i'll have a cocktail but i haven't have nothing like that to drink i don't you know they went down just through my throat twice and i was not a happy camper i know but if i can't eat in the evening and then just after twelve o’clock but she didn’t want me on nothin i’m talking about broth with breakfast lunch and dinner i went crazy well i think i've had three times when i threw up one time i'm like whoa i finished my breakfast and everything i had just come out and i was fine yeah yeah you were supposed to tell her that well you can no no not lie but just tell her so she wouldn't come cause she jumps she hits me okay so you want me to draw the blood today or what i have those @@@ so you want me to do it three times a day oh okay and i'm trying to lose the weight cause i know that no but it helps @@@ sleepy that doesn’t bother me no no and like i told her i still have a few pills from the last time you gave me some alright so now you supposed to be going over on vacation this year where you going you’re just going to relax @@@ bye what'd she ask you now you probably said he didn't bring it you been had i know you telling me setting me up she didn't say where where you log at she always gets me she's been doing that since 2000 you know that well i swear by her every time i i can call her from home she says okay you come in to the clinic i'll be waiting here and i go pop and i get here and she say @@@ and she treats you like a little kid just drag me down the hall and next thing i know i’m in the emergency room and i'm admitted to the hospital yes she does i thought that was on the 4th she said she just said podiatry and what else but you know what i knew there was something that i needed to do i knew it but i thought i scheduled it for today because i knew i was going to be here early and they're there on mondays and fridays only so i knew it okay i need to reschedule with ortho i thought she said 900 arterial means that's what i'm wondering you know because right after the surgery it was you know just before i blacked out in surgery i remember seeing my feet go up and the way they tied the toes to hang that foot up there for them to do i'm like please thank you cause i'm hurting here i mean like here okay the whole foot used to look like that and actually do a lotion a lotion to put the sock on and it takes it right off and we just that'll be fine no i want to see you before yeah @@@ in three months i'll forget something you know and i figure if i what about why can't we go every month and a half instead of three months why @@@ you know what yes i do because i want to get i want to get cut down on insulin yes it will because i'll be bringing in my readings and you'll be telling me about those others well what should that be 8.5 that's nothing it used to be 13 or higher so come on you just you want jack with me (laughter) now what medication am i taking for the diabetes i'm trying to do that but now but the reason i was saying if i come in every month and a half then i could draw some blood and i'll feel better knowing that after which i'll know where i'm at i think it will it's like i'm being monitored you know i feel more comfortable i feel comfortable knowing that i'm being monitored properly and that yes i am doing the right thing and i'm 51; i want to see 61 71 81 91 i want to keep going i want to keep you know feeling like i'm feeling right now you know i want to have motivation some day and it's not because of my diabetes; i don't know what it is like yesterday i felt like @@@ only because i don't think it's that bad i

<doctor> good afternoon ma'am how long have you and your husband been married i assume you live together what do you do for a living that's wonderful do you drink or smoke good for you date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ it is we need to go down this way @@@ is it raining outside little bit well it's clearing up oh yeah how are things going yeah good good some refills yep sure let's take a look uh-huh okay right uh-huh uh-huh yep yep uh-huh uh-huh right and that is something that it causes normally but your potassium even with the supplement is low so we're watching that we have our eye out for it but we if your potassium drops too low it's bad for your heart so we have to keep an eye on it so we do check it with every lab we do with you but so far this is working so we're gonna stay on it good that's fine just don't eat like 12 yeah cause that would be bad yeah a banana every day is perfect and then what else is going on the aspirin you're taking low dose do you get it through us do you want to i don't know what the cost difference would be but we could try if you want i can write this for you and i can write the multivitamin for you or do you prefer to get them yourself okay that's fine okay okay do you want to pick it up downstairs or do you want us to mail to you okay let's do that now so we don't forget now what's the dose you're taking now do you take 40 okay you want 90-day supply wonderful yeah i was just looking at that before you walked in so your cholesterol your total cholesterol is 195 uh your good cholesterol is 50 so that's really good and we want it above 40 so diet exercise that kind of stuff and then your ldl is 103 and you're not a diabetic and so a man your age with high blood pressure should be below 100 cause you're right at that cusp at 100 so i mean we're kind of sitting where we need to at this point so it's good okay um and then i was looking at your other labs so your potassium like i told you it's even on like the low end of normal even with the supplement so we're okay with staying with what we're doing the kidney function is good your fasting glucose was really good that means you're not like pre-diabetic or anything like that yes it was 95 yes yes and then um and then i checked your liver enzymes cause people that are on statin for a long time you just want to monitor to see how the liver is doing and those are totally normal um and then oh yeah yeah damage your liver yeah no so those are perfect uh-huh oh good good and we're done with that right you're done with the whole okay good good and then we also checked your what we call a cbc which is like the white blood cell count the hemoglobin and your platelets and those are all normal so we don't have to worry about anemia or anything like that yeah so your triglycerides are pretty high but we want you around 150 and you're at 200 um have you ever taken like niacin yeah yeah but niacin itself is probably a little bit stronger we can try niacin and see how you respond to it and recheck them in like three months um a lot of it is genetics and then some of its diet so you know a high fat diet can cause you to have a lot of triglycerides yeah yeah sometimes it's genetic so kind of take care of it alcohol can absolutely let me see where they were before yeah i mean you were at 219 before you're 209 now you've always been around 200 so i'm guessing it's more of a yeah it's more of a genetic component cause your diet seems like it's pretty good from the last time we talked so good so yeah i mean you can try niacin i can give it to you through the va is this a b vitamin and the side effects of that is some people get flushing like they just feel very hot and red and then the answer to that would be a slow-release niacin you know a slower acting for your systems kind of a tablet that's slower do you want to try it okay let's go ahead and do that and then we'll recheck everything in a couple of months 90-day supply see how you tolerate it i'd say about maybe 15% of people have that reaction so hopefully you won't okay um and what about your other medicines the cholesterol pill okay okay we'll do that and then i'll give you enough refills how's your blood pressure been doing in the last year uh-huh yeah yeah this number is really good yeah oh really do you want a different um monitor i can order you one from the va i don't think it costs very much at all and you just pick it up downstairs in the prosthetics department on your way out do you want that it's definitely less than that i feel the wrist ones can be pretty inaccurate yeah so i mean you can go pick up one at walgreens i prefer you get the cuff or i can order one through the va which is probably cheaper for you i'm not exactly sure how much they charge but when you go pick it up you can ask them and if you don't want it then don't take it do you want to do that at least okay yeah doesn’t seem reliable yes the potassium needed some refills too this was followed up in november you were just taking potassium and chloride okay so we also this time around checked your prostate to see what your prostate hormone was doing and it's a little bit elevated has anyone ever told you that before okay cause i know you let's see you started following here at the va a couple of years ago or was it how long ago two years okay no one's ever checked here at the va so i don't know what your records were on the outside um but it's a little bit elevated so it's a little concerning it could be many different things and most likely it's probably the gland itself just gets bigger as you age um and that's what most people you know end up having a high psa it can also be if it's really really high it can also be prostate cancer um but yours isn't to that level at this point but i still want to keep an eye on it and probably send you to see the urology doctors okay just for them to kind of keep an eye on things to watch it a little bit closer are you having any urinary symptoms at home like when you wake up at night and have to go to the bathroom uh-huh okay yeah since it's a diuretic right right okay get up if you take it in the morning how often do you get up at night to go to the bathroom you don't have to get up do you ever have to um kind of go to the bathroom multiple times in a row to empty your bladder fully okay do you ever feel like it takes a while for you to start a urine stream or it just won't come out okay okay so yeah we'll just you know we'll have you go to the urology doctors and have them kind of take a look at it okay it's a good thing to catch early for sure in case anything is going on yeah uh-huh like a prescription uh okay yeah what happened there oh okay yeah yeah okay okay okay okay uh-huh isn't helping either when did you last see her okay and that's when she gave you the last cream and that's not working yeah but it's not working how long did you try it before you kind of okay yeah that's a good try so you're supposed to go back and seen them in june june 11th it looks like okay no it's july july 11th do you want to see if we can get you in earlier is it really bothering you or are you just kind of okay uh-huh you can't seem to get it under control huh yeah so you're like what's going on yeah i'll let them deal with that department since i usually don't do that out yeah yeah maybe that's why yeah yeah definitely it's not made to be outside the mouth so yeah well it looks great; it looks really good though you know as you said it was a pretty big mass yeah alright yeah where was that done uh-huh was it at hines okay uh and then your ears how's that going you're following with audiology perfect perfect oh good that's good alright okay i was just putting in your urology referral for you to go see them okay anything else going on how's your weight been doing are you up down okay uh-huh you gained it all back huh yeah it looks like you were yeah about this time last year you were about the same around like 190 yeah yeah they have um they have different programs here you know for like exercise and new programs like the move program where they kind of teach you different exercise things to do and also like diet if you're interested i mean its more trips to the va if you can and if not i mean okay that's fine yeah good for you good good good uh good anything else going on okay good wonderful let's have you sit up there i'll listen to your @@@ take a deep breath for me take a deep breath for me good a couple more like that good and how have your bowels been are you regular okay no blood in the stool or any dark stool or anything like that i'm going to take a look at your legs you haven't noticed any more swelling than usual eczema yeah down here looks a little @@@ here oh yeah yeah do you scratch it pretty bad yes yeah do you have it on your chest too do you put that cream that they gave you okay does that work stops the itching at least okay wonderful alright just give me a couple of minutes; i'll be right back okay i want to check real quick are we up-to-date on your um colonoscopy yeah okay i just want to make sure your vaccines are up-to-date okay yeah that's right so you're all done alright have a seat right there i'll be right back okay sir you're all set so the blood pressure cuff is free so you could just go to prosthetics and pick it up my nurse can point you in the right direction @@@ @@@ follow me uh is there any way you can give us a urine sample okay right over here we just need a little urine sample before you go see the urology doctor and we want to get it so i'm going to have you just take @@@ they'll do it here instead of sending you back to the lab then after that they'll set you up to come back and see me in about six months okay they'll do that go over here and have a seat okay i'll see you later sir okay take care now </doctor> <patient> good afternoon doctor oh at this point i don't even know how long its been yes we do i'm a school nurse for the school department i love working with the children no i don't drink and i quit smoking cigarettes about twenty five years ago fine fine better uh it was a little bit yeah uh-huh it's going to come later uh-huh uh fine uh no complaints i'm feeling very well uh i need uh some refills yeah and i brought a list of my medications and i have one question on one of them i'm uh you know daily on the lovastatin triamterene and the potassium supplements however when my prescription comes they have a warning for people who take triamterene uh saying that it can raise your body's potassium level and do not use potassium supplements if you're taking triamterene okay okay okay yeah uh i and i eat a banana every day @@@ uh okay uh no uh i can get them myself uh i will need the lovastatin renewed because i have about ten tablets let um you can send it in the mail uh the lovastatin 40 mg a 90-day supply yeah uh but my cholesterol is in good shape right right uh-huh right uh-huh right every time it's been tested it's at 90 so so what did it do this time 95 uh-huh and then uh last year i took the uh oral anti-fungal for 90 days so there was concern that that would uh …danage the liver yeah uh that resulted in all the toenails look perfect right right uh-huh right but before i had high levels of triglycerides is that uh well i take a multivitamin and that has niacin in it what causes the triglycerides to be so high i'm on a low fat diet uh but alcohol would elevate it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i'll try that uh-huh uh-huh uh my potassium supplement i got a 60-day supply left and no refills so maybe i need it uh it's been fine i have uh a device i use on my wrist to measure it but uh it gives me fairly high readings and the device is inaccurate uh when they tested the blood pressure i was about 112/72 which is i'm getting 145/90 when i test at home how much is that gonna cost uh-huh i bought this thing and i paid 90 some dollars for it i think so uh-huh right right right i'll try that alright because i repeat the tests on the wrist and a couple of minutes later the figure is all different it's a general estimation though uh-huh uh no uh it's almost two years uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay okay uh i've had uh you know frequent and urgent urination for a long time uh i think probably it's due to the blood pressure medication it's a diuretic uh i take the blood pressure medications in the morning not at night if i take it at night i have to get up in the night uh i don't have to get up at night not really no no no yeah yeah and i also see a dermatologist she's very good uh she has tried to do something for my lip uh the first that she wanted me to try is a 2.5% cream it really has no effect my lip won't heal uh i had surgery to remove a very large growth under my left the one on my back of my neck was basal cell carcinoma this one was like a large tumor due to sun damage but it was not basal cell uh it's never healed properly and my lip was numb and for eight years the skin peeled off my lips every other day uh she wanted me to try this one and i haven't been back to talk to her since she wanted me to try but this doesn't do anything no uh i saw her um maybe three or four months ago she gave me the last one yeah she said to see if it would work uh i still have plenty of it left i stopped taking it uh i used it for uh almost two months uh-huh uh-huh right uh it doesn't really bother me but uh it's slightly sore and the skin peels off of it every other day it's been doing that for eight years well during the surgery they pulled the skin from the inside of my mouth to form a lip and that skin it cannot be exposed it has something to do with it right uh it was very large under my lip and they did two surgeries and at the first surgery uh it was done by a plastic surgeon uh no rush oak park uh yes the hearing aids are working very well i have a device for the telephone also so i'm now able to hear on the phone calls uh-huh uh not that i can think of i'm probably gaining a little weight uh after i left the hospital i lost 10 pounds but now i've gained it all back again i went down to 180 uh-huh right uh that's really too heavy for hmm no because i can really do everything on my own i’m trying follow the best possible diet low fat high fiber and i'm getting good exercise i don't drive so i'm walking like every day uh not that i can think of uh fine uh-huh no no uh not really i get eczema you can pull my socks down and i'll show you where it's at yeah @@@ and @@@ almost eczema uh yes uh but the eczema season is almost over on my low chest uh i use the hydrocortisone uh yes it does yeah

hours you should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates or family members for the next so 14 days since you first experienced the the cough based on like public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions and if it can be anything else too like with a cough there can be multiple things going on you can have um like an upper respiratory viral or bacterial infection but since you're not having too many other symptoms right now it can just be bronchitis um this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like uh pneumonia for example but right now yeah we'll get that testing done and then just kind of wait and watch you're welcome take care hello how are you feeling today oh good i see your past medical history is missing do you by chance know if you've had any health related problems before thank you i just want to verify the information with you you had asthma nasal inflammation and some abnormal

on not the prostate right so i think they didn't really think much of it kind of reading their notes they just wanted to follow you no they said in your prostate they said there was a lesion on your kidney but the thing is is that it's gonna be hard for us to it looks like have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine cause it looks like you haven't refilled it since december okay okay yeah it's gonna be hard for us to like treat the rest of your pain you know if you're not really taking your blood pressure medicine uh let me see exactly what it is so it looks like okay okay uh it looks like uh let's see we did this you had an x-ray done of like your hip and your knee it looks like you got arthritis um let's see well you know for the pain you're having in your leg and your back you know we could probably do physical therapy cause we haven't sent you to physical therapy um you know otherwise there's not i mean i could send you to see the orthopedic surgeons to see if they'd like to operate on you but other than that there's not a whole lot we can do for arthritis uh-huh hmm uh-huh what symptoms are those well it's just poor circulation isn't a symptom like symptoms are like pain and tenderness and tingling poor circulation yeah well why don't you have a seat let's take a look at it how about that yeah do you know what the treatment is for; the first line treatment

we need some labs on you today we need to check your hepatitis levels you're due for a cholesterol check uh-huh hmm it's pretty unlikely hepatitis c the one you had that's mostly likely from either uh intravenous drug use or uh like a sexual encounter yeah just getting like immunizations it's extremely unlikely um alright let's see if you you had an appointment with the orthopedist oh you do cause it looks like you didn't make it to your last one got it got it oh perfect perfect perfect good yeah yeah got it uh are you sure we can't interest you in any vaccinations or a colonoscopy today we

hematuria @@@ left renal mass mri you had the mri they didn't really see that much so it seems like they uh so it just seems like they want to follow you for it they don't think it's much they think it might be a cyst on your kidney but hmm hmm yeah well i don't know you know they're the specialist they really should enlarged okay let's see well no actually they didn't think it was enlarged they it was normal uh like i say they're the prostate doctor @@@ well at least you got the five star treatment you know you got the head to toe exam right let's uh well i'll set you up to see the dermatologist when they check your head they can check this thing too okay sound good alright meds refill refill your meds ortho hold that thought and let me get some papers for you i'll be right back

wanted to ask today on on history was there anything else that maybe i forgot to ask about you wanted to mention yeah certainly um something that we'll be testing for today with some of the symptoms that you're having like um cough and some nonspecific symptoms like that can show up in covid um for sure so it will be important to get a test for that today which will require a nasal swab um that being said it could be uhm another type of viral illness like the common cold which is causing your your symptoms here today um and so it will be just be important to be diligent and if your symptoms diligent with the testing i mean with the covid and if your symptoms get any worse we it might be important to go to the hospital or or the emergency department have you had any surgeries in the past which knee date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ have a seat what @@@ @@@ good news so it looks like its working okay for you right that's good i look to see that you look a little steadier to me okay uh-huh okay like blacked out lost consciousness or okay hmm back in december okay so last night you didn't have any sense like oh my gosh i'm gonna pass out you didn't feel palpitations or lightheaded or anything all of a sudden you're on the floor okay and did anyone see it you saw it did it look like he passed out uh-huh okay uh-huh alright um were you doing anything at the time that you passed out so you weren't like drinking or eating anything or laughing okay okay you didn't lose continence of your bowels or bladder and you didn't urinate on yourself you don't shake uncontrollably or anything okay and how's your head feel today okay okay okay and how far up does it go the feel feel yeah i mean can you feel anything there okay yeah they were recommending a wheelchair; i saw that in their notes do you have one at home uh-huh yeah do you feel dizzy when that happens i mean do you yeah uh-huh upside down like okay okay okay let's see when you use the snowblower yeah yeah this is i mean uh-huh okay alright why don't you come over here and i'm going to have you lay down okay @@@ like this any chest pain or trouble breathing okay nausea vomiting okay diarrhea constipation okay are you taking stool softeners right now it doesn't sound much worse than the last time that i saw you here now put your left arm out for me that was 134/80 uh-huh now i'm going to have you sit up and we'll check it again do you feel dizzy when you sit up like the room is spinning or lightheadedness take a deep breath in and out oh i was able to go home yeah it was nice yeah syracuse new york not as much as uh like new york city and boston they are really yeah syracuse got four feet of snow in four days right before i arrived and then just as i was leaving was when that big blizzard was coming up the east coast and boston and new york @@@ i missed it i got a nice white christmas and i missed a lot of the actual snowfall so just relax your arm here okay i'm going to @@@ blood pressure okay that was actually it was 128/80 so pretty darn close so that's good i mean so your blood pressure doesn't seem to be dropping that would really explain now normally when you pass out like that is it um is it when you've been standing up for a while oh yeah we can oh i'm just going to look at the back of your head here do you have any pus or bleeding back here a little bit higher there i don't see any cuts or anything does that hurt when i'm pushing on it yeah okay alright the neurologist alright you had a bunch of falls since the last time you saw the neurologist right what are you scared of cause you don't get any warning right alright cause i think i mean from what it sounds like we've done a lot of tests a lot of work-up for the falls trying to figure out what's going on and we haven't had much luck determining exactly what the cause is we know we're thinking that's it's probably multifactorial that there are a few different things contributing to the falls that we need to try to minimize the risks from a bunch of different things um without being able to make these episodes go away completely i think the safest thing would probably be to have a wheelchair and just you know if you're sitting then it's not as hard to fall and that's basically i know it's not an answer and it's not very satisfying but for now that'll minimize the risk of hurting yourself when you fall um you know from things from my perspective as a medical doctor what we would worry about is your heart being related like something like having stenosis like a restriction in some of your heart valves which you don't have based on our last time we checked your heart um some sort of arrhythmia where your heart is going in and out of rhythm that would cause you to blackout but as far as we know that's not the case either um we would worry about your blood pressure dropping and sometimes that can be a result of just having neurological problems your body doesn't respond the same way to changes with position and kind of a uh-huh right um but based on you know what we just did checking your blood pressure in different positions it doesn't seem like your blood pressure is dropping when you sit up or stand up sometimes it's related it's called vasal vagal and it's like from standing for long periods of time um so it's kind of hard to say but from a lot of the things that i'm used to managing and dealing with we've kind of ruled those things out um it may be partly related to some of the medications you're given um helping one thing can sometimes just bring other problems and it may be related to the ataxia and you know the kind of a big syndrome of stuff you have going on that we're trying to get a handle on i don't know i don't have any great answers for you i wish i did he'll turn red and yeah are you i saw that you went back and got another swallow evaluation are you using the chin tuck and the maneuvers @@@ yeah okay yeah i mean yeah soup is actually hard because it's a mixture of consistencies you've got stuff that you have to chew yeah so you've got to your mouth has to kind of organize it and swallow things kind of one at a time; you've got the thin stuff and the big stuff so that actually can be kind of tricky a lot of times what they do is you know try to get people to separate their liquids and their solids yeah okay uh-huh have you ever tried using like thickening stuff and did that help at all okay really okay so you cough more when you're drinking thickened liquids i'll be right back okay do you know which medications that need refills okay okay @@@ four refills so @@@ and that was probably prescribed by the neurology folks but let me i'll go over the list with you when i get back alrighty i would like because it's been a while since you had your blood work done i'd like to do a little bit of blood work to make sure just check a few things to make sure we're not contributing to the falls that you're having and i would also like to check an ekg today uh we'll see if he's here he wasn't here this morning but we'll try no @@@ now the third thing we'd like to do i'm going to check like your vitamin d level which is something that's important for building you know strong bones and um the other thing i'd like to do just because of all these falls that are happening of course we want to avoid the falls as much as we can by um kind of like adapting to what's going on but i'd like to check a dexa scan of your bones and make sure that you don't have osteoporosis or anything like that some of these medications that you end up on for long periods of time can have a negative effect on your bones and i want to make sure that if you fall your bones are as strong as they can be to avoid a fracture i know but we don't want to @@@ that can be a devastating problem once it happens so it's an easy test um i'll put in the order for that and they can schedule it for you um you may need to call and schedule it actually but we'll see oh no have you had a dexa scan yeah we commonly get them for women but we don't really think of it for men vitamin d isn't that bad if you need it you take it once a week i can check and see when the last time was the last time you had labs here was a while ago they tried before but i guess they didn't get a good enough blood for it we'll try again let's see what we've got for medications uh-huh okay so you've got you filled it in july august then did you stop taking it for a while or uh when did you try to refill it okay what do you take that for it's like an allergy medication were you allergy problems but like seasonal allergies stuffy nose postnasal drip stuff like that yeah okay okay alright oh sorry did you need those to pick those up in the pharmacy or did you want them mailed okay okay alright so i'd like you to get that ekg done we'll see if they can do it for you up here but if not you may need to go down to the um cardiology lab down on the first floor so let me see if he's here if not i'll give you directions alright he's not here so we'll have you go downstairs um so you'll go down you know where the lab is downstairs right okay so we'll have you go there to get the blood tests done and then i'd like you to go to the you can kind of i think there are signs up that say like ekg testing it'll be on the first floor and you'll head towards four corners but uh before you get to four corners you'll turn left down what seems like kind of an empty hallway alright yeah it's between the elevators and @@@ oh did they send you down there for the ekg oh okay i've been told to send people it's on the first floor you can ask yeah ask around maybe they'll tell you i'm wrong but that's where i've been told to send people before yeah so yeah see what you can find out if they send you to the basement i apologize alright and i'll let you know what i find out from the tests and what the results are of the dexa scan yep uh yeah i mean i put the order in the computer so you can ask them up front if they can schedule for you if not then @@@ yeah take care be safe okay yeah we'll see you take care alright um it's in there three months three to four months </doctor> <patient> hi yes i'm just coming in uh over the last week i've been having um like a cough runny nose and a lot of congestion as well so i just wanted to come in here to make sure nothing's wrong a bit less than that i would say it's been probably like five or six days um it's kind of the same no it's mainly like a dry cough but i am getting like a lot of drainage and uh just congestion in my nose uh yeah sometimes i feel like that over the last week uh no no blood no no wheezing um no chest pain um no this is like fairly new yeah it's more like kind of a clear to maybe whitish discharge um yeah around the same time uh no nothing like that yeah that happens and sometimes the nostrils keep switching um just when i'm congested like i feel like i can't really smell no uh no no i don't think so uhm maybe a little bit of a tickle in my throat but not sore no no no nothing like that no no no changes uhm no nothing like that uh no no diarrhea nope uh nope nothing like that uhm no nothing like that uh no i've been i haven't been tired or like it's just been like these symptoms that don't seem to go away no no uh no that's pretty much it uh no i've been pretty healthy uhm no nothing like that um i've just been taking like tylenol cold but it's not really been helping too much uh no um yeah so i just live in an apartment with my boyfriend and uh live like just within the city yeah i'm working uh currently um just at a grocery store uh not that i know of yeah i haven't seen anyone like have symptoms or anything no i've been in the province yep uh yeah usually like just condoms uh no i don't think so uh no i have haven't haven't smoked ever uh yeah no no marijuana either uh just like once or twice in a week yeah so i would say like it would usually be wine uh no nothing else um not that i know of no no uh no i just yeah i was just wondering if like i should be worried at all about covid yep sounds good thank you so much yes i had knee surgery right yeah alright thank you @@@ @@@ i’ve got good news and bad news @@@ walked in so far i haven't felt it um it @@@ since i've fallen eight times in december and i fell last night i don't even know how i don't explain how i how you fell you were just standing he was just standing i don't know if you took a drink or were going to and all of a sudden you just went down he doesn't remember it cause he says what happened so he kind of fell backwards and he hit head again again i put a hole in the one door hurt like heck yeah no all of a sudden i was on the floor yeah it looked like; well actually he didn't know what happened and it's as if he was awake i mean it was very fast probably five seconds or so so it wasn't like the kind fell on the kitchen floor when i said he really was unconscious his coughing choking is getting worse i was just standing at the counter as i know i don't know i was at the other end i don't think i was drinking anything cause i don't remember well you had a glass in front of you but i don't know if he actually drank or not i don't remember no no my head feels well sore where i hit it but my neck is @@@ real sore almost to the touch what was the third thing there was a third thing we were going to tell you and i forgot neck and fall but there's a third thing and i still can't feel anything as you can tell right there i have no idea how i got that this was bigger before it's healed a little bit i have no idea how that happened the feeling no i can't think of the third thing oh even the therapist recommended i suggested a wheelchair too no we're gonna i think we're gonna get one for when i walk long distances like here or like go to a mall or whatever sometimes it takes me a while when i stand up it’s like i get my blood flowing down to my legs i think you should tell her about how you feel in the oh yeah there's been two times now where like i'll go over and i feel like i'm upside down i don't know yeah everything seems like it's upside down i'll wake up and i'll feel like i'm off the bed and upside down it's more than two times cause he's had that before yeah yeah and when he's in the car he feels like what things are roller coaster like when you're going down yeah i've mentioned that to her before that see i knew i'd make your day complicated but it seems like i use a snow blower for the snow we’ve been having as long as i got that in front of me i seem to be okay yeah as long as i got something in front of me to hold to but when i go to use a cane i don't so i'm using the snowblower right outside like the other day when i rode a bike to work i had two people @@@ there was a slight little hill and it was a little bit slippery and they offered and so i took uptown we'll see what happens let's see the last time @@@ feel like the roller coastering no no constipation means that the bowel movements seem extremely big no i can't tell are my words slurred what's it at now it's come down some a little not too bad lightheaded where did you go over the holidays oh that's good you were on the east coast then ooh you got nailed with snow oh boston's getting hit again my nephew goes to school in boston and he called yesterday or today i think it was yesterday oh it was yesterday oh my gosh but you got out in time what is it now there are worse no actually i could be sitting remember when i fell in the bedroom i was sitting and i fell off the bed yeah but i that was just a fall i don't think it was like a loss of consciousness we have some medication to be refilled that they won't let me refill it over the phone hopefully we can do it oh shoot she is going to do that she's getting the glove no not that i know of @@@ up a little bit higher yeah right where your hand was right in through there yeah no well this time it was a solid wall last time it was the corner i thought she was going to @@@ she don't like to do that yeah and it's getting scary when i fall and i don't know why i fall right well what's kind of weird and everything has been the time of the day it @@@ at night or in the morning or sometimes in the after you know i never know uh-huh what's really hard for him now is he's choking so violently he'll sit down and just take one bite yeah and once he just gets through this thing he seems to be okay it's just like that first swallows are really violent uh-huh @@@ even when i drink i try to make sure i'm over the table or something i try to encourage him to take smaller bites and to chew it better @@@ or even when it's plain like we had soup and that went down real easy and i was even coughing with that real bad he has yeah little lumps in it yeah well i'm still going like this even when i'm drinking anything it's very very frustrating i get kind of upset when i start coughing so bad no it seems the thinner it is the better it is seems like it alright you want to do these medications @@@ when she gives that well this one's zero and he said um @@@ that he called and wouldn't refill it okay okay okay can you do that up here okay it don't like you it don't want you to do that sounds alarming i haven't broke anything yet yeah i should ask the dietician like stuff i should do cause i've fallen twice in the last month yeah i take vitamin d too just what i need more pills i know those are those pretty green pills i thought they checked once for vitamin d @@@ when do you want my medication reviewed um i need amlodipine i have nothing left on that etodolac i only got two left on that and that really really works @@@ the what @@@ it says there are four refills yeah @@@ i don't have any uh this week sometime i don't even know okay probably for my nose well it seems i do but i don't know what i'm allergic to i'm allergic to coffee and uh or caffeine and penicillin that's all i know of stuffy nose all the time then i got one more @@@ i think that's it no i'll just get them mailed if they can it's easier that way okay okay yeah okay

any medical problems okay any brothers or sisters healthy as far as you know uh any children how many children do you have and they're healthy do you ever check your blood pressure at home okay well we can get you one here too um that's always down in the prosthetic lab they have blood pressure cuffs and we can get you your blood pressure is a little bit high today so i was just wondering if you uh if you normally run high or if it's usually pretty good okay okay okay okay well we'll recheck it; maybe it was just the pressure at that moment um i'll recheck it at the end of the visit have you ever had a colonoscopy done no who was the last primary doctor you saw where was he @@@ oh yeah there is yeah um as far as vaccinations do you have the tetanus shot pneumonia shot @@@ okay you had the pneumonia vaccine and you're current with tetanus okay when did you have the pneumonia vaccine do you remember okay and when was your tetanus can you remember uh well when was that is a vaccine or give you the ppd and they had you go back and they looked at it okay that wasn't a vaccination just so you know so um that is what they do is they inject they basically boil down tuberculosis and kill it and then they inject the particles under your skin to see if your body reacts to it um if it reacts to it then they think that maybe you had it in the past the reason i tell you that is that there is a tb vaccine which is almost never used anymore except for in europe um it's called bcg vaccine they use it over in europe a lot but it's not used much in america but it can give you a false positive for your tb so it's a good idea to know if you've ever had that cause they'll put a ppd on you and it'll be positive and then you'll get treatment for tb yeah @@@ fine oh so yeah that makes sense that makes sense okay um do you want to get the shingles we can get that for you today i think it's a good idea especially working in the hospital @@@ the shingles is basically the reactivation of chicken pox have you ever had chicken pox before okay uh as far as the flu shot we don't have the seasonal flu shot anymore that's kind of okay so that's good um uh so you still need the seasonal flu shot every year okay uh oh sure yeah sure um have you ever smoked okay have you ever had an ultrasound of the abdomen done to look for aneurysms or anything um we generally recommend at the age of 65 there is some evidence showing that anyone who smoked as many as 10 packs of cigarettes in their entire life um are at an increased risk for an aneurysm in the aorta so at the age 65 for anyone that's ever smoked we recommend a one-time ultrasound just to take a look to see if there are any aneurysm if it looks fine then everything's fine you know if it is a problem then you know whatever intervention is necessary is taken um its pain free it's quick takes a couple of minutes i think it's a good idea that's what i tell most of my patients okay good now as far as the colonoscopy so you've never had done um starting at the age of 50 we recommend uh you know starting screening for colorectal cancer um would you be opposed to just seeing our gi doctor about getting a colonoscopy okay okay okay i will say you know what you're not the first person i've had issues with first when i talked my dad into doing it just a couple years ago cause he turned 50 like two years ago and um he said the worst part was the prep the night before the actual procedure doesn't hurt at all; you're pretty much asleep for the whole thing the night before they make you drink a bunch of stuff to clean your bowels out and but it's i think most people who have it done uh in the end say it was much ado about nothing @@@ just a reassurance okay sure double check your labs just to see so yeah it looks like everything here hasn't been done that we would use can i have this copy or do you need it back okay so i'm going to put this in our computer it looks like these are all current so we don't need to get any lab work on you today this was done a month ago most of the stuff so okay can you sit up here i want to take a quick listen to you and i want to check your blood pressure whose name is it oh yeah we can get that for you it's not a problem um the only thing i would say is how much do you pay for it now uh-huh $20 okay so i think the va medications we can get you are $8 a month i don't know how much for a three month supply but i know some of these medications like metformin i think i was just hearing something about was it walmart or target is now offering metformin for free um it's a new promotion they're running i don't know if it's going to be forever or if it's just kind of a new thing they're doing three months’ supply of both for $20 yeah yeah and that's $20 total for both medications yeah that's going to be cheaper than you're going to get it here i'm pretty sure um i could put it in the computer and i have no problem letting you get your medication from here from a cost perspective you'd probably save a couple of bucks getting it from walmart um but that's up to you yeah we'll get you that can you give me a couple of deep breaths please can you lay back for me any pain there can you open your mouth and say ah okay did you have surgery on your nose what was that for you can sit up did they tell you what was it okay take a deep breath for me they got all of it okay do remember what kind of cancer squamous cell basal cell do you remember basal okay any swelling in the feet ever okay do you mind taking your shoes off for me i'm sure that you know with diabetes you get the increased risk of foot ulcers so we'll take a quick look at your feet to make sure they look okay um do you have an eye doctor okay do you want us to do that for you with diabetes you should be checking your eyes uh yes i'll be honest i don't know anything about how insurance works here um i just don't do any of that that side of it if you ask up front at the desk they may have a little more information about how insurance works here yeah i know to be honest with you okay yeah how the va does billing we don't do any of that i mean from the medical side you know the doctors don't do any of that so i don't know how that works uh up front they'll either be able to tell you how it works or they can send you to the office that can tell you how that stuff works okay do you have any problems with your eyes yeah okay but no problems from the diabetes as far as you know have you ever taken an aspirin uh like a daily aspirin okay well aspirin um there's a lot of studies on aspirin and heart disease uh mostly aspirin is really not a great pain medication um stuff like advil tylenol are better but what aspirin does that's nice from a medical standpoint is that it attaches to the platelets and makes platelets from not be able aggregate as much so it makes the blood not clot as much um so that reduces the risk of strokes heart attacks all that kind of stuff in people who are at risk uh in a lot of our diabetic patients we recommend a baby aspirin a day just 81 mg when you take aspirin for like pain its 650 mg but a small dose of aspirin 81 mg a day uh has been shown to reduce the risk of uh heart attacks coronary events uh just because that has a platelet property uh it's absolutely indicated for everyone who's had heart attacks or heart disease in the past but there's a lot of evidence saying that it's probably beneficial in patients who have a lot of risk factors like diabetes regular baby aspirin a day yeah so i'd probably recommend that to you it's a loose recommendation but um probably help you more than it would hurt you they look good have you ever had any cuts bruises hard time healing no okay okay but no problems with healing down there diabetes can cause a problem with the blood vessels in your legs uh it can cause circulation sure okay can you close your eyes for me do you feel this yeah excellent do you feel that do you feel that there feel that here here here okay do you feel this you feel that do you feel that how about here here here here okay i tested you just to check the nerves in the foot diabetes can cause problems with the nerves in the foot but we can you feel that feel that feel that feel that how about over here over here okay same thing feel that here how about here here here here here here right here okay that's good oh yeah just a little test we do to make sure that uh the nerves in the foot are @@@ i'll check your blood pressure too uh you can pull it up it's kind of easier let me check your arm there thanks let me just write this down you know @@@ it's the only one i could find in the clinic let's try it again it's a little bit too big but @@@ it's a lot better 124/64 were you a little worked up when i first took it okay i'm never on time oh yeah singles vaccine @@@ back order yeah i know they keep it in stock at loyola but i think here if i remember right it's frozen or cooled or something like that and they have to thaw it out and send it back out um i can't even find it where is it i need to figure out what's going on @@@ i'll be right back okay i'll be with you in a second okay i figured it up i don't work back in this clinic all that often so you know once every two weeks generally so you kind of have to relearn everything you come here but you do have to schedule another appointment they don't do it in the clinic um so they want me to tell you @@@ the only medication that seems to pop up with herpes vaccine was a randomized controlled trial involving 38,000 patients; the vaccine was shown to reduce the incidence of shingles by 51.3% and the incidence of post herpetic neuralgia which is the chronic pain you get from shingles by almost 2/3 so it's pretty good data for it um the shingles vaccine um if there's a problem with it i know you can get the shingles vaccine at any dominick or walgreens and it's pretty cheap i know it's actually my patients at loyola i don't know how much it is at loyola and i don't know how much it is at dominick but i know it's significantly cheaper but i don't even give it to people at loyola i just tell them to go to dominick or walgreens um but you can ask them when you sign out uh how much it is and what the insurance benefits are or they can give you someone to call to know and they should be able to tell you uh i put those medications in for you um the only thing that i did notice it wouldn't cause me to change anything on you today um but someone who's a diabetic our goals for ldl and hdl here generally above 40 and below 70 okay hdl is good cholesterol and ldl is the bad cholesterol you want your good cholesterol high and your bad cholesterol low for diabetics there's a lot of evidence that shows uh you get good cardiac risk prevention if your hdl is greater than 40 or your ldl is less than 70 so we want to get this number down and this number up best way to do that is through diet and exercise um diet stuff cholesterol you want to stay away from and i don't know if you've heard this before but stay away from saturated fats and trans fats those are what kills you for cholesterol uh trans fats anything you read where the package says partially hydrogenated vegetable oils um a lot of your like processed foods processed cheeses uh processed peanut butter have partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or trans fats those are bad for making the ldl high best thing to get the ldl low and the hdl high is uh not avoiding fats actually it's just how well what kind of fats so you want to go after the unsaturated fats unsaturated fats are actually good for you the thinking used to be stay away from fats at all costs don't ever eat any fats that's kind of changed a little bit i mean obviously you don't want to do too much fats because they still have a lot of calories um but in terms of the heart stuff and your cholesterol uh good fats like olive oil the vegetable oils actually help they make your cholesterol profile better good yeah good okay yeah that's good the other thing that's good is i don't know what you eat for dinner and stuff like that but fish is excellent you love fish good eat as much fish as you can better than it's @@@ than red meat i mean i'm not going to tell you i love steak as much as the next person i'm not going to tell you i never eat steak but okay yeah yeah chicken pork are better than red meat fish in terms of this is better than all of them because it has those omega 3 fatty acids are unsaturated fats so they help out a lot the other thing is exercise and i know you said you walk 5-6 miles a night and that's great but exercise as much as you can um we can watch this for now if it doesn't go down a little bit we can always maybe try starting you on like fish oil tablets or something like that or there are statins which is a cholesterol medication which a lot of people use and get pretty good results with but if we can keep you off of the medication for now we'll try that sure let's try that okay the hemoglobin a1c looks great uh the psa looks great uh everything else looks fine okay i don't see anything else that's worrisome um so when you check out today uh um yeah it's a little high here i noticed that i can't explain that but it looks fine um on what yeah it's hard to tell what that's from it's one isolated potassium isn't like cholesterol where it's kind of a thing that you know um in the absence of kidney failure it's hard to say what that was from whether you maybe had a glass of orange juice before you came in or a banana or something like that but um you know this isn't that worrisome i mean the normal level here is 5.2 at the va its 5.4 so that would still be considered; it's very close to normal um if this was consistently high or if it was going up i'd be a little bit more worried about it um i don't think that this lab value is enough cause for concern that you should stop eating vegetables you cut back well i mean moderation is always what we preach here uh but i'd rather have you eating green beans than eating a pizza or something you know you know that's kind of a fine line we walk you know if you're hungry if you're going to you know crack open some carrots and celery or some green beans it's a lot better than some of the things you could be doing well good you'd be surprised how many people don't think the way you think yeah yeah well right yeah and we want to keep those you know so so most of my diabetic patients at least initially i like to see every three months and if we get everything stabilized and you know probably change it out to six months is that okay with you okay you'll be seeing me okay you'll be seeing me okay okay any questions it was nice meeting you when you check out ask them about the uh the shingles vaccine okay cause they have to get you a separate appointment for that it's not an appointment with me it's a nurse appointment you have to actually have the shingles vaccine up right right here you go sir nice meeting you take care okay okay bye bye </doctor> <patient> that would be me okay no sir not really i've been sitting @@@ a lot sicker longer than waiting here sir before we start i would like to here's my full chart for the last four or five years uh dupage medical group okay well i just i needed a doctor i lost my insurance my job i have some kind of insurance now but it's not good enough so i thought i'd come here that's in a nutshell right there i'm not really sick but you know i don't want to take a chance uh diabetic no sure uh at first but um if it starts running a little high they throw me on a diet per say uh uh starches potassium is too high or uh cholesterol i could do this with my diet i just need to know you know what to do medication i take um uh glipizide 5 mg once a day at breakfast half hour before i eat i also take metformin 500 mg twice a day after i eat a.m and p.m no sir i'm not allergic to anything well i want to yeah but it's quite alright i want to be upfront with you okay i'm here for you to help me not you know there's no secrets in this um i like my legs i like my

i'm lacking is the flu shot and he was kind of concerned about um yes it was about two or three years ago about the same the only thing i haven't got is the shingles and uh everything's current i even

yeah that's how i got the job; i had to pass that to get working in the hospital so i mean you know but the only thing i haven't got is the flu shot and the shingles alright @@@ to do this i might have i don't know i had the swine flu is what i had i had the opportunity to get that and i did yeah well when you're working i can do different things but when i'm not working it's pretty hard i mean you know as far as insurance wise you know yes i have no well if my shot records up i'm not running scared okay not right away let's put that on the back burner i have issues with that but anyway that i could turn my head quick that'll do the same no i'm next time i come in i might ask for it you understand that's the way i am okay um i have some you can do anything you want sir okay i have some

<doctor> how long have you been feeling weakness and fatigue have you lost weight as a result wow that's concerning are you experiencing any nausea vomiting diarrhea or abdominal pain how about chest pain shortness of breath cough or heart racing any neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling we'll get to the bottom of this i'm waiting for your lab report to come back and then we can figure out the next steps </doctor> <patient> well i'd say it's been a lot worse this week i haven't had much of an appetite either i've lost about eight pounds which is the most i've ever lost in a week's time no no no </patient>,True,0,True,1,False,True
<doctor> i'm sorry to hear that we'll get to the bottom of it when did you first start noticing this any chest pain or tightness with the shortness of breath any fever chills or sweats any cough or coughing up blood how about wheezing or swelling in your legs </doctor> <patient> oh doc i've had a lot of trouble breathing lately yeah i lose my breath so quickly with just one to two flights of stairs i believe two weeks ago no thankfully no no no </patient>,True,1,True,0,True,False
<doctor> what brings this little guy in today sorry to hear that did he have a fever and did you give him anything for the fever i see and how has he felt otherwise has he been coughing at all any shortness of breath how about any episodes of vomiting diarrhea or stomach pain </doctor> <patient>  </patient>,True,1,True,1,True,True
<doctor> so what uh brings you here today okay um and can you describe the cough a little bit is it a dry cough or is she bringing anything up okay and um what does the cough sound like is it like a harsh cough a barky cough okay is it kind of a wheeze okay um and so there's episodes where she also turns blue okay oh i see okay um any blood in the vomit or is she coughing up any blood no okay um any so this started two weeks ago any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um cold-like symptoms before then okay um other than the cough uh any any fevers or chills okay and the cough is pretty constant or is it does it come and go okay and is there anything that has helped her at all like any over the counter medications or anything like that okay um and so has this happened before at all no this is the first time okay um any so she she is vomiting um is the vomit like green in colour or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten what's the content of the moment okay um any sick contacts recently or any travel um and how about her behaviour does she seem like uh very tired or fatigued or more irritable okay okay um any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation okay any um any trouble with urinating at all no how's her sleeping like okay any uh exposure to dust or fumes or animals or pets at home okay um and any has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past um and any allergies that you know of and um any previous hospitalizations or surgeries and how was your pregnancy your pregnancy with her like any complications at all and was she at term or premature was it a vaginal delivery or uh a c-section and did she have to stay in the nicu at all at the hospital afterwards okay and is she feeding well like what does she usually eat um and any family history of any medical conditions um and does anyone smoke in the house and what's her living situation like who does she live with and do you live in a house apartment okay and any difficulties or complications with her growth like in terms of her weight or her height okay and in terms of her milestones has she been meeting all of them on time okay alright so i think those are all the questions i have for you today do you have any questions or concerns yeah so based on the symptoms oh yeah sorry i forgot to ask one other question has she are her immunizations all up to date and have you been vaccinated throughout your life yeah so there is definitely uh there's a lot of research done beside behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research so definitely it's very important to get your child vaccinated in fact the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis and um there's usually a vaccination for that like after pregnancy as well so that's something that is definitely on the differential and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done see her oxygenation saturation and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital and we may need to admit her but we'll do the full physical examination today get a covid swab done as well and usually it she's currently in the it seems to be the second phase where she's vomiting and coughing a lot and then it usually after that phase two or three more weeks of just coughing and so we're going to do some supportive care for her right now but yeah definitely you should consider vaccinating your child we recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child alright so so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well okay alright take care thank you for coming in to see us at a b c d general hospital today i understand before we begin how old are you which race and gender do you identify with what's seems to be causing you pain today is the pain worsening how have you managed this bunion in the past date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hey how you guys doing yeah it’s about time we saw each other @@@ all the way back here okay this is it wherever you want to sit no you're fine okay okay what was she asking do you mind me asking what she was asking you what was she asking you so really focused on @@@ i'm gonna tell you my rule for blood pressure with my patients if you're going to the trouble of writing all these down every day i trust the numbers you're taking i'll check it again but even if it still comes back high today after that kind of experience my blood pressure would be high right now oh here they can get rid of @@@ we're kind of getting off if it keeps you from getting fired but i'm going to pull up your chart while your @@@ down okay yes you were i remember yeah the additional one @@@ i think you know the answer okay we'll cancel that and take that one out if you're doing well on this one this has a half-life of one day so if you've been taking this every day and it lasts all day and it's keeping your blood pressure fine hey less is better is more let’s get rid of the one you don't need just take the full thing so you've got a good one that works well for you huh and you're breathing one (laughter) no this has a different one this has got both in here albuterol plus ipratropium let me look at this for you hmm let me read my last notes to jog my memory real quick how's your shingles doing but it's gone good good good yeah vaccine of course not why you know would the va do anything efficiently let me check and see i know when i inquired earlier this month they didn't have it you know what i bet they have i just i usually don't hold my breath for such things alright let's see you're over 60 okay i do not expect you to live less than a year they actually ask me these questions you did take a bath you don't have any blood cancers you're not taking steroids have you ever had a reaction to gelatin a medication called neomycin anything like that um when you were younger you never had tuberculosis did you and you've never had the vaccine before the shingles okay yeah it's been out for like four or five years maybe a little bit longer yeah it's becoming to the point where now we know enough about it to say go get it but before they had it we were just like do we give it do we not give it we're not sure it’s only been out a couple of months @@@ still not you're still indicated to get it even if you had the shingles how about now did you get the vaccine let me see uh uh oh it looks like they may have it at the pharmacy so let me put it in we'll see what happens okay you've seen a multitude of yeah he's a german guy and he speaks really fast he actually says because he's a lung specialist i think this one was working well for you yeah but now well he just basically said in his notes he would prefer you to be on this one and not this one he thinks this was gonna be better for your cough which one did you thought worked better for you this one helps you more yeah i'm not supposed to go against them because they're the boss but we'll make the change i'll write in my note you symptomatically noted that this is better for you and i think between the two at this point it's what makes you feel better you know they're not neither of these are gonna change what's going on inside your lungs the chronic bronchiectasis the mass you see they'll always be there we just want you to feel better if you think that they cancelled the order for this that's why you can't get any more of it i can put it back in but i have to get rid of this one and i'll write in my note that we thought this was more beneficial for you and that's why we're switching it back okay and before i do that let me listen to your lungs really good can you take off your shirt they have the same power this has the exact same power but this has an additional medication in it called ipratropium which works on a different part of your lungs we can keep that if you want this one it's purely up to you it's the same amount of albuterol in both of them so you want this one okay we'll keep it as the lung doctor suggests i think @@@ oh is he over at uic i'm going to check your lungs; can you take a deep breath out good in and out in and out one more @@@ any pain here let me see you skin any new lesions on your skin you notice anything new they got you a nice tie high and tight didn't they and this hasn't changed at all has it the redness in the cheeks when was the last time when was the last time they had to freeze off some of the skin lesions from the derm clinic dermatology did they recommend that for you the dermatologists freezing off like lesions do you check your skin every at least every couple of months look for new lesions but you are still seeing them though right once a year it's better if you do it yourself in between; the year long time between when you see them only because a lot can happen in a year oh that's probably just from @@@ yeah well alright you be the spotter okay let me see your legs any swelling it's probably just a touch of water not a lot it's @@@ socks @@@ no no that's not the reason uh you may just have thought it was but i think yeah really definitely you'd come tell us if you were i mean that's yeah but when you fall asleep it goes down @@@ ear drops no problem how are you cleaning your ears you're not using q-tips are you are you using any q-tips right just making sure okay but when you put the drops in you just let it run out on their own right so it runs out good any questions tramadol it's a pretty good pain medication it doesn't have too many side effects what kind of pains are you using it for yeah that’s right the knee thing so when you do your snow removal i guess you're gonna have a lot of work to do tomorrow huh okay how far out do you guys live in chicago bad traffic yeah he had them just about five months ago which @@@ for him he's not on any medications that will mess up his labs so usually once a year is enough if something changes clinically or he's having some new symptoms then we recheck them but i think the next time you come in we'll get some repeat labs so let me make sure all your medications look okay before you leave your inhalers they're all good set-up for you for a year okay your blood pressure pill is good until november you have all the refills you'll need uh you're still on you don't need the gabapentin anymore right the gabapentin the one you took for shingles you're not taking that anymore are you let me get rid of that uh oh it mentions when was the last time you got a shot in your knee are they still doing that did it help at all the tramadol has been working okay though the ultram the pain medication it's still helping though it's still helping okay that's good just not cutting it i'm gonna refill this one cause this one's out so you're on 50 one tablet three times a day okay and i'll put that in the mail for you or do you want to pick it up today yeah i'm gonna send you to the pharmacy as soon as i go talk to my boss i'll send you to the pharmacy now to pick up the shot and then hopefully one of the nurses we'll see if we can find a different one will give you the shot okay does that sound okay that and then this one you can pick up today if you'd like um how long does one of those tubes of earwax softener last for how often do you use it every day and then how long have you had that bottle for let me talk to my boss real quick okay it's in there i already checked i'll be right back i'll have you guys go to the pharmacy to get your stuff uh @@@ get

coughing and and then she just you know once she'll start coughing she just doesn't stop and then um there's been times when she just turns blue she's coughing so much um and then it just gets gets better um on its own but yeah it's a dry cough um it's just she just makes this noise when she's like breathe trying to take a breath in it's it's yeah yeah sure when she's coughing a lot yeah she does she's also vomited once or twice no yeah yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose it was just uh watery uh since discharge and at that time her cough she had a cough as well um but i thought it was you know it's nothing it was just like another flu and it would get better but then she just the runny nose got better without in a couple of days but the cough stayed and it got got pretty worse uh it got worse no i don't think she's had fevers i haven't checked though yeah she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue or just um get better in a couple couple minutes this kind of comes and goes like that i haven't tried anything i'm just worried about you know she's my first child and i don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age so i just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter no it's usually just what she's eaten no i don't think so not nothing really she does get tired especially after and then she's irritable and crying after you know she has these fits of coughs yeah no no uh not great it's just the cough keeps uh waking her up and she just doesn't can't fall asleep we we did get a cat um about a month ago no um no no no no complications it was uh it was very yeah it went well she was at term she was born at term uh vaginal no she's feeding well she's doing uh she eats everything yeah no um her dad but he he doesn't smoke in front of her oh yeah we live in an apartment it's uh me my partner her and the cat no no complications she's doing okay yes uh no oh no no i don't i don't get those my friend's my friend's daughter developed autism and i'm just i don't want that you know so no i don't vaccinate my kids or i don't vaccinate my daughter and i haven't been yeah uh no i won't be doing that um maybe when i was young but i yeah i don't i just don't believe in vaccinations i yeah no i don't i don't get those okay i'll think about it sure i wish i wasn't here right now i'm seventy seven years young i'm an african american woman i've had this bunion on my foot for as long as i can remember yes it is so painful i've tried to avoid surgery for so long but i want this bunion gone i've used antiinflammatories rested changed my activities i've done everything but this pain is getting worse and worse i need it gone doing good @@@ @@@ we got the @@@ taken yeah this is about medication and most of all most of all it's about blood pressure medication and we did not have the world's best nurse she got 151 over something or other i've been taking it at home and i've never gotten that high she was asking him inappropriate questions huh she was asking do i ever bathe did i take a bath this morning can i change my own clothes can i eat by myself i've never been asked that and then she kept saying to somebody outside can i go can i go and then she left so i told her i told her this is about blood pressure medication and she you know it was a losing situation just to be sure you might want to take my blood pressure yourself yeah okay she was the same one by the way a couple of months ago we were here for four hours we were here till they closed she locked the door locked us in and left and then left so then the doctor had to open the door try to get the papers so she would know who she was treating it's just so different i'm sure they've got rules here that make it hard to get rid of nurses but @@@ finger in her ear and her nose yeah that was weird too never saw anything like that @@@ okay wait wait wait wait here is something like okay here's i had been taking this for a long time i was taking this for a long time so i been out of this for about a month just taking this and i'm getting good readings so maybe you don't need the other one don't take this anymore okay yeah i used to cut them in half but then you told me just to take the whole thing okay and so that's uh here's now here's the problem oh gosh yes anyway i can't renew this they tell me they didn't have it anymore when they told her he wanted me to take this one gone i had them 30 days yes well speaking of shingles did they ever get the vaccine so that's really a long time they said they would have it by january well obviously you would have been dead a long time yes i took a bath today (laughs) uh uh no i don't have a reaction i don't think he got sick from any medicines that we know of no no which vaccine no yeah he gets just the shingle disease i thought that the vaccine was new is it that long i thought it was just this year this is the first year i heard of it @@@ okay maybe that's why i didn't know about it i had it in 97 and nobody offered me a vaccine no i had it in 97 but i @@@ had the shingles not yet i'm gonna ask my doctor about it and i can see @@@ he could get one dose today when we're done right yeah we've had indian doctors syrian doctors and a guy we thought was from turkey it's always like being @@@ yeah yeah it was and they won't renew it and it hasn't been and you thought this one was we thought the other one cause now since he's been on this one he's never stopped coughing yeah that's right okay when you say you're gonna put this in for me yeah he can put it back in just put it back in here this is more powerful i think so give me your @@@ oh they do so why don't we keep that then yeah yeah this one this one yeah decide on this one yeah so @@@ he's treating our daughter uh-huh @@@ no @@@ shingles  that's my son he's cheap i don't know the shingles is gone 30 days that was so gradual; i didn't notice what it was oh they did he took off something yes one time the last time remember no i should we do once a year or two no we're just counting on dermatology to do it once a year do you think this is something i'll let her do it because i'm a bad spotter okay yeah yeah spotters huh no now everybody talks about that and maybe all the @@@ i think its muscle honest to god or a lot of water yeah everybody talks about that as if i'm gonna die from it but as far as lungs go i go to the health club and work out strenuously and i do snow removal now and i'm not getting shortness of breath honest to god that's the good thing about it the thing is he doesn't usually cough while he's sleeping well see when i get horizontal i cough while he’s up he’s coughing all the time it seems to stop cause i'm up and he's still sleeping his coughing stops okay i'd like to get this renewed i kept getting wax in my ears huh huh no no that's a bad thing to do he has a brush that he uses to clean out his hearing aids yeah no i was gonna ask if you could renew this but it looks like we've got enough cause this certainly helps what is it ultram right yeah i use it after working out doing anything strenuous and my knee it seems to work better than anything else i don't overdose it though no if it says take two i only take one at a time just to  i use a snow blower he's got the snow blower all ready my son paid $350 for it to save my life but once in a while i use a shovel we're from chicago we live in towards the north side @@@ there must have been a terrible accident today on the way @@@ but they had a sign up even that there was an accident around sacramento and it really really was crawling so i really @@@ i think that by the time that we got there they had moved away the vehicles has he had blood tests in a while okay yeah these are good yeah huh no it didn’t work it stopped working that's all that's left huh oh yeah those shots in my knees and i had a lot of them it stopped okay i don't do that i just take it one at a time in the mail just mail them could he get the shot today oh yeah they can mail this okay tylenol in the mail @@@ and the new inhaler keep i can't tell

the cough is it dry or you're bringing up phlegm okay and does it sound harsh okay is it getting worse do you think okay are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with the cough okay any wheeziness no chest pain okay do you ever feel like your heart's racing okay um any dizziness or fainting spells uh numbness or tingling uh confusion or memory loss this headache is it always there yeah um sides of your head okay and 1 to 10 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt how how would you rate it a 4 okay so it's not the worst headache you've ever had in your life yeah um okay and have you like do you usually get headaches okay yeah that makes sense um have you had any fevers recently okay how about weight loss have you experienced any weight loss recently okay um any rashes okay um and any changes in your hearing or vision runny nose or stuffy nose sore throat okay um alright how about changes in your smell or taste um changes in your bowel movements okay um and then nausea or vomiting okay um changes in your urine okay good and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions okay um do you also take anything else for that asthma or is it just the ventolin that use okay have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past okay um are you on any medications besides ventolin okay how long have you been on that for okay and um are you up to date with all your immunizations okay okay good any allergies no medicines okay any family history of lung or heart diseases okay um and do you smoke no okay any other recreational drugs like marijuana cocaine heroin or anything like that okay how about um alcohol do you drink okay are you currently sexually active okay so you use both condoms and you're on birth control so okay good that's a lot of protection um how long have you two been together okay okay good and um any sick contacts recently no okay any travel recently okay okay wow congrats um and where do you live and who do you live with okay and is everyone at home healthy okay okay well those were all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions um or anything that you wanted to bring up that i haven't covered yeah for sure we will definitely um take a swab from you today and we'll see um what the results are you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um and if it's not covid if that comes back negative and um yeah some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year so for that just it's um you should just um do some supportive care you know staying hydrated eating well and if your symptoms become worse uh you're running a really high fever you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures then you should seek help from the er how does that sound okay great thank you any known allergies any allergy to any drug date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ did you have a nice christmas yes i saw you had @@@ the er for the back yeah so you still haven’t done the mri i see did they even call you next month did they schedule it @@@ okay at 8 o'clock and then you're gonna see the rehab doctor on the 7th uh-huh but the prednisone can only be given for like a very short time and so they only gave you the one week we can't put on that long term cause it can cause diabetes osteoporosis along with other stuff so this is a steroid this is the vicodin has that been helping okay did these help when you took em okay cause i can refill this this one i won't give you again because this is this is a medication we give sparingly because of all the side effects okay this we can we can i can give you more of until we get you to the rehab doctor so they can do the exercises that you need okay mometasone and what's this one flunisolide uh let me see if it's available cause what they did is they they went and changed it on their own when there was a shortage and this is the inhaler let me see if if this is available okay how often are you doing the @@@ how often were you doing this one okay let's see if it’s    so you were doing it as an inhaler right not a nasal spray right yeah see it’s not even coming up as an option the problem is they’re not even it's not even being offered anymore this was in place of this that's not working for you or not as good okay how's the uh how's the breathing i saw that yeah that's a hell of a time though especially for a sleep study on christmas eve laughter i'm surprised anyone was working in this place okay so the they'll try to do it again are you still having troubles with the shortness of breath at night no okay um are you noticing that you're getting short of breath regularly or no okay so with what you're on i know this is not as good as that was but with what we have you on the albuterol and ipratropium separately you feel that things are okay okay alright and then i know that you saw the rheumatologist and they put a they gave you a shot in your shoulder it didn’t help okay well let me see here patient shoulder @@@ emergency @@@ who won't let you go back to work uh-huh uh-huh yes yeah okay @@@ okay yeah well right cause we were thinking it was the peripheral vascular disease that you had before but finally that checked out to make sure that wasn't the reason and so that wasn't so it's probably the nerve so we'll see what the mri shows um you know yeah i'll order it it's your right shoulder right you have no implants or foreign objects shrapnel none of that stuff okay you're not claustrophobic okay now i have to do it all over again but so the shoulder is unchanged when you're taking the vicodin was that helping at all with the shoulder uh-huh uh-huh okay so i'm just gonna order it okay so alright so and then so for the shoulder we'll get an mri you're gonna see the rehab doctors and um and we'll go for and then i'll renew the um i will renew the vicodin good good and it doesn't put your liver at risk for failure so i'm glad that's improving good yeah okay good uh let's see now the vicodin do you want to pick it up or do you want it to be mailed to you okay no problem okay so let me see if there's anything else that we need to look at so what's going on with your liver are you gonna go back to the liver clinic or what okay when are you planning to do that perfect right they don't want to deal with active infection okay good so we're making headway on the fungus and then once that's under control then you'll go back to see the liver okay for the sciatica we have ya pain medicines so we're gonna get the mri as well as the neurologists you're gonna see those are the nerve doctors and you have an appointment to see them in early february but by then you'll have the mri we'll have the rehab going and see how you do with those okay the asthma is stable so that's good okay do you need any of your other medicines refilled okay now let me just look here to see if there's any other tests done okay i'll take a look at it one second we should while we're doing your blood work today i'm gonna check your psa that's that prostate test that we do it's just a blood test okay and then in terms of your medicines so you've got 4 on that 6 on that your albuterol looks like @@@ renew those uh you want to pick up you want go pick up your inhalers while you’re down there or do you want them mailed to you okay you'll get these too exactly um no i'm gonna repeat your blood pressure though are you in any pain right now how bad is your pain okay pain can cause your blood pressure to go up so on a scale of 1 to 10 how high okay so i'll repeat your blood pressure but that's not uncommon when people are having pain that makes their blood pressure go up so i'm not going to start you on blood pressure medicine because once we remove the pain your blood pressures will look fine you see what i'm saying so we take a falsely elevated blood pressure cause of pain so we want to be able to treat the pain not the blood pressure the blood pressure will normalize once we get rid of the pain okay i know yeah no that's the reason why because the pain is it's because you're having pain not uncommon to have it happen okay why don’t you sit over here for me yeah all the way down okay uh i'll probably give you a @@@ plus sometimes the machines out there are not calibrated regularly so that the blood pressure might be a little inaccurate but the main reason is usually pain okay now i'll hold up your arm just relax it okay the number is 144/82 the top number is still high but again as i said when you're in pain we expect that let me just type that in the computer i just want finishing examining you okay deep breath okay good just breathe normally okay come and sit down over here remind me have you had a colonoscopy how long ago has that been and it was done here okay so i think we have a plans for everything so in the meantime if we can figure out why you're having so much issue with your back which is also the sciatica so continue the vicodin and we'll do everything else okay they can do physical therapy with you to hopefully help alleviate the stress on that nerve and try to get this improved okay okay it's not uncommon that can happen but usually it happens with guys because they tuck their wallet in their back pocket and they sit like you know whenever you sit down the pressure compressing on the nerve and then it just causes injury and it causes the pain so that's usually that's usually the number one culprit to be honest with you your wallet being in the back pocket and then once we like tell people to take your wallet out of your back pocket then all of a sudden they feel much better but i'm not sure you know yours since yours was so severe we need i think we should see what the mri shows if there's anything else if there's something particular in the back that's still pushing on it or what what's going on okay um alright okay let me go talk to my boss i'll be right back okay uh yeah and here i can take them okay so you are all set so um i put in that order for the mri and i asked if they'd do it the same day that they're doing your back so hopefully they can accommodate that okay and then if the mri of the shoulder shows something that's you know grossly abnormal then i'll refer you back to the ortho so they can evaluate you okay um and then you're gonna get the you're gonna continue in podiatry and you have a plan for everything we just need to get these tests done so that we can see you know whether it's from the @@@ or not and then we'll we'll go based on that alright is there anything else that you need so the result of the mri the mri is typically read um about a week within a week generally after give it a weeks’ time after it's done so what i would do is just call the office here um like the next week so you're getting it done january 5th so like you would be the 10th or something and then i will look at it and i can call you with the results okay and just call and say you're asking for your mri results that's all okay and that will give me a reminder as well to look i'm gonna look but just go ahead and ask for a reminder and i'll give you a call with the results alright you're all set uh-huh yeah you too hopefully we'll get to the bottom of this huh @@@ okay all good to go thank you have a great holiday sir you have a happy new year dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/job# 1233985 transaction # 578-10-2-316-0103

done sometime next month they scheduled it; i got the letter that says next month right right uh these things that they gave me to help me with the sciatic nerve and they gave me something else and it's not doing anything a little i ran out of these and uh right now i'm taking three aleve and two motrin yeah it wasn't @@@ okay well oh okay alright and then uh could you change this nitroglycerin okay this one i was doing twice a day once in the morning and once at night right no it's an inhaler not as good it's good i couldn't have that; i took the whatcha call the sleep study and i couldn't

won't let me go back to work uh the doctor in the er because of the sciatic nerve because of the shoulder they said i shouldn't go back to work because last time when i was carrying up a sheet of drywall and then all of a sudden you know how i told you my leg would give out my leg would give out my leg gave out again and that's when we talked and found out that it's the nerve and i’ve known you now for a real long time my leg would give out my leg would give out @@@ found out why right right right well you think you can do my shoulder you know both of them at one time correct no no no right yeah it you know between the vicodin and the aleve because i was still taking the aleve with the uh with the vicodin uh i was doing alright nobody @@@ try to get everything fixed so i can get off the pills okay okay okay and that stuff that you guys gave me for the fungus is working too yes my toes have practically cleared up you know and this one is come along real good too no i'll pick

refill left okay i can pick them up sign in @@@ by the time the bloodwork is done questions all these meds that i'm taking seem to make my blood pressure right now they said it was kind of high do you think it could be this that's affecting my blood pressure just my leg it's it's up there 6 6 you know yeah alright cause you know i've never had you know i've never had you know blood pressure you

<doctor> what is your family medical history do you know what type of skin cancer she has removed date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@ are you here for a follow-up appointment you think so okay they told you to come in anything else bothering you other than pain today no headaches dizziness no chest pain palpitations no stomach aches no black stools bloody stools no pain when you pee no blood in your urine no @@@ is your stomach pain chronic pain is that what you take the morphine for okay for the pancreatitis @@@ no nausea or vomiting though okay no fevers chills did you get your flu shot today and @@@ other medicines that you said you didn't have to do @@@ @@@ good does she just do a one month prescription okay okay you're taking six tablets a day three tablets every 12 hours correct let me see what okay they think you’re good with that as sort of a pain medication kind of @@@ okay huh you can pick that up here oh it's not yours @@@ have you decided that you don't want to go to the psych place the @@@ clinic you haven't made the time yet yeah it looks like you've been going to the recreation therapy so that looks good how is that going the exercise program it's alright okay yeah you can just walk in and they can check it um how's your diabetes going your blood sugars is your blood sugar okay do you check them at home what have they been okay what do you take for your diabetes is it just diet-controlled yeah okay um then i think that's it the only thing is um we'd like for you to go to the psych clinic – you can take a seat up here we'd like to get a goal and get established in there um it looks like also that you had urine studies that were positive for drug use in the past are you still using any kind of drugs no okay when was your last use and what did you use cocaine how long ago in the last use would you say oh in march oh okay so yeah we have clinics that can help you with those things it would be through the psych addiction program yeah so if you're interested we could send you there too okay when you're ready but i would like and i also have to tell you you know no more cocaine it’s bad for you okay anything for us no did you get your flu shot today and you are smoking you are smoking how much are you smoking a day how long have you been doing that for sir a long time are you interested in quitting any time soon not ready yet the reasons why we um like patients to not be smoking is first of all it's you know bad for you it can cause cancer increases your risk for every cancer not just lung cancer if you have any kind of cancer in your you know your family you definitely don't want to be a smoker um the longer you smoke the worse it is for you and you know there are patients that you see on oxygen with copd you don't want to be one of them right so we recommend that you stop smoking and we have cessation aids and we have a clinic that you can go to too to help you with it stop smoking but first things first you have to be ready to quit or else it's not gonna work and i want you to think hard about it and we'll talk about it next time okay um if you want assistance we have the gum and the lozenges if you want the patch you have to go through the clinic okay so let me know if you're interested in any of that okay the smoking cessation clinic yeah lozenges you can get here okay what would you be willing to give a shot the gum okay you have either gum or the lozenges the gum you put it in your mouth you chew it and you tuck it in the back of your mouth and then every time you get a craving you chew it again it's dangerous to chew the gum and smoke and if you need to smoke you just spit it out and then smoke okay the lozenges same thing you just suck on the lozenges you'd rather have the lozenges okay i can give you some but remember no um lozenges and smoking at the same time sure sure okay alright @@@ it looks like all of your labs are up-to-date everything looks good okay so let me just @@@ okay do you take all of your medicines your blood pressure medicines cause that's the one thing that's kind of high did you take your medicines today you took the lisinopril half a tablet you did or you didn't if you didn't we could just keep you on the same medicine but if you did take it we'll have to increase it okay so i think what you would benefit from is um are you trying to eat a low salt diet no okay well you could try to just eat a low salt diet to see if that'll help the blood pressure but we can always increase your medicines just to help it pretty good hopefully @@@ okay if you want let me check it again how's that before we go ahead and increase your medicine well i can make sure before you leave i'll refill everything and i'll mail everything to your home okay i can give you some oh you're sinuses what do you normally do for your sinuses i could just give you regular normal saline sort of a salt spray @@@ you're right; i think it was because you were walking around no it's still high it was 150/90 a little lower does that hurt at all is this okay okay alright i will be right back okay alright sir this is what we're gonna do um i’m gonna increase your medicine the lisinopril to 40 cause your blood pressure is still high on it uh and then the low salt diet we're going to check your urine today to make sure  my boss wants to make sure that we keep getting consecutive tests that are negative for cocaine and then um i'll give you those lozenges and for your pain medicines so i know you're taking three in the morning and three at nighttime @@@ same release of the morphine the thing is the prescription lasted you for three months now so uh kind of what we want to know is how much are you really taking every day um that way we can prescribe what you need oh i see so when they get bad you take them okay well @@@ down here so um you take it like the three in the morning and three at night when he has the pain but he doesn't have the pain he doesn't take it at all okay okay back on july 29th you got enough medicine to last you 30 days where you took three in the morning and three at night but that prescription has lasted you until october now so you're not taking it every day which i'm happy with that you're not taking it that's what i’m trying to figure out how often you're taking it but you don't take the morphine every day right is that correct okay how about the immediate acting there’s a long-acting medicine and a short-acting medicine how often are you taking the short-acting medicine you're not taking that at all or you need to help us out here first of all no more cocaine that's number one off the bat okay three months! i mean three months was the last time i filled that prescription so somehow you made 30 days of medicine last for three months you must not need medicine that much okay how long have been doing that i don't want you taking morphine every day if you don't need it you got it i don't you to rely on it you’re already using cocaine and doing cocaine i don't want you to get addicted to this medication okay got it we'll go ahead and give you a prescription the same prescription as the last time and then don’t use it if you don’t need it okay and seriously i'm going to check @@@ if you keep having problems with cocaine you're violating our narcotic treatment program and i can't give you narcotics so please don't use cocaine not only i can't give you the medicine it's bad for your heart it causes heart attacks okay okay try not to it’s tempting @@@ to people that are @@@ and then um you can always call if you're running low on your morphine and let me know okay so i know i know no you definitely we will give you medicine when you need it just call in for it but i guess i'm not even allowed to give you more than one month at a time anyway yeah uh-huh this is for you um let me give you the smoking lozenges in the mail or do you want to pick them up and these are actually the month's worth all you do is call us for the refills okay yeah you just call the number that's on the bottle and then um tell the number that's on the bottle the prescription number and they'll give you your medicines in the mail so call like a week before you run out call in for refills because it'll take a little bit now let me get this so the medicines are renewed your lozenges are on their way and we'll increase the medicine and send them out actually you know what is it okay if you pick this one up okay oh you want to pick it up okay let me change it to pick up then okay so what you're gonna do is you're start taking your new medicine um then you're gonna come back in three weeks with the nurse here and then they'll recheck your blood pressure on the increased medicine okay uh then

<doctor> how may i help you possibly we will see just gotta ask a few questions first and we'll we'll do a physical exam as well afterwards but certainly we'll look into what is causing your symptoms so you mentioned a cough when did that exactly start okay and have you had a cough before yeah i see and uh with the cough are you producing any phlegm or sputum okay have you noticed any blood alright and have you had a wheeze alright and have you had any uh chest pain with the cough alright uh and you noticed that your voice is voice changed and that was about 3 days ago as well okay and uh any triggers for this like were you at any events that you had to be uh kind of speaking loudly or talking a lot or anything where you're straining your voice okay yeah so it sounds yeah just sort of came on on its own alright and have you had any like eye redness or discharge or a runny nose okay with the runny nose what what what could you describe the uh mucus that was coming out and has that gone away now and then when was the runny nose i see and have you had a sore throat or do you have a sore throat alright is there any pain with swallowing food or liquids okay um and have you had any fevers or chills or any any night sweats and any changes to your weight recently okay well that's great and about how much okay well that's good and um have you had any nausea or vomiting how about any abdominal pain any uh diarrhea or any urinary problems have you had any muscle aches or or joint pains okay and have you had any loss of your taste or sense of smell okay um and any skin changes or rashes okay uh and um so you've been experiencing so you had a runny nose that's gone away um and now you've been having this cough for the past dry cough past three days and lost your voice yesterday have you been experiencing any other symptoms alright in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions that's great and u have you been um have you had any allergies before okay and uh do you take any medications regularly okay and uh are you aware if your immunizations are up to date okay um is it do you have a plan to get that one or okay well that that's a good idea for sure so it's great that you have a plan for that um for that yeah it can be really helpful for preventing cervical cancer as as i'm sure you'll talk to the with the family doctor about yeah and have you had any hospitalizations or any surgeries okay um where about are you living right now and who are living with has anybody else been sick or have similar symptoms okay and uh how about anybody at school or or work or anything like that that you've been around who's been sick okay and um have you traveled anywhere outside of the city or province alright and um in the home is there any uh like are you exposed to any violence of any sort like physical or emotional either yourself or or witnessing okay and what grade are you in oh awesome and uh i don't is there any smoking in the home okay um and then um anybody in the family uh have any heart or lung conditions okay um and i sometimes people that kind of in this age group might experience with either drugs or alcohol have any of your friends done that or or yourself okay that's good and um i that's all i wanted to ask today on history was there anything else that you wanted to add yeah so uh right now it's sounding like um a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords uh with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago actually this reminds me that have you i'm not sure if i asked about fevers or chills if you have any okay um and so for if it is a viral infection then um it's just supportive kind of management so that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um next few days and then also you can use things like if they help like lozenges or something along those lines um but it will it will just take some time for it to come back on its own a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes and the cough could possibly last for um two to four weeks after um after having a viral type illness yeah so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for but since you're having a cough and these symptoms could overlap with covid we'll want to get a covid swab today as well um and kind of go from there do you have diabetes or blood pressure problems alright date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ oh there you are sorry about that i wasn't looking at this chair how you guys doing come on back come on in alright good to see you again it's been a few months i know yeah okay okay oh well you know why because we only do that high dose monthly vitamin d for three months but then it's supposed to go to weekly let me just see what we need yeah if somebody is very deficient in vitamin d we put them on a high dose pill once a month for a few months no you know what we do we do it once a week for a few weeks and then we'll go to once a month you never were on once a week oh let's just see what we had did i prescribe this for you or did you get it from one of the other doctors do you remember not the kidney kidney folks you know it looks like your levels are actually and you just had them done and they look normal let me just it looks like they've come back up so we may be able to put you on a lower daily dose rather than worry about this high dose stuff let me see here yeah i think we could probably move to a daily how long have you been taking that monthly vitamin d has it been a long time okay just that one tablet a month well i mean if it's working oh so it was uh okay so we'll just keep going with it then i don't want to change the uh you know you want to just here; do you want it in the mail okay okay no it's rare to overdose on vitamin d yeah um okay so that's in okay yep we'll go through all of them let's go through all those but first just to check in are you still taking your blood pressures at home okay so this was your new one you just got like a week ago or so you're a little high overall a little high yeah and they had suggested that you so you're taking the valsartan 160 mg in the morning and then what are you taking for valsartan okay so you take two in the morning how come you're not taking them in the morning they told you to take those at night we have written in the note that it's in the morning that's the only reason i asked right right that's so that's the reason i asked because what they suggested was that instead of taking that extra valsartan if it's high you change it and make it a different medication that's faster acting that you can take if you have a high reading called hydralazine it's another blood pressure pill it works very quickly so it'll bring you down faster like you said the valsartan doesn't work quickly so i think what we should do i don't know and it should be oh they don't put that on them well i can @@@ okay so after breakfast okay let me check it with my list here alright so amlodipine you're taking the one in the morning and then your furosemide you take in the morning metoprolol you take a half twice a day good and then allopurinol you're only taking every other day i don't even have that on here oh yes i do do you get that from us no maybe you get that one yes that's probably what it is and then after lunch you have a gabapentin okay and then another one in the evening okay then you have the valsartan at okay and your aspirin and then another valsartan and you have the simvastatin at night oh the vitamin d and then you have you're um your pain pills the vicodin as needed okay uh-huh sure has okay yeah that's you know for allergies we can get you some new ones not a problem yeah that should be fine and then you can get this stuff over-the-counter but if it's easier we can get it for you it's called you'll see it over-the-counter as zyrtec um and it's for itchy eyes runny nose these types of things um you could take one a day which is probably what you were taking previously do you want a prescription for this okay let's put that in then let me get that sorted out do you want to pick it up today or do you want it sent out oh my goodness oh wonderful oh yeah so it was just your birthday a couple days ago huh how exciting so you're going to the chicago symphony is that the oh how fun my parents used to have season tickets and they were in the um seats that are like around the back of the orchestra so you're looking down yeah oh it was fun sometime you guys should try the tickets there cause it's really interesting to be right in front of the conductor and you get to look down on the percussionists and it's a completely different view and the sound is in that place is great everywhere oh yeah its awe i mean it's such an amazing place okay so that one's in and then i have on here that you have an albuterol inhaler do you still have that one do you take it as needed okay okay i think what we'll uh it's not on; it's not on your list it's on mine though and you still have it i think what we should do is have you take the valsartan um 160 mg in the morning that after dinner dose i think you should move it to your after breakfast dose are you okay with doing that because that's what they have written in your kidney doctor notes that you're taking it in the morning and i don't know why that got confused um but usually it's better to spread out those doses so that it will work for you so take the two of them after breakfast you know what i think probably what we should do is maybe bump you up to having you just take two in the evening yeah that's kind of you know what it doesn't really matter that much um you know usually with a medicine like this that you take twice a day we space them about 12 hours apart because that's the amount of time they usually work so if you get up and you eat breakfast at 8 o'clock and you take your medicines at 9 then take it probably before bed at 9 but if you're a real early riser and you're taking them at about 6 okay okay so take them after breakfast and then maybe before bed i'm gonna change it so that you do yeah i and i know they'll probably i'm trying to think you're running a little bit high um well under under 140/90 but your top number's usually higher than 140 so you do have a couple in the 100 110 reading we don't want you know those low ones to go any lower so you're not you're not really far off goal you're not so high that i want to make a lot of changes so maybe instead what creatinine went up a little bit so yeah okay so maybe that's the only change i want to make today is to really change the time of that dose and see if that helps um cause i'd hate to add another medication and have you go any lower we don't want to see you get too low because then you can start seeing things like dizziness or yeah yeah right i'd almost rather you be just a little above goal then to worry about falling oh i'm it's a terrible feeling i mean so 150s-160s but with some lower values in the 100s-120s we'll give you valsartan after dinner 160 mg and also before bed either 80 or 160 mg okay how are you feeling overall are you feeling okay okay so you're not having low blood pressure where you're actually getting real dizzy or lightheaded okay that's great that's good and then the vicodin is controlling the pain okay you have the arthritis pain is that right uh-huh oh that's good okay that's a little strange hmm have you tried ever anything else i mean that's a pretty good pain medicine but maybe the shoulder we're seeing a little more inflammation i don't want you to take any yeah oh okay good oh you did okay you saw an orthopedic doctor okay okay are you doing okay with the orthopedic doctors there or did you want to see someone here okay okay okay alright so we did the medicines um and then you have your allopurinol you get at target the aspirin baby aspirin you take we looked at that one and then your eye drops it looks like and you get that from someone else oh really @@@ uh-huh hmm oh well that's good that's a lot better isn't it hmm and they tried to get them and they wouldn't give them to you here hmm hmm right i know yeah well if you fax me a prescription from your eye doctor i can try to get them here if i have prescription i can try to put it in @@@ well that's a lot better yeah maybe we can have yeah it makes it much easier i think ours are 8 oh they're 9 they all went up yeah well we'll go through your lab tests real quick your vitamin d as i said it looks okay a little low still so we'll keep you on the same thing that the kidney doctor wanted um i'm sure they talked to you a little bit your creatinine is elevated as you know no i think they're just observing like keeping away from any medications that could make it worse and i think controlling the blood pressure as well as you can is the best thing blood counts look fine no problems there no anemia anything like that um urine looks good electrolytes all look fine we talked about the creatinine cholesterol looks good no problems with that and the liver oh really simvastatin oh and now they're you're at 20 are you getting your 40 mg pills now you are supposed to be getting 40 oh well that's that's annoying but it's fine if you want to use those up i know it's annoying to cut them in fourths the next one you get should be a 40 mg pill so you'll only have to cut that one in half right but the cholesterol levels look really good your liver function looks completely normal and your iron is normal too your iron level so everything looks actually really pretty good um except for the kidney function and we talked about that already so keep going on that and then make sure you have a refill gabapentin you're taking basically two capsules a day is it easier for you to get 90 day supplies of things let's change that then some of these are at 30 or 60; i don't know why they do that so the next time you should get 90 day supply we'll give you three refills so you don't have to keep calling metoprolol oh that one's a 30 day supply see i don't know why they have it let's give you a 90 day supply of that one too and then hopefully it'll last you a little longer it looks like pantoprazole has been renewed that's the one you take for the acid reflux it's been renewed simvastatin that's a 90 day yeah yep yep so you should have at least you know right i can only do a 30 day supply amlodipine let's give you a 90 day supply of that one cause you're on a 30 day supply okay um i don't think i don't know that there's a limit i can give you as many refills as you want you have two right now they took a little bit of the tylenol out of it is what they did well you know the stronger drug in the medication the hydrocodone was not changed and they decreased the tylenol because they're finding that higher doses of tylenol can cause liver problems along down the road so having less tylenol in there is less harmful to your liver but it may have taken away some of the pain okay i've given you a bunch of refills of that one so you'll have enough albuterol you have plenty of refills on your inhaler pantoprazole was already done lasix the furosemide you have a lot of refills but it's only a 30 day supply so let me make it a 90 day supply and we’ll havet everything to be 90 okay and valsartan you only have a 30 day supply so let me can change that one so this will basically just mean that the next time you order it it should be 90 days worth which will make things easier you don't have to call as often and then the calcitriol oh yeah well that's true hopefully we won't be making too many changes and then the calcitriol wait were you still taking that one the calcitriol i don't think it's another type of vitamin d actually you had two times weekly is what i have on here and then the big vitamin d we already and your metoprolol it's showing me has expired calcitriol this guy twice a week you're on that one it's yeah sometimes when people are low so i mean i don't think i was the one who prescribed that for you oh so was this this is from your primary doctor okay oh but you made this yeah oh yeah this is good okay no that's okay cause we have most of this information in here but it's good to have that with you yeah so let's get you some refills then if it's you know it seems to be working and the metoprolol we've got oh wait that one twice 0.25 micrograms it's a different kind of vitamin d um it works differently i can't tell you all the mechanisms but make sure i am telling you the right thing you know i think it's because of the kidney disease if i'm not mistaken i did that one twice so let's sign all those and these should be all refilled now it's telling me why are you beeping at me it's telling me you had side effects to furosemide before is that true you’ve been taking it for awhile @@@ okay alright so i have that all straightened out let's do an exam and make sure everything looks okay have a seat up here what time is your concert today okay i'm gonna retake your blood pressure just to see if it's gone down yeah i know and you took all your blood pressure pills this morning good about 152/72 uh-huh yeah oh well that's terrific i'm just going to peek in your ear oh that's helping a lot yeah that's great you've got some wax in there i'm going to look for you can put them back in yeah that's why i don't really want to give you more blood pressure medicine because you have periods of time where you're normal 120 we don't want you to be a lot lower than that i mean then we'll start seeing some dizziness open wide for me say ah good and lift the end of your tongue good take your glasses off just for sec i want to take a peek at your pupils here okay you can put them back on let me take a quick feel of the neck here oh maybe a little bit of a lymph node on this side so do you have a little bit of this side maybe maybe that's why it's a little different do you have a removal on that side okay long time ago a couple deep breaths here good alright go ahead and lay back for me look at the belly i'm going to untuck you for a second here have your bowel movements been normal no blood or tarry stools black stools yeah i think we talked about that last time you were here how often are you getting it now and it's still sort of late in the day sit up for me wait one more test for you lets check your strength here toes up in the air you've been getting them less frequently push down and kick up push back a little shorter okay this thigh up in the air good and this one ooh you okay got the hip huh i'm sorry about that give me a good squeeze okay pull me towards you now push me away good arms up like this nice and strong yeah you got that the shoulder huh oh this one okay pretty good strength though good go ahead and relax can you shrug your shoulders up okay can you put your arms up to your sides a little stiff okay go ahead and relax good puff out your cheeks all the way out like you’re blowing a candle there you go stick your tongue out and to the right to the left let me see your teeth good now squint your eyes closed real tight for me good open them up feel the same on both sides of your face okay chin to your chest like this and head all look at the ceiling a little stiffness in the neck a lot of stiffness in the neck can you turn your head towards the door and resist me turn your head keep going good and that side good okay need a quick listen to your neck and then we'll be done here turn back towards the door there and hold your breath okay let it out turn towards me and hold your breath again okay good alright go ahead and sit back down do you have any trouble with your stools when you're having one of these stomach episodes okay and does anything tend to make it better or does it go away on its own so it's when you're up and about oh i see okay and then when you get up again do you just feel better i see okay yeah i remember you were having more problems with them okay @@@ okay so they're working that up with your primary care okay just let me know you know what happens or if you need us to do anything here okay let's just make sure we're up-to-date on all our other health stuff um have you had a colonoscopy in the past yeah yeah we don't there's a certain age at which we stop doing those yeah so i don't think we need to worry about it i was just wondering if there'd been one done because of the stomach pain okay so okay and then let's just double check where we have with the immunizations flu shot pneumonia tetanus and everything is up-to-date so good and did we ever were you a smoker in the past did we ever has anybody ever looked at your um aorta do an ultrasound of the aorta we usually do it for men who've had a history of smoking again you're probably over the recommended age where we tend to do them but we usually start them at 65 um and just check and see if that big vessel in your belly has dilated at all do you ever remember having that done i'm sure you have okay i think you're over the age we usually do them but i'll double check i don't show it in ours no that would've been it was the thing like they use when a woman's pregnant yep then that's probably what it was alright we reviewed that i thinks that's all and you have all your lab tests done with us right do you get any blood work done outside okay so we'll keep doing that we'll do some checks in six months and make sure everything is looking fine so and you're getting some blood tests done with the kidney doctor but i think let me just see when that is ordered for you yeah yep so i'll double check and you know if nothing's been done in six months we'll just kind of update everything but it sounds like they're actually following you pretty closely too with the blood tests yeah good um and i think we talked about everything else um i just have to run everything by my attending before we let you go but is there anything else you wanted to bring up or any concerns you have okay okay okay good well let me just go run everything by her um maybe now that you have your new one and we'll start the we'll start the valsartan try a morning dose and see if that makes you a little more stable throughout the day 160 in the morning right depending on what you see in your blood pressure okay well let me just go double check everything with my attending might have another suggestion so i'll just be back in a few minutes okay okay sorry that took a while yeah i know we talked last time that maybe it wasn't wasn't really doing much for you and we were gonna see how it went you were put on that for the arthritis or for do we really know okay well did you feel like that was working do you want to try to get off the gabapentin i mean if you're not having a lot of nerve pain then we can you know with the numbness burning tingling pain fingers toes shooting pains that go down the legs into the feet or down the back into the buttocks um um sort of like um more of a burning inner pain than uh like a no i think you have to call when you run out even but i think which one did you run out oh i see what you're saying um so the cetirizine you'll get automatically because it's a new medicine the other ones i think what i did was just renew and so if you find that you're getting low on the pills just call them and say hey i need them by next refill you have plenty of refills now and you'll be getting 90 day amounts @@@ i was going to ask you that gives you one less pill to take we could see sometimes gabapentin makes people feel a little tired i don't know if that's been a problem but it might give you more i don't know so so we could give it a try the way we do it is you're taking 300 mg twice a day what i would suggest is we usually taper it so you don't stop cold turkey um take one pill for about a week just to let your body get accustomed to it and then we can probably stop it completely you're not on a very high dose we can actually have gabapentin can be a very high dose for people with a lot of nerve pain but with arthritis we don’t really see a lot of nerve pain we see more of an inflammation pain an achy pain and with nerve issues we see a lot of people with diabetes or things like that and you don't have any issues with those types of things so you can give it a shot cut it back to one and if you start to feel like your pain is getting worse then by all means we can keep it on there there's no real side effects or toxicities to gabapentin so if its of the gabapentin yes you do it can cause some sleepiness vicodin can cause a little sleepiness too the vicodin pills can do that so so you know try it and see how you feel if you don't notice any difference after a week just stop stop the medicine completely okay um and then you don’t have to call i'll keep it on your list for now just in case but you don't have to call for a refill if you're not using it obviously and so the next time you come we'll discontinue it completely if you're not taking it okay right uh so its its for allergies that was the new one it's you've heard of it as zyrtec yeah that would be a 10 mg pill that you can just take one time the vitamin d that one should be on its way if you don't get it in the next week call them call the pharmacy okay cause it should be coming you have a little time you said you took your last one on the 15th so call them in the next week if you don't see it in the mail okay and the zyrtec just take it you know once a day if your allergies seem to be worse when you wake up in the morning take it when you get up in the morning and it should last you throughout the day okay uh it should start taking effect in the first half hour to hour you take it yeah um and you can use over-the-counter stuff too if you have a lot of which one was that oh just oh well bring it in next time if you want to talk about it cause i'll need to see what ingredients are in it and we can talk to the eye doctors about that okay yeah allergy pills can sometimes make you a little sleepy they can also make you feel a little bit dry cause so i don't think so i think this one is a good one for the daytime um let me just see i'm looking at the side effects there are like some of those decongestants out there they recommend you only take them at night um so yeah some people can be drowsy so see how you feel you can take a half also of this medication if it works you can just have a half 5 mg uh and see how that goes okay any other questions for me okay well just call me if anything comes up okay i'm only in here for one week and then i'll be @@@ four weeks and then i'm in @@@ and then i'll be back in five weeks so i'm here one week out of every five is how it works now but i still get my e-mails even when i'm in the hospital and i can give you i can call you without a problem okay so they'll schedule you for my clinic um what do you do you come every six months to see me is that right so that'll be around september time and like i said we'll look for some labs i'll look at the labs and see if you you know it worked well that way because then we can go over them when you're here so plan on a couple weeks for the blood tests let's see uh yes yes they're not going to @@@ a little disconcerting i know they're doing some constructions right off the oh you're welcome take care you guys have fun at the symphony today i hope you have a lovely day here's your folder and you check out with one of these nurses people at the desk here okay bye @@@ i don't think i can make it that far i don't think they make an appointment that far ahead you'll get a reminder letter okay yeah you'll get it like five months before the six months okay </doctor> <patient> hi um i'm here because i i had this cough for a couple days and now my voice still hasn't recovered it sounds really hoarse and i can't speak as well so i was just wondering if you can give me something for that that started three days ago um like before the three days you mean um no i was pretty healthy before then no it's pretty dry no no uh no nothing like that no yeah that so well no actually that started about yesterday yeah yesterday in the afternoon um no no i wasn't i was like i had school i came home i didn't do anything like that i have had uh i've had a runny nose before but no eye discharge uh it was it was clear yeah that's gone yeah that's gone that went away but like um yeah two days ago maybe um i have so it hurts because i'm coughing but it doesn't seem like it's my actual throat no no no um i've had some weight gain over the past like six months uh just maybe like 5 10 pounds 5 to 10 pounds somewhere around there no uh no no no uh no no nope nothing like that um no no other symptoms uh no i've been pretty healthy no uh i just take some multivitamins uh so i have everything except for that hpv vaccine i think so i'm just uh waiting to follow up with my family doctor about that uh no i live uh with my parents um and my two younger siblings we live in a house uh no no one at home's been sick so one of my friends actually had like a runny nose and a cough as well a couple of days ago but uh she seems to be better now and her voice is okay no no not recently no i'm in grade 7 or yeah grade 7 now uh no no one smokes at home heart or lung i know um like heart disease runs on my father's side of the family i'm not really sure like exactly what what kind of diseases though i know like some of my friends have uh tried alcohol and try marijuana but i haven't experimented yet oh nothing that i want to add i just what do you how do you think i can make this make my voice better and how long will i have have this horse voice uh no i haven't okay okay okay that sounds good thank you yes i have hypertension but no diabetes here alright yes it has i don't like this system i used to make appointments now they you get on at six months anyway i was just looking this list over and this one is missing the vitamin d and i'm out of them i have the one i take for the 15th but that emptied it and i called them in and they tell me they're gonna get to you and get permission and call them back in a week but really i was once a month always no no uh uh it was a doctor here i don't know i've had so many @@@ or what's that gal's name that was the pharmacist i don't know oh good oh i would say at least a year yes yes yes i still i just took the one the 15th i took one and so i got a month to get it there's no overdose problems and there's a lot of these that you better check cause they're down to one refill i really have fun trying to get them when they run out that pharmacy joke yeah i got a new blood pressure machine here because i think and it starts here and goes on the back page because the other one was way off yeah i'm running at 130 you're talking about every once in a while i'll get down but uh yeah okay that was just friday no i take valsartan 160 after dinner i take 160 two of the pills then at bedtime i take either one or two depending on what the blood pressure is at that time i don't take them in the morning cause i'm taking them when they told me to for years well i think that'd be a lot smarter because it doesn't work very fast for instance if i take it at dinnertime the blood pressure you'll notice on there the blood pressure goes up at night every night and after i've taken two of these so they must be very slow acting uh-huh why don't they put on the bottle when to take it none of them do not a single bottle tells us when to take them this is what i take when yep yes yes oh wait a minute maybe i maybe that's the one i get at target cause it's four dollars and then that one on the other side it's the that was the vitamin we were just talking about okay now what i have i have a three year old bottle of i wrote it down i'm having runny nose and itchy eyes you know spring has come early and this is what i used to have uh and also on the bottle i've gotten written for itch i haven't seen it is that for is this another one my kids have cats so i really have a problem so what i need and they're three years old so i was afraid to take them but i'm wondering if that's what i should be taking now well put yes please no that's why i'm all dressed up; i'm going down to the big city for symphony for my birthday yes it was like yesterday but i've had three of them so i yeah three nights of it for a celebration oh i wanted that we've never sat there we'll have to do that sometime yeah we sat on the last row in the gallery it's wonderful it is yeah yes yes and i only seem to get wheezy at night usually every night i'll have to take a couple of puffs of that is that not on there no well i don't show it there okay you say take two cause i get 80 mg okay and then when do i take the next one or two so two in the morning and two in the evening when you say evening are you talking bedtime or you're talking dinnertime well he's not an early riser any more would you write that down please i am is there any way they can put that on the tab because not a single medicine there and uh yeah i'm running i never get 90 the second one yeah 140 @@@ well i even got a 103 here 103 46 142 but then it's 122 19 10 then 160 146 165 150 maybe it won't be high if i take them at the right time yeah because the creatinine got high she wants another blood test in six weeks right he went through a period of that now if he takes two pills it’s been so erratic @@@ it's hard to change the medications he really feels lousy when it's low yeah no i haven't had that and i haven't had any swelling either well it's funny how that it does the back and hips really good i mean plus the fact that my family doctor i see every six months gave me some exercises in the morning back exercises and that so i really i was always taking six vicodin and most of the time now i take four but if i can't sleep because i'm in so much pain but the vicodin doesn't work for the shoulders it seems to work from here down and that's strange isn't it no well i just when i had my six month with the family doctor and he gave me a cortisone shot he wouldn't do the other one because he wants to see if it works and it worked so i may go back and have another one but i had the right shoulder replaced that was eight years ago and it's the worst but and i was trying to get an appointment with that guy and i don't know they don't answer their phones oh yeah the one that was it here the one that no it was at the hinsdale hospital hinsdale orthopedics for both my back and both knees have been replaced too no i got enough doctors yeah after this doctor here i wouldn't take them which made my eye doctor mad cause he was involved somehow with the hospital here and so i went to her and she said you got to quit him and bring all your files to me it was a woman downstairs here and i said all i wanted to do was get the medication and she said nope won't do it eye drops so i was paying well i just went generic it went from $97 a month to 12 or something crazy wow so it's uh and one of them is about $40 and one of them is $20 i went to canada to get one of them nope now any other time like my heart doctor's recommendation and he would fax it here and they would you know whoever would i've had five of you but they automatically would put it in the heart doctor did that and i don't know that my family doctor well it's down to you know $12 yeah it's not worth doing now i don't think but uh well you give me three capsules of course i don't know what that would cost outside so many of that stuff is in the $4 list now at the drug store but i don't know and you uh i think they're 9 now they were $8 now they're 9 which is alright but when you're only getting three pills i don't know yeah but i didn't get the point there was anything i could do about it that's what i'm surprised that's as good cause they cut that down i'm cutting out the pill i have in quarters yeah what does it show here yeah well i probably have 80 originally i was taking a half of that i haven't gotten any yet because i got them once but i had so many left over that i'm cutting up and i've been taking those and you cut that in half yes i don't know either has it been renewed because that's the one that ran out and how many but you're putting that in for some more refills because we figure what you're six months now the one you can't do for six months is the vicodin how many refills can you give me on vicodin well somebody said they could only go for four refills or something that changes and i don't think it's a good as it used to be i don't know what they did to it did that affect it yeah it doesn't work as good yeah i don't use that as often it makes it easier until you change the medicine and then i've got 90 days of it what one calcitriol what is that he might take that i don't know look on our list what's that what did you call it well i'm taking it yep oh my gosh and you're taking the once a month as well gee that's a lot of vitamin d that's what i'm doing no he is my primary doctor i made this also because everybody asks me these are all the operations and do you want a copy of it but does that clarify this cause i take what's there i take how many milligrams is that vitamin d oh is it okay no no no i haven't had any side effects from furosemide there was another one that i did have side effects with i forget what it was i think that it was one that i was taking when i was before i had that tumor removed what's that kidney i forget 1:30 when is it 1:30 i think it's gone down since i walked a half a mile you know since they changed the parking it's really a hike yep yeah see that's unusual too cause usually when i take those pills i go over to the health club and i ride the bike for a half an hour and i walk the treadmill for ten minutes and when i get home i take it you know i walk in the pool sometimes and uh when i get home it'll be in the 120s so the exercise must be helping but i notice uh yeah put you back on the air ah one of them was removed i don't remember which side cause i was about 30 years old and i'm now 87 so that was a long time ago yes nope a stomach ache every once in a while that nobody can figure out yeah my family doctor said i should have a test at the hospital but well i think about two or three weeks apart but it wasn't as severe last time only lasted four hours instead of 12 i've had them last from after breakfast i would get it on sunday so i didn't have to go to church and it would last until 11 o'clock at night i don't know if they're less frequent there's not as severe yeah careful of that the right one that's as far as they go yes a lot of stiffness no well it doesn't hurt when i sit and it doesn't hurt when i lie down so i go back to bed i don't get up until it does get better but they used to last 11 hours almost to the time but now i had a slight one yesterday when i went to my family doctor and he set up and i'm sorry i didn't write that you wrote it down but you wouldn't remember it what test he's giving me but there's a lower abdomen he's wondering about a artery blockage or something so i'm waiting for the hospital the la grange hospital to call me to go over for a test that he called for but i can't tell you what it is because the name is unbelievable it's not something simple thing like lower stomach check okay yeah i used to take company physicals every year that was a long time ago i haven't had one in 20 some years well that's what my doctor said depending on what he finds he may want to do more so yeah yes i've had so many tests i don't know that that was one of them you don't show it in your records cause i did something here but i don't remember what it was it was one of those it's a little round yeah i don't know if that was here or at la grange hospital but i did i had that no yes she said six weeks they're very good at that no no i think we've covered everything yeah you've done a good job covering it today who is she yeah i'm confused too because i think i been i don't think the blood pressure machine has been correct maybe it'll i hope that one's correct although it was off yesterday when i took it and you've got uh 160 in the morning and either 80 or 160 at night yeah okay you know i wouldn't know unless i quit taking it well i was going to a pain doctor and at one time they were gonna install they tried that device where they put the wires up on both sides of the spinal cord and then you have a remote control controlling vibrations and if it worked it was on the outside and if it worked they were gonna implant it and we got to that stage and then i had that angina attack and they had to put in a splint and then they decided they wouldn't do that at all uh actually i quit using the outside stimulator because i didn't it helped when i had the severe pain but the vicodin started handling it and the exercise started taking care of that pain pretty good so i what's nerve how nope don't have any of that alright there you've got that set up they're not sending all of these automatically are they okay but i the one that i ran out of was okay so maybe i should quit the gabapentin and see what happens yeah yeah i fall asleep reading the paper alright i'll i'll cut it back to one and see if it makes except sleepiness this is one of the things that bothers me yeah okay okay alright cetirizine so what does that do is that the new one the one you were adding oh that and the one that i'm out of which was the uh vitamin d okay yeah the 15th is that quick acting sometimes my nose runs all day long yeah there was one i read that said if you have glaucoma ask your doctor before using it and that was the one i got at cosco they called it an allergy pill they don't have a name on it allergy so i haven't wanted to take that and that made me sleepy if i remember i have yeah is this what i'm getting also make you sleepy okay i actually feel great that's a joke you're only in here on hmm so check your e-mail okay uh-huh yeah yeah i usually have blood tests before @@@ you don't have anything to walk on @@@ thank you thank you thank you very much and they'll make the appointment that helps yeah okay

<doctor> welcome back to sample clinic mister sample what seems to be the problem today sir how long have you had this pain when is the pain the worst does it get worse throughout the day what treatments have you had for this where is your heel pain do you have any change in your medical history since your last visit do you have any flu like symptoms that or vomiting or headaches what about chest pain or shortness of breath </doctor> <patient> good afternoon doctor i'm having a lot of pain in my right heel um it's been about two weeks now honestly it starts with the first step first thing in the morning yes it gets worse all day with activities well nothing to date it's on the right heel then it's on the inside bottom part of the heel and into the inside of the heel no it's the same old same old like fever or chills oh no i don't have anything like that thankfully no nothing like that </patient>,True,1,True,1,True,True
<doctor> are you allergic to any meds yes are you sure okay great! </doctor> <patient> me no i am not yes i am damn sure </patient>,False,1,True,1,False,True
<doctor> what brings you in here today ok and what symptoms started first ok and then this when did this sneezing start ok does she have any coughing at all ok for the last two to three days ok is she at all coughing up any green or yellow material or any blood at all ok so and are her symptoms constant or do they come and go ok and have you been in contact with anyone at home or at school if she's going to school versus at home for the pandemic right now but any ill contacts at all ok any anything that you've tried that has helped her like any over the counter cold medications ok any other symptoms like fevers chills shortness of breath um anything like that does she behave like herself like is she more tired at all more irritable anything like that ok any recent travel at all any headaches nausea or vomiting ok any chest pain that she's described ok any changes in her bowel movement constipation diarrhea ok any urinary problems ok any issues with their sleep or appetite ok uhm has she lost any weight recently ok any exposure to any allergens or like fumes dust animals ok has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok any allergies to medications that you know of is she on any medications ok any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past ok any family history of any lung or heart conditions or anything else ok does has she lost a sense of taste or smell at all ok did you feel any pressure in around her face at all ok uhm any issues developmentally as she was growing up like to meet are all our milestones at an appropriate age so no no issues or no complaints at all ok in our immunizations up to date ok and were there any complications at all during your pregnancy with her or after the pregnancy ok and currently who does she live with ok and does anyone smoke in the house and i think that's all all the questions i have do you have any questions or concerns ok so yeah based on her symptoms she does seem to have some just a cold like symptoms viral symptoms and it's been it's been you said three or four days in total right yeah and so most likely it's just caused by a viral infection like common cold perhaps it she doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now so and no signs of like a bacterial infection that i would be concerned about that i would give antibiotics for right now but definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath increased coughing with producing more yellow or green material and if she gets more feverish so will also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well but yeah some of these things you just look out for but yeah so that that we'll do the physical examination and go from there hey you're welcome

about having a runny nose and has been sneezing a lot over this past over this past week i think the symptoms maybe started three or four days ago i think the runny nose is what what started first and like kind of the nasal congestion she was telling you that she felt that there was like pressure or congestion in her nose surely after that probably maybe the same day or or the next day yeah so she she did start to cough actually after that so that the cough has been there for the last for the last maybe two to three days it's a dry cough no nothing like that they've been pretty constant and they've gotten a little bit worse since they started three or four days ago i i think now yeah her symptoms are at her at the worst right now just not feeling very well well she has been going to school there hasn't been any covid cases where she goes and they've been cautious but she is going to school right now uhm uh no uh she did feel a bit warm to touch and has looked a bit flushed in her face just doesn't look like herself yeah she's been a maybe a bit more maybe a bit more tired and and a bit more irritable but not not too bad she she missed school today but went yesterday no we've been at home uhm no no chest pain no that's been normal no she had a urinary tract infection when she was like little but hasn't had any since she has been a bit a bit fussy but she's been sleeping ok no no no she's been gaining weight well no i can't think of anything like that we don't have any pets at home and she's she's been hasn't been going anywhere else no she just said ah just yeah had a urinary tract infection when she was younger and that's about it not that i'm aware of no no uhm i i have high cholesterol but and ah and i'm taking a a medication for it but no nothing else no she hasn't said any anything like that just the nasal congestion uh yeah well yeah i think so she doesn't say well no pain but does feel like a bit of pressure with the congestion i think she did yeah she has met she was walking at the appropriate times and able to talk and does work really well in school and is social with with her classmates and peers no there hasn't been any concerns i feel that she's been developing normally they are yeah no it was a vaginal delivery at 38 weeks and she was a normal weight we were able to go home right away with with no complications so yeah things were good so myself and my and my husband uhm my husband does smoke but uh i mean he smokes outside usually and and he smokes i don't know maybe a half a pack a day nothing else right now yeah yeah alright thank you family nope yes ma'am okay it's been a long time oh yes and no odds and ends well so far so good i uh no not really i uh just got back from arizona i spent eight months over there uh they got me here with some medication that i couldn't get here but i got it over there why i don't know i try yes ma'am well right now i'm trying to go twice a week i used to go three times but uh the last 2 1/2 years i don't know if you remember but my wife had those strokes and she had another one in 09 that's why we went to arizona for the winter last year and uh we had to come back here because uh medicare we had to be here in illinois we just got back here in december which i hated it to come back there's one medication i came here a couple of weeks back that one of the doctors wanted canceled uh well i don't pronounce those words yeah because of my nose it breaks out i get uh blisters and uh this was recommended by dermatology now when i this doctor said it's no good it could cause problems later on well as long as nothing pops up on my nose i don't take it sometimes i take three times a week sometimes twice all depends when i see my nose breaking out that's when i take the medication uh what does that say 200 100 yeah yeah but i've been taking half of it i've been taking half of it right i should have brought the bottle now this here this one here medication yeah uh was given to me because a couple of times i find myself uh wet at night the pajamas or i couldn't hold it so i stopped at the va over there in arizona and they says no you don't have an infection it just could be your bladder and i've been taking that too as i need it now one thing i don't understand uh the va hospital as far as i understand regardless of where they are you should honor the other place their instructions or whatever i was there and i didn't have no problem they registered me right away uh i went to the hospital; they assigned me to a doctor i came here and i ran a couple medications and they wouldn't give them to me they said no no you have to see a doctor yeah but if i i can see if i'm out completely that i have to renew it but if it's still good the bottle says renew a couple of more times or whatever why when i why isn't that particular medication that i'm telling you about my nose oh and then he only gave me enough he gave me nine pills only like i say i take that when my nose breaks out no you cut me off its cheaper buying over-the-counter yes that's alright i can handle that one no i'll get it uh the uh the softener you did good cause they canceled me here one time and then i just noticed i still got it here now the other medication that i'm taking is um like complex vitamin b and stuff like that those were recommended by the cardiologist and i'm still taking that yeah the one medication that is uh the one medication that i don't have here yeah and that baby's expensive and i been taking that since i had my bypass i had a uh blood work over there and i'm always concerned about my prostate and according to them it was real good it was 1 point something no it's not i don't have it here i'm surprised yeah wait a minute wait a minute that's my wife's list i thought i had everything in order 1 mg this again i take it three times a week four times a week because it's expensive see the metoprolol i got it here as a half uh i had coffee and a roll yeah my cardiologist yeah in fact i should have had a stress test a stress test i haven't seen him since two years ago or three years ago and i call him up he says yeah come in and

<doctor> would you mind by starting with what brought you in ok is your nose still running ok and could you describe the discharge is it clear yellow greenish ok uh and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils like it's obstructed ok and have you had any changes to your sense of smell ok have you had any changes to your sense of taste ok and have you had any cough or sore throat ok and the symptoms have gone on for five days have you had a period of time where you got better and then got sick again ok and you have pain do you feel it in your jaw or do you feel it in the in the front of your nose ok and do you grind your teeth at all at night or have you had tmj issues before ok so no pain in your mouth or anything like that ok have you had any fevers or chills ok and over the last few weeks have you had any weight loss ok and you said you didn't have a cough or a sore throat but have you had any wheezing how about any shortness of breath i see ok and have you had any chest pain alright and any lightheadedness or feeling dizzy ok have you had any nausea or vomiting any abdominal pain have you had any diarrhea have you had any diarrhea ok and have you had any urinary problems and have you had any rashes or skin changes ok then how about any muscle aches or joint aches ok and have you had any muscle weakness and how has your energy been any fatigue ok and uh sorry to go back to this i don't think i asked did you notice any discharge from your eyes or any eye redness ok have your eyes been itchy ok alright then do you have any medical conditions that you see a physician for regularly ok i see and any medications you take for that ok do you take any other medications over the counter prescribed ok and do you have any allergies to medications or like environmental allergies that might be getting worse ok so you don't experience any symptoms like this when the seasons change ok uhm and what was done at that time ok i see any recent hospitalizations any surgeries alright and could you tell me where abouts you're living currently and who you're living with ok and anybody that you've been around who's had any symptoms ok so no sick contacts and have you traveled anywhere out of the city or province ok and any of your coworkers have any symptoms or any coworkers being off sick i see yeah that's great ok and do you smoke cigarettes oh that's great it's not easy to quit so that's awesome and do you drink alcohol i see ok and do you use any recreational drugs ok uh and anybody in the family have any lung or heart conditions alright and how about any cancer in the family ok i think i that was everything i wanted to ask about today was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure i knew about today yeah so well certainly check your temperature to see if you have a fever and if you do and it's high enough that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis and if so with some of your symptoms including the discharge obstruction loss of smell and facial pain that all fits the picture for it and also you had a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again so that might require antibiotics but we will check your temperature and go from there thank you yes it is probably sinus infection and then cough secondary to that infection yes it is date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hello how are you doing today yeah i'm hungry too so no lunch oh gosh oh no why is that oh oh i know i know we'll they're trying to change things so i'm gonna be here for at least another two more years so it's a little bit better than getting a different doctor every time okay right okay so let's just kind of start from the beginning um let's go through your medical problems so you have diabetes how long have you had it a long time okay okay and before we get into each of your problems i want to try and go through your medications and some other things uh do you take glipizide for your diabetes who gave that to you was it someone from here but let's see what she did for you right right so you're on metformin one tablet twice a day and then uh glipizide yeah you were supposed you were on 5 mg and then she's gonna increase you to 10 right and she was going to increase you to 10 if your um 2 hour post meal sugars are not less than 140 um okay yeah okay viagra yeah okay right sure yeah sure understandable and you're um and your metformin i'm gonna renew that that since that has expired um your glipizide needs a refill and the @@@ uh-huh diabetes not looking so good so your glycosylated hemoglobin is 9 let's see what it was in the past so it was 7.2 just as early as january 7.2 is actually not bad the goal is less than 7 9 is really high so let me ask you have you been able to take all of your medications okay right so you were on actos so the only thing she did was she stopped actos sure alright let me just look right yeah let's see so let me look at her note and see right so she stopped your actos and switched your glyburide to glipizide okay so really the total effect is that you have a little bit less medication on board now um let's see when your next appointment with her is you know you're supposed to see her three months from your last appointment which was january 26th and you don't have one scheduled so i would actually call her clinic and try to schedule an appointment we can probably increase your glipizide to 10 and i'll check with my attending too cause you're already on that metformin 1000 we can also increase that as well but uh right right right okay well i wouldn't get too stressed about it just yet um you know we can increase the one medication and see how that does there's a lot of other medications out there so you don't have to take actos although it does work well um let me ask you a few more questions so and the @@@ you take 5 mg every day right one tab uh-huh right uh and let me just ask you some history questions because i've never met you before uh do you smoke cigarettes good um how much did you used to smoke okay (doctor sneezed) thank you uh any use of illicits like uh marijuana cocaine okay and are you working okay what did you used to do alright and who lives with you at home now do you do your own cooking or do you eat out so you feel like your diet is pretty good oh really awesome alright and how about exercise what kind of exercise do you do so you retired recently okay okay and any alcohol use okay have you ever had periods in your life where you were drinking a lot more than that yeah okay alright any family history of any cancers okay okay gotcha now for your diabetes do you follow with a foot doctor at all uh-huh and the eye doctor have you ever had any eye tests done right let me look at your last one so we basically with any patient with diabetes we screen for retinopathy so let me see you did have a test done in 2010 um and it basically said that you did not have diabetic retinopathy but your exam was abnormal cause you might have macular changes does that ring a bell @@@ okay and you were supposed to be sent to optometry okay so maybe i'll put in a consult um uh-huh okay right okay right now have you ever been on medication for your blood pressure okay um sure alright do you get flu shots yearly you choose not to okay alright now have you ever had the shingles shot is that something you are interested in okay i can order that for you today you just get it once hm hmm well because we don’t give it to people until they are older anyway when you’re younger you have immunity from chicken pox have you had chicken pox there is also something called psa; that is the prostate enzyme and you had one done in 2010 and it was normal at 0.88 so it is up to you if you would like to follow that i would not recommend it unless you are having symptoms of you know problems urinating or it is probably from the diabetes but it could also be from prostate enlargement sure so if you want we can follow it the psa as well i can order it for the next time you come in @@@ and we will make sure it is not rising alright and do you know if you have ever been screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm no you have not or @@@ okay so for anybody who is a previous smoker and male we do one screening test after the age of 65 basically it shows us an aneurysm in your belly right we have to document that we talked to you about this and that you’d be willing to do it at some point okay now um okay so i'm going to have to talk to my attending about a couple of things in terms of your eyeglasses um and then getting you in to see the eye doctor and then your diabetes medications um and then i'll order your shingles shot as well right right alright let me have you sit up here for me and i'll get you examined i'll listen to your neck first okay just going to listen to your heart alright deep breaths in and out through your mouth alright can you open your mouth and stick out your tongue okay i’m just going to feel your pulse okay do you mind taking your shoes and socks off for me we'll do a quick foot exam have you ever had one of these tests done monofilament basically what i'm gonna do i'm going to have you close your eyes and i'm going to poke you in six spots and you need to tell me which toe you feel it in yeah i'm sure you have anybody with diabetes needs to do this especially if you're not seeing a foot doctor we do it at least okay relax your leg for me completely relax it okay alright close your eyes and tell me if you can feel this where well you got to tell me which toe so below which foot can you tell where this one is okay okay is this usually where you have your numbness in this area okay right direction yes okay relax your foot your left don't look can you feel this you feel it but you can't tell me where okay okay oh boy oh boy yeah can you feel my fingers here and here okay oh my goodness okay yes i'm going to go talk to my attending and then i'll be back yes i just put it in they don't let you pick it up unfortunately they'll send it through the mail yeah right absolutely hey okay a few things so um i'm going to put in a referral to the eye clinic for you i don't know what they can or can't do but we'll see um and then for you're feet i'm actually going to put in a referral to podiatry as well even though some of the abnormalities on your exam may just from the history of you know the trauma to your feet but i do want them to take a look just to make sure um and then also you're um for your diabetes call the clinic today and tell them you were supposed to be seen in three months and hopefully they can get you in sooner but in the meantime i will increase your glipizide to 7.5 twice a day the reason for that is because we don't you haven't been checking your blood sugars at home right so what's the story with the glucometer cause i'm looking in the notes and it looks like two months ago she had given you a phone number to call oh really do you want that number again maybe you should okay right so i'm going to do i'm going to change it to 7.5 um so you can actually pick that up maybe at the pharmacy today um oh sure sure sure you are allowed to do that and then the other thing um right okay that's not a problem 7.5 so you are taking right now you're taking 5 mg twice a day so you take one pill twice a day right right so you would take 1 1/2 twice a day or you could wait for five or six days until you get the new medication sent to you so there's no confusion well because you've had the dose already once i give you the 7 1/2 let me see what happens when i do that one uh kind of you're supposed to uh you're supposed to take it twice a day because of the way it works so i would not recommend you taking it that way but let me when i order it um okay 7.5 so yeah it's going to make you take 1 1/2 tabs twice a day that's the only way they don't have 7.5 tabs yeah so you cut one in half and take half in the morning and half in the evening you have to take it that way because of the way the medication works you can't take too much at once and a little bit you know at night because your sugar is going to change and vary as well yeah i just ordered it so even the different ones they're gonna make you take one and a half cause there's no such thing as a 7.5 pill here at the va um now i wanted to ask if you'd be interested in talking to the move clinic i don't know if you've ever done that before so basically um it's a clinic where they discuss it's kind of like an exercise program but they also discuss diet and okay sure and then the other thing i wanted to talk to you too about is that your liver enzymes are slightly elevated and it looks like if i go back they they’ve always been elevated but not this high so they're kind of going up a little bit will do that yeah so it could be from that and the other thing we can do is do a liver ultrasound to make sure there is no abnormalities on that any cysts or masses or um any fibrosis okay so i will order that for you as well uh-huh have you had any pains okay let me order your shingles shot as well you can do that today correct you should have that within a week and i want you to call that number to get another glucometer and if you have any problems call back here and we can try to work on that um it'll be the same exact thing that you're gonna take starting today but it'll say on the bottle 1 1/2 uh-huh alright i'm going to order this uh uh-huh alright so let me see if i can find a nurse who can give you the zoster shot i'm actually going to have you walk out here with me alright she's going to help you out with the shot you get today and then she'll get you scheduled with your ultrasound for you i'll do all of that there's a clinic who will call you and can get you in alright take care i'll see you in a few months okay </doctor> <patient> yeah so over the last week i've just been feeling some symptoms it kind of first started with like a runny nose that was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion like around my nose and like my throat and now over the last two days i've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so i've been getting a lot of pain there as well yeah i'm still getting some discharge and i also feel like i'm getting some dripping at the back of my throat too especially when i wake up uh it's fairly clear and sometimes like a bit white but like it's not like green or yellow yeah so at night sometimes i have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side so yeah i do have some obstruction yeah so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad i started losing the ability to smell no taste is fine uh no no cough or sore throat i did kind of have a runny nose last week as well so probably like 8 days ago but then the runny nose discontinued a little bit but really got worse 5 days ago but all these other symptoms just happened in the last few days yes i would say mainly over the cheeks it can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well so like i would say like mostly around the cheeks jaws and up to the front of my teeth no nothing like that i think it's not so much on and around my teeth it's more so just to right below my nose above my teeth and just around my cheeks no not inside my mouth uhm i don't think i've had a fever i did feel some chills over the last few days but just very brief episodes no no wheezing uh not shortness of breath just sometimes when my nose gets like really congested i just turn into like a mouth breather but that's about it no no chest pain no nope no sorry what was that no diarrhea uh no no not that i know uh no no uhm it's been mainly ok just maybe sometimes difficult to get to sleep with all the all the congestion but i don't think my energy has been affected too much no not discharge but yeah maybe a little bit of redness uhm yeah a little bit i would say they have been a bit itchy uh just uhm its called dyslipidemia just like a statin medication no other than that i take multivitamins uh no not that i know i don't think so i have had this happen to me uh i would say like once before it happened like two years ago it was pretty similar at that time it kind of just went away on it's own it got better i feel it's definitely worse this time but at that time i didn't even go to the doctor it kind of just went away no hospitalizations nope yeah so i'm currently living in an apartment by myself just outside of london uh no not that i know of no i've tried to stay home besides going to work i just work at the grocery store besides that no nowhere else no we're pretty careful right now with the pandemic no i quit just a couple of years ago just maybe like red wine a couple of times a week uh just in a month maybe once or twice i smoke a joint no not that i know of uh no no cancers no i think that's all i just didn't know if i needed any like medications or if i needed to get tested i just wanted to make sure alright sounds good thank you so much yes hi how are you nice to meet you okay a little hungry i haven't had anything since 10 o'clock last night peanuts well i had to fast for my blood tests and then i went to eat and there was nothing i could eat everything's you know closed up downstairs other than stuff i didn't want to eat i get a different doctor every time i come so i got now i haven't had my diabetes medicine since yesterday morning so i mean that's any difference in my blood tests here i can't take them without some food yes uh i don't even know anymore uh yeah probably uh five or six years five years let's say they just changed my one medication from actos i was on actos for years but i talked to the doctor last time and i told her you know everything i hear is something about bladder cancer with actos so she changed it recently so i take the metformin well i was taking three different kinds of medicine well she got me off the glyburide i think yeah i take well geez i don't know the name of the new one she gave i just got that recently i don't know her name right i was concerned about the actos so she changed me so instead of taking three different kinds of medicine a day i'm taking two right right glipizide is that what it is i don't know i take two of those a day okay i've been having trouble with my meter lately so i haven't really been checking myself i'm waiting for a new one so she's looking for 40s 140s two hours after i eat alright i'll keep that in mind and i couldn't take a urine test today because i just got when i walked in i went to the bathroom cause they usually don't ask me for that they just usually ask me for the blood work so i didn't uh i didn't do that part of the test or lab work plus i was on the uh levitra and they changed it to viagra that's another thing i want to talk to you about because i got to keep calling this in every month and they gotta ask the doctor to refill the prescription i want that prescription refilled so i don't have to keep doing that if you would do that for me please every time i call they say it's not refillable and i want it to be refillable 100 mg please oh yeah plus i'm taking the thyroid medication too how's that looking on my blood work and how about my diabetes how is that going yeah well because i was on the actos before that's probably the problem she might have to up the uh that new one she's giving me metformin and and gave me the new medicine but i was taking three different medicines now i'm taking two so apparently the change is not good cause i was consistently around 7 before on my on that with the actos i was just a little little high before with the actos and i don't think i've been that high for a long time maybe i better go back to the actos yeah but when i call it's gonna take probably at least two months to get in i'd like to do something about this medication now well she told me that it was a low dosage of the new medication she was giving me and if there was a problem she would increase it but obviously something is not good oh maybe i should have just stayed on the actos i don't know i take uh two of the metformin two of the other one whatever that is two of the other diabetes medicines and the one thyroid pill no i quit 3 1/2 years ago two packs a day bless you in my youth yes not for many years no i'm retired i was a surveyor nobody yes i do my own cooking yeah i was a cook in the marine corps for three years so i'm a pretty good cook yeah i walk but i'm not just lately within the last year probably i've kind of slacked off more than i should i'm gonna get back with it here pretty soon now that the weather's warming up i was riding a bike and walking every day of course as a surveyor that's all i did i walked all day so when i was working uh a couple years ago yeah yeah i have probably 6-8 beers a week something like that that's all no hard liquor oh yeah when i was younger yeah my grandfather died of lung cancer my father died of emphysema my mother heart disease i'm the only person in my family with diabetes i get a little money from the va for the agent orange from vietnam no i had a claim in for neuropathy in my feet and they gave me 10% of the one big toe but i broke my foot at work years ago and it's the va's claiming that that's why i have pain in my other foot which is a bunch of crap but they don't want to pay me so that's why they say that eh…before my insurance lapsed after i retired i had a prescription for glasses my eyes are getting weaker too i don't know about the va's policy on glasses cause i can't afford to go to an eye doctor right now so i need i wear reading glasses right no i never heard anything more about it after that test i need a new prescription for my glasses and you know they gave me i went to you know a regular eye doctor before because i still had insurance till a year after i retired and they gave me bifocals and i can't wear them i can't stand them so i need uh i probably need glasses i need some new glasses and uh not bifocals but yes definitely my eyes are getting weaker i can tell just by sitting at the computer or reading no my blood pressure's always been pretty decent but i would like to bring that back down closer to 7 than 9 on my diabetes you know that's not good news i'm not used to hearing that no i choose not to i got one and i got sick one time that was it for me i had a bad case of the flu probably oh three or four years ago i had it real bad was really sick for a week five days i was in bed no yes my mother had the shingles and i certainly don’t want that how often do you have to get a booster for that that is it you’re done lifetime shot wait a minute how old do you think i am yea i had everything german measles measles chicken pox you name it i had it all i have a weak stream sometimes i don’t know if that is from the diabetes i don’t have any prostate problems are far as i know i have erection problems because of diabetes that is why i want to make sure you give me the prescription for the @@@ well that is up to you i mean what do you think @@@ well right right i mean i take a blood test anyways so i don’t see any harm in it also i will take the urine test the next time i come in too no i don’t think that i have i am 63 i am going to do it yes yeah like i said here if they have to i know just by phone to get in to see the doctor it takes at least a couple of months and i don't want to wait that long for the diabetes medicine you know if that's worse no oh yeah i've it done several times i had a lot of i have some numbness it's relaxed i can feel it bottom of my foot it doesn't feel like my toe it feels like my foot below my i don't know i mean i can't tell the little one i think big one below the bigger one or second one i don't know no it's on this foot well yeah i got it on the big toe on here on this one a little i don't know which toe second toe i don't yeah this is the one i got crushed this foot was completely crushed i had a four inch steel pin through my big toe i had no joint in that toe okay i got it completely crushed i cut the severed the tendons in between my first two toes there i had a puncture wound on top of it and my whole foot is yeah yeah here's the numb part is right here i was run over by a machine that weighed tons yeah the big toe on the right foot is the problem but the circulation seems to be okay i don't know are you finished okay yeah like i say you're gonna give me the prescription for the viagra so i don't have to keep calling in no they mail it to me oh that's fine it's just that every month that i call they tell me it's not refillable i just want it to be refillable so i don't have to go through that plus i'd like to get my diabetes medicine straightened out as soon as possible too yeah i called them and i'm still waiting yeah i'll call them again what now the medicine that i'm taking should i take more of those than i already have just have them mail it to me because i have it at home now can i just take more of what i have yeah because i just got a new prescription for that how much do i take which is what how many pills two pills i take yeah one and a half i don't take four of them three of them how many do i take if i take three of those a day it'll be the same thing right or i could take two in the morning and one later on during the day maybe something like that three total for the day in the meantime you're going to add you're going to give me a different prescription right what's that's about no i know what to do i just got to get off my butt and do it i think i had a i cancelled that one time a long time ago no i know what i have to do they were before too i think and i think okay and the doctor told me that that thyroid medicine could be a problem let's do it she told me if i had any pains in my side that to stop taking that thyroid medicine i had a little bit when i first started taking it nothing real serious but i've never had any trouble with my liver before as far as i know okay so i can go ahead and increase this the diabetes medicine and you're going to order me a different dosage right okay okay now the new prescription what that'll still be 1 1/2 that'll still be 1 1/2 okay okay i don't like to hear that you know i thought i was getting the diabetes pretty much under control here because i was always right around 7 that doesn't make me too happy to hear that it's up to 9 even though i don't really know what i'm talking about with these numbers but it's i had my heart checked and i had an ultrasound done on my chest and all that stuff before not my liver now i never really have any pain like i said when i first started taking it thyroid medicine i thought i felt a little dull pain a few times but nothing severe and i haven't had it for a while so okay oops i forgot think i dropped my glasses i got my glasses here and the glasses and the whole

<doctor> so i understand you're having some chest tightness ok for sure so you said it started about 3 days ago have you noticed it's been getting better worse or about staying the same ok was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it ok and when it came on three days ago what were you doing ok now when you're walking you say you have some chest tightness do you have any chest pain ok did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all nothing like that ok and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all ok and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area ok and since then that happened when you were out for a walk how many times does it happen a day would you say ok so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days but it's more noticeable if not worse when you're going for a walk ok have you had any cough at all in the last little while ok any fevers ok any night sweats so waking up and the sheets are soaked any chills any unexplained weight loss at all ok and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before ok so you have asthma do you use any puffers at the moment ok so you don't have any anymore of the as needed but you have used it in the past ok and you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either ok uh what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night have you just been doing well without it ok understood and then have you had i should have asked do you work currently ok got it i suppose just has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do any missed time from work so it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning but it's noticeable ok now is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma ok how about we just talk about your medications a little bit what are you taking currently yeah yep ok understood so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else ok do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past ok got it and just in terms of your life itself so do you smoke at all ok so no smoking any other recreational substances drugs ok got it any allergies that you have ok and so nothing new in the environment you haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog ok so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness and aside from that seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors but you've kind of been limiting the some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much ok alright john i think i've got most of the information i need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations i have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now barring any other new findings so i think maybe what we would like to do is we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks and if they don't help then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next does that sound good john no it sounds well i suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise more sounds like a chest tightness and you haven't had any pain associated with it so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential but of course we're going to try one thing at a time and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that ok no problem ok i'll go talk to the doctor i'll be back with you in a moment do you live alone aw what kind of cats are you currently working congratulations on your retirement how long did you work as a psych aide incredible one more question do you smoke drink or use drugs recreationally always great to hear date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ so it's been a long time i think it was back in august right so how you been doing what's that great how long has that been going on for what uh started it yeah so how'd it end up going any withdrawal symptoms or anything uh-huh really so we'll just have to do that i know i saw that yeah are they @@@ or do i need to call them alright if you don't hear from them soon will you call them cause i do want you to do that um let's see so @@@ what medicine do you need the hydrochlorothiazide your pressure looks good do you want them sent to you did it help but you do want it refilled okay yeah did you have a procedure there or not i don't remember so is the meloxicam not working you take it every day alright do you want to try that or do you want to try something else i don't have you on the trazodone yeah i saw that really it says here in august that you were um; you were enrolled in that social work homeless program right @@@ it says that @@@ oh you have your own place now okay last time you saw mental health was ’09 do you need appointment to see them or do you just need to call okay um which uh medication did you want right i'll do that the aripiprazole okay i will fill that one the aripiprazole just to let you know with one refill but um i want you to see them cause they manage those okay cause i don't want i mean i want to make sure that you know they still want you on that we need to see them again i don't remember having you on the trazodone let's see i know but it doesn't even come up in the computer probably because you haven't seen him in a while do you still take it when was the last time you got it yeah what did you take it for you still need it okay what else do you need you and me both you have no complaints okay um any chest pain or shortness of breath diarrhea headaches vision changes blurry vision double vision nothing yeah weight changes or night sweats you're not gaining weight how have you been eating well how's your diet i mean is your diet healthy you know well this last note from the gi people the colonoscopy that i wanted you to do said that um they're waiting for your call and call them please whatever you want but let's do that okay um and then um no and then you're gonna @@@ let me know it's my attending that they need to actually formally re-request these through the mental health or you can just call them i don’t actually know that but otherwise you're feeling okay right the hydrochlorothiazide the trazodone and the meloxicam but we're going to try something new for because that's not working really well so there's no reason to continue it you had that ear wax before is that better the hearing is fine um and then so not checking the levels @@@ you had the hep c uh do you still see the liver clinic ever for the liver clinic when is your appointment at okay so is she gonna call you for the yep and what was the did you have a history of iv drug use okay what did you use @@@ i wish i would have known you were getting your @@@ cause there are some @@@ and other blood work um just like blood count and stuff like that you don't have to do it today um but i'll put in yeah it is yeah this is all the liver okay but just baseline cause i want to check your um so have you eaten today nothing cup of tea with sugar what time @@@ so come back for the when you're fasting next time you're here for an appointment if you like there's no rush but maybe in the next couple weeks or so lipid profile and then complete blood count that's just a routine check you know to make sure did you have your flu shot do you want one why no alright okay okay let's see have we done your psa before prostate it was in 09 so let's do that again uh well actually do you have any urinary symptoms any problems urinating or stuff like that the recommendations are +/- some people say check it some say don't check it you're not having any symptoms and this one was normal yeah you're list is short for most of my patients it's long @@@ there you go okay so you're going to follow up with mental health you're going to follow up with liver you’re going to follow up with the gi guys for the scope and you're going do the liver um you're going to do the mental health and you're going to do the gi and liver are going to do their part so you have two and they have one so hopefully three upcoming things for you okay we'll refill the hydrochlorothiazide i'm going to check with my attending about changing the new one for the meloxicam since it's not working yeah bone on bone yeah how's the winter been for you you haven't gotten sick at all or anything like that open your mouth and say ah for me you a bears fan we stopped them well what do you think about name what do you think about that whole thing do you think do you think they told him to not come in yeah @@@ you don't think he kinda limped out a little bit i just don't like his attitude that's the problem you know and that's not a good quarterback that's not a member of the team deep breath breathe out breathe in again good lay back for me you don't notice any water in your legs or anything all in all he just you can sit up @@@ i just don't like his attitude and then he thinks he's getting the shaft but i think part of the time the problem @@@ by the way he carries himself yeah but roethlisberger played on a broken foot name would have come in with his arm in a sling okay you know yeah um are you still smoking so what what do you want do you a patch or do you want the gum or do you want how about the patch well let me know which do you want do you want to try to do it yourself and then if it doesn't work let me know okay so let's do that good okay those are good girls your labs are back and your liver function is a little high @@@ yeah you do @@@ it is going up @@@ 120 130 one the enzymes in your liver so you know yeah the last time they checked it was in june of 10 and it was 120 and now january @@ it's 159 so not great but i mean the rest of your liver enzymes look pretty good so that's good yeah it is hang on so we'll see we'll see what they say let me go check with my attending real quick uh i think you are @@@ agent orange @@@ i’m sorry they don't uh-huh okay let me go ask him about the mental health and the meloxicam and @@@ hey okay so well this is done in your knee it can be so here's what @@@ we could do @@@ i think you should probably see pt again for your knee because strengthening the muscles surrounding your knee is the best way to support your knee and decrease the pain um you saw them once before right when was the last time it's been a while ago right would you be interested in doing that or no right so what do you think alright so i'll do pt and then have you ever tried that capsaicin cream has it worked for you not at all how long did you use it for you should give it about a month for it to work do you want to try it again and the problem is that after like month beyond this the next thing we do is vicodin or like narcotics and someone with your history but you know what i mean that's the problem you know we're kind of running into a brick wall well i'll write you for capsaicin i'll write you for meloxicam again i'll just refill it the trazodone i'm going to let the mental health and you’re good to go see them and you need to make an appointment it's been less than two years since you've seen them so just call so you need to call gi guys and mental health and liver is going to make your appointment for you and then i will put in the lipid profile and cbc in the computer and um get those when you've been fasting for 12 hours so that we can do those to check a cholesterol so okay blood so those will be in the computer next time you're around get those done and then um that's it i'll see you like six months unless something changes are you going to be here sooner you can do whatever you want give them a call for that thanks okay give this to them as you check out </doctor> <patient> yeah it's uh for the last maybe three days um it's not really pain not in any specific spot it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when i breathe in especially and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when i go for my walks which i do everyday uh i try to walk my dog so i was just you know worried that it could be something serious and i wanted to come and get checked out i think it's staying the same no nothing in particular um yeah it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady uh i think i first noticed it when i was gone for my walk no there's not there's not pain it just feels like when i breathe in it feels tight uh no i can't say that i did uh i i feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath um so yeah yeah i guess kind of just all over well i feel like it's kind of always there but it gets worse when i go for my walk um and well sometimes i go for more than one walk right 'cause i walk my dog it's always kind of there and especially when i'm like getting up out of the chair i can feel it more or when i take a big like a big breath in as i said exactly uh no like i feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm like i'm clearing my throat more but i haven't actually been coughing no can't say that no no no nope uhm i mean i have asthma um so i've had some trouble breathing before it this feels feels uh different than other times i i guess it could be related but uh i don't know this this feels a bit different that's why i wanted to come in and get it checked out yeah i just use the one that um i take every day i don't really use the uhm the one thats as needed because i just haven't had to in a really long time so i didn't refill my last one yeah exactly like it's been a couple of years since i needed that but i still i still take the daily one no i always take it um so i'm supposed to actually take it morning and night um for a while though sometimes i was skipping the night one because i didn't feel that i was needing it um so so lately i've been taking it everyday but i've just been taking it in the morning exactly like i haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when i was just taking it in the morning i i haven't had any problems uh i i i'm a financial advisor i'm like semi retired so i do some stuff from home i haven't missed any work but i'm not i'm not doing a ton of work right now i don't think it would stop me it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me maybe this the last few days it's kept me from i usually go on a couple of walks a day the last couple days i've just gone on one usually so yeah it's a little bit yeah exactly yeah uhm i have uh high blood pressure i don't really see my doctor very much i just am on um medication uh i take the uh salbutamol that we talked about and i take um ramipril and uh sometimes a tylenol if you know if i have a headache or something but not very often no no no nothing major just the asthma but you know like i said it's been a few years since it has bothered me no never oh no no i mean i i have um you know a few beers on the weekend but i don't do very i don't do any drugs and i don't drink much other than that uhm no no like i uh when i was younger i got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime but other than that i i like i it's really been uh many years since i've noticed that exactly yeah like just the morning was it was enough sounds great i'm just you know glad to know that it's probably not my heart sounds great thank you thank you i wouldn't say i live alone i have three cats and they always keep me company two persian cats and one chartreux i retired a few months ago i used to work as a psych aide for the state of pennsylvania thank you thirty two years i drink wine every now and then i used to smoke back in the day but i'm five years smoke free i do not do drugs alright yeah @@@ fine i quit drinking i said i quit drinking about a month and a half now i quit about for 20 years i just got back on the juice bottles you know na not really i need some medications refilled you were going to send me the pill for smoking i never did get that i missed your test too i already got it once and then when i was going to take it this last month then i got the flu and i had to cancel and they were supposed to @@@ they said they were going to call me okay yeah and pardon me yeah and my trazodone yeah and my trazodone and my other psych pill and uh meloxicam and i don’t know if it’s helping me or anything like that it's supposed to be for my knee pain ah @@@ anything yes i still got pain in my knees that's because i just don't have no cartilage in there anymore no they just told me to exercise it i don't think so i mean most of the time @@@ i was yeah but i'm out of it now so let's try something else if you've got something @@@ you know i haven't seen him either and they were supposed to give me an appointment but they never have uh yeah that was @@@ no i'm living by myself now i was with my cousin yeah uh i got my 100% compensation no well actually i'm living with my daughters now and renting them a house so they have a place to live with my daughter yeah that's what i'm saying that i don't know i usually see him out in aurora on a computer screen i was seeing him here for a while for the blood pressure trazodone and there's another one for my psych @@@ or something yeah the cigarette pills which one okay i think i still got like two yeah yeah yeah yeah well he had me on that yeah i'm out of it hmm oh probably last year some time sleep yeah i'm up three times a night @@@ other than that i've been feeling good no no headaches every now and then but that's why i'm doing boxing good that's the thing you know it doesn't bother me not to eat probably better for me @@@ yeah i mean i cook for myself but the kids i usually fix their meal oh okay alright i'll plan to stop over okay i thought they were going to call me okay i'll make arrangements okay yeah yeah it never has cool yeah uh-huh uh i just gave them blood today; i should have done it @@@ @@@ she said she was get hold of

long time heroin crystal dope you name it i've done it doc you know but i'm clean today i haven't touched a thing for three years oh yeah put it for next time whatever is due you know yeah i thought i was doing the blood test for name this morning but yeah okay yeah no well i had a cup of tea yeah and milk oh what’s that all about no no because i don’t really get sick okay now that i've moved in with my daughters i've been getting sick cause they work with kids you know and they're always sick now i'm pretty good what's that yeah i think i don’t know @@@ @@@ yeah for all the shit i’ve done i’m… yeah my one woman doctor down there is the one that told me i'd pickled myself @@@ i'm embalming myself so i don't know yeah right yeah yes yeah alright the knee right here i've had them look at it there's no cartilage left in the knee now what it does you know it just pops every now and then and i hear it pop it's not doing it right now but nope ah yeah but i knew green bay was going to kick your ass man i just knew it he's getting the shaft i think yeah well not only that but you know it's not all his fault man we need an offense to do anything you know and then once the doc tells you you can't go in you ain't going in and you know @@@ not to you know well yeah he did i think i mean i do but maybe next year well he bums everybody out you know he sat on that bench and pissed everyone off you know no no i know yeah @@@ you know he's shown that a few times already too you know that's where uh yeah i mean they say he's soft but i don't know where the acl is in the knee i imagine it hurts yeah i mean look at all @@@ yeah then they really messed up when they put that second quarterback name they should have put name in for him but the offense really sucks; we got to get an offense a little bit yeah i'm down to less than well about a pack a day now i can't chew gum i got dentures the patch i tried but it didn't work @@@ you said you wanted to give me two of them @@@ i'd probably be able to do this on my own yeah let's do that you know i'm managing to quit all my other shit and i'm down i mean i was smoking about 2 1/2 packs and i'm down to oh yeah about a pack little less than a pack a day now and i can't smoke at home cause my girls won't let me smoke in the house other than that i don’t know everything has been okay you when i talked to name she said i got a little bit of scarring on there what's that oh is it still going up now that's not good huh yeah @@@ quit drinking so you think you are going to get hold of mental health or am i i need to go downstairs to i think don't i so i can make an appointment with them oh yeah well years ago back in the 70s i was tested down in arkansas and i had but now they don't take it anymore do they they don't there's no claim for it anymore and they don't test for it anymore do they not that i know of cause i've always wanted to fight them on that cause my daughter's missing her five fingers on her one hand you know @@@ okay doc sure what's that the meloxicam shit @@@ @@@ yeah yeah he told me i mean he told me exercises @@@ because putting in a new kneecap is @@@ specialist uh i guess i'll give it a try yeah no oh yea no only used it for a couple of weeks sure they don't want to give me vicodin yeah yeah that's fine i mean i can deal with it the only thing is it's hard getting up and down oh

<doctor> hi how are you i am so sorry tell me about your back how did you land when you fell i would like to get some imaging done today good how are you so you had the colonoscopy everything went well as far as you know good news um anything else bring you in today i'm seeing all the patients that i saw on the same day in my new patient clinic today and you're gonna follow up here most frequently and you are down to a pack a week of smoking right there you're over okay what do you do you want any help as well i gave you the gum already but you just haven't used it yet (laughter) okay so you'll continue to your blood pressure is high today um well we can repeat it we'll see @@@ is normal for you so hmm okay @@@ it's a little high i’ll check @@@ okay so you're normally on @@@ too i don't think i have the latitude really to really know your white counts a little high but that might be normal for you you know everyone is a little different i think it's probably just something we'll have to watch um kidney function looks good so it can just be a matter of you know modifying your medicines your ldl is really low like almost too low the ldl is the bad cholesterol i want it to be low but that's really low um your lfts are i remember looking at them before were fine let me check iron studies you're not anemic okay um i have to check on because of the colonoscopy that's why okay and you're oh you're on the you're on crestor we ordered simvastatin right now you're on that your hemoglobin a1c is high um but i think we need to just recheck it today and how often are you when is your next appointment with the pharm-d yeah the pharmacist so they didn't change anything at that time though so we'll just recheck the hemoglobin a1c this time get the labs right across the way then i’ll get them today because of the holidays i think the big thing we need to worry about is your blood pressure and why in the world it's so high inactivity okay everything is supposed to be a little bit but i think what i probably would do is go up on your hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril combo pill um i don't want to go up on both medications at once @@@ on this too because i don't want to bottom you out either how have you been doing though have you been feeling okay no chest pain or riding your last bike do you feel great still do alright and january 1st huh you and the rest of america (laughter) yeah go ahead and take a seat up there i mean you are really like you're at your correct weight and uh you're doing all those things correctly so so let's actually repeat your blood pressure and make sure that it's you know high as what they're saying it is cause sometimes you know just walking into the doctor's office people shoot up (laughter) holiday season i don't think it's very relaxing season i don't know about you yeah alright you can actually relax your arm though yeah i got higher so it's high so i don't know if i really want to go up on both cause what i could do is i could just double your combination pill right cause you are only using one of those then kind of the max the most effective dose of both of those pills is actually 25 and 40 which would be two of those tabs once a day um you know with your blood pressure being 150 um i would be inclined to maybe either; i think you're probably safe doing that do you have a blood pressure cuff at home okay that's something we should also get you because if you were taking it and you feel lightheaded or funny for you it can be one of two reasons right either your sugar is low or your blood pressure is too low so you can check your sugar and we should give you a way to check your blood pressure and then the reason why you're not exercising as much because of the weather are you an outside exerciser biker okay i think um they have a program called move that is supposed to help you with exercising and staying active is it so much that you don't know what to do or are you just @@@? kind a have been falling off the band wagon okay so we need to get you back on there um if you drop a few pounds start eating a little bit better restrict your salt i bet you probably won't need to increase the blood pressure medicine the last time you were here your blood pressure was fantastic so i'm a little bit um less inclined to you know go up so drastically so i might do is just add um i might just separate your combo pills and just go up on one both of them are just once a day pills so it’ll just be multiple pills that you’ll be taking them once okay i'll be right back um did you get your flu shot and you just had it okay and uh let me see @@@ up-to-date on your vaccinations shingles shot let's do one @@@ for you everything else looks good alright we decided to skip that @@@ for now and not go looking for anything but no urinary symptoms no getting up a lot at night or okay @@@ perfect and i think you need @@@ what we'll do is we'll just um we'll discontinue the combination pills and we'll order you just the lisinopril at 40 which is the better of the two for you to particularly because you are a diabetic @@@ um yes we want you on an as high of ace inhibitor as we can as it'll help @@@ kidneys so just one pill daily do you want it mailed to you you can continue taking what you have now since you don’t have a problem with it just once you get the new medication just switch over @@@ you get a 90 day supply and then what else oh i am going to get some blood work you know where the lab is you can just stop in there before you leave and get it done you don’t need an appointment so and then you can continue @@@ medications come and see me again in three months okay and then you know as i think i will would you prefer i order the bloodwork so you can get it before your appointment like maybe early in the morning so i will order blood work prior to that appointment okay i’ll just go through your list @@@ okay alright so it's good to see you again and uh you too just have fun you can just check-out uh-huh bye dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/job# 1233984 transaction # 578-10-2-316-0103 </doctor> <patient> hi! i am okay other then this back pain three nights ago i fell on my steps bringing in the groceries from the car i fell and landed on my right hip i hit my low back on the railing okay date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ yes good morning how are you terrific thank you yes yeah they sent me a a letter and uh everything's fine nope okay no yes yes uh-huh a right there i'm thinking uh as of january 1 over no you gave me the gum uh-huh one one day i used it yeah i don't know why okay well i haven't been biking so but i just bought a new newer bike uh-huh now what is that okay uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh the pharm-d oh i just got my medication in last week so probably not for another three months no uh uh okay right i understand uh probably because of inactivity i've just been walking the dog the short walks and uh i gotta start it again and with the holidays coming i've been cheating a little bit more than a little bit uh-huh terrific no uh-huh still do eh why not it's a target date we'll see uh-huh umm @@@ right uh-huh no i don't uh-huh right okay because of the weather i'm a biker bicycle bike and i walk the dog 3-5 miles a day and now we're down to about one oh i know what they do i just i just fell off is all yeah i'll be back on it january 1 uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay right okay okay alrighty yes just had it uh about ten minutes ago uh-huh that i haven't had ha ha right right uh uh okay okay okay sure uh-huh alright uh-huh okay not a problem yeah uh-huh uh-huh okay terrific @@@ thank you very much okay have a great time </patient>,True,1,True,1,True,True

bit about your partners or or partner and i and i was wondering if you use condoms ok have you had a sexually transmitted infection before ok any concerns currently any vaginal discharge or itchiness or or pain ok and have you been pregnant before ok and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before ok do you take any medications regularly any allergies to medications alright uhm and any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past ok and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently like who you live with and and where ok so have you been around anybody who's been sick has he been sick at all like any any cough sore throat anything like that ok uh and have you traveled anywhere and do you smoke cigarettes how about do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products ok so it sounds like socially do you use any other recreational drugs ok and do you drink alcohol ok and this is like one glass or two ok and in the family has there been anybody who's had any cancers ok how about any genetic diseases or anything congenital that runs in the family ok so that was everything that i wanted to ask about on history and so next we'll go ahead and get vitals and do a physical exam but did you have anything else that maybe i forgot to ask about or any other symptoms maybe uhm so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever however it could be caused by other things as well uhm currently your constellation of symptoms with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck sore throat it sounds like you may have uhm an inflamed spleen as well which could all be signs and symptoms of something called ebv or or mono and it sounds like you might have had an exposure like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat all that being said today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work and we will do a covid swab as well just in case thank you it is nice to see you again miss we are following up on a few things today how is your arm feeling how has your mood been are you feeling any relief from your symptoms since you have been on the lexapro how much lexapro are you taking now how long have you been taking the full dosage i want you to take the full dosage every day this might be why you have not had much relief with your symptoms yet your hands are a little shaky is this a normal occurrence for you it is very subtle we will keep an eye on it for now your blood pressure is a little better today have you experienced any worsening joint or bone pain i want to check on your osteoporosis and osteoarthritis date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ sorry about the wait follow me that's okay okay how are you doing today alright i saw that you were recently hospitalized yeah so how have you been doing since then okay okay how's it going going well and when was your last drink when was that tell me how that happened okay okay okay yeah okay and you stopped the drinking i mean how do you feel about the program are you committed since then okay i'm not sure @@@ okay i know that's tempting alright you did it okay otherwise any shakes any tremors any hallucinations yeah you did headaches visions changes good are you sweating a lot good so you're done with all that okay huh well i looked over your labs uh from last month everything looked pretty good the only thing we haven't had from you in a while is a cholesterol panel you haven't had it for about a year so i need you to go and get that to make sure everything is good i mean um this is a fasting blood test did you have lunch today well we can get it some other time at your convenience you haven't uh but we need to get it at least one a year @@@ otherwise your chemistry panel your kidneys your blood counts your liver so far look good and those @@@ (someone knocks on the door) doctor talks to person uh-huh yeah that can happen if you're in the hospital a lot you get it uh-huh but it's a colonization @@@ active infection going on okay sounds good okay okay when do you get it every day is it always on that one side and it's only on the right side i'm not quite sure any numbness or tingling no when you get it how long does it last for any rash okay do you still smoke you do okay how much do you smoke okay @@@ so last time you were here a year ago you we got the other hepatitis tests done and they were negative you had an ekg test that was negative but i just wanted to make sure that you know the results of all those that was negative they were both negative that's not @@@ that was negative too hep b hep c and hiv negative which is good especially with alcohol use affecting the liver we wanted to make sure uh when was the last time you saw the eye doctor okay perfect okay so we're on our way there @@@ have you had any trouble swallowing good good good great yeah and you need those vitamins potassium and that's because of the dehydration uh so you were at primary borderline back on november 16th so that's okay any usually you know that level's okay no problem so let me @@@ did you have your flu shot this year @@@ no you're fine you're fine okay yeah any burning when you urinate take some deep breaths alright any pain when i press down here okay you can sit up good deep breath any swelling in your legs good everything sounds good and no belly pain nausea vomiting constipation okay @@@ right oh that too yeah you can’t tolerate it good oh i bet yeah i bet probably had some malnutrition do you need any refills on any of the migraine medicine or anything because the doses you have are do you want the patch or do you want the gum we’ll give you one piece of the highest dose we have that's yeah yeah but each time you take one piece yeah yeah okay perfect you want to pick it up here yeah let me talk with my attending and i'll be right back it seems like you're doing better i'm glad that you're in this program um right uh-huh right uh-huh so yeah we'll talk with them and see what they say i'm glad you have an appointment and everything i'll be back in just a moment alright alright sir so we're not going to change anything your blood pressure looks pretty good now uh so we're not gonna start anything or make any changes right now um otherwise the soonest you need to come back probably a couple months after the program's done here to check up on you to make sure yes they'll give you a call uh-huh okay if you're able to get back to sleep the sleeping pills aren't really the ones that we would use for that situation are you having like nightmares bring it up to the psychiatry people up there too since to see if there's anything special but if you're able to go back to sleep and you're able to actually fall asleep i don't recommend any further sedating medicine they also have an addictive potential that's why i don't want to give you medication for that right now but i think once you stop drinking then we'll see how the insomnia goes alright sir @@@ @@@ that's a postnasal drip situation @@@ laying down a lot and when you wake up @@@ i can give you a nasal spray @@@ a nasal spray to help clear it up i don't you can try it temporarily just to see if it helps clear it up yeah i can put that in for you it should all be there i think like when you get a number and you wait it'll probably be ready and @@@ yeah yeah you should get a number you're good to go yep it's in there take care good luck @@@ it @@@ so just hopefully you'll just see me @@@ but it all just depends what day it is and whoever is available @@@ but we all take turns yeah i'll put it in the computer thank you oh @@@ to the left </doctor> <patient> umm yeah so i just came in today with i've been having a few symptoms for the last i would say 5 days so i've had it started with a sore throat just five days ago kind of just very irritating sore throat sensation that's kind of gotten worse over the last few days and then i started getting a fever four days ago and it has been going on for the last couple of days as well and the highest temperature i measured on myself was 38.8 degrees celsius and yeah so that that's that's my main concern right now i would say it's getting worse i have some pain with swallowing food as well as like now even when i'm talking a little i'm getting some pain as well i do feel like i've lost a bit of my appetite over the last three to four days uhm i don't think so not yet i but i think like the way it's hurting right now i feel like it's coming yeah now that you mention it i i do have like these two lumps on the right side of my neck like kind of right below the jaw uhm not not really like when i'm pressing on them they don't really hurt but i definitely have two lumps yeah i've i haven't really had much of an appetite kind of just i've skipped work just trying to take it easy like just napping the whole day as much as i can no headaches no uh no no runny nose or so i i don't have headaches but i i i think i was having some body aches just yesterday uhm not really it's kind of just like a general like i don't know if it was it was because i was lying around the whole day but just kind of a general pain throughout the body no not really no no wheezing no no no chest pain no uh no not really uhm actually yeah yesterday when i was uhm like when i was having the body pain i also noticed a little bit of abdominal pain just like on the upper i would say upper left side just since yesterday it's it's not really like i would say it's more of a discomfort than a pain but i definitely do feel like like something's just not right in that area yeah like i i try not to lie on that side i have to go on to the other side yeah that that just started yesterday no no uhm no chills well yeah i would say a couple nights ago i might have had some chills but mainly it's just been i've been feeling more hot and i have been kind of getting like night sweats no just just this week no it's been pretty steady it kind of comes and goes i've probably taken temperatures like every day but i would say it's definitely for the last few days it's been more of a fever like the nightsweats sensation before it was a bit fine like but the highest temperatures have been in the last few days uhm just like i i don't know like i don't think there are any changes but i did notice some like kind of just pink pink spots on my arm the other day no they weren't really itchy just like a couple i would say like raised not raised spots just like flat kind of pinkish spots no hasn't really started spreading yet i just noticed it on on my arm and i i don't think it has really spread at all yeah no join pains no yes yeah so i i just have one partner right now my fiance and we uh i actually like have in an iud so like we we don't use condoms but like we're pretty honest and safe with each other i fully trust him like he doesn't have any partners or anything like that and i only have i don't have any other partners as well no never no nothing like that no i haven't no uhm just uh i have had just eczema in the past but that that's fairly stable it's been treated i don't really have it anymore currently no no no no yeah so i'm just living with my fiance and that's we're living in like a small apartment and right now we're not really seeing anyone else really during the pandemic i just had to go into work like one day last week just to grab some of my stuff but didn't really come into contact with anyone my fiance does go to his work like a couple like three or four times during the week so i don't know if he got into contact with anyone it's it's hard to say he did have a sore throat last week but it kind of just went away on its own in a couple of days and compared to me like his was nothing really no no uh probably smoke marijuana just maybe once or twice a month yeah no nothing else yeah i probably have some red wine every other day i would say yeah no it's just like a normal glass of wine maybe like we probably go through like a bottle between both of us like every two weeks maybe no no no cancer is in the family not that i know of no i don't think so do you think it can be covid at all ok that sounds good thank you my arm is all better it is not in pain at all anymore it's helping a little bit i am taking ten m g about a week ago i don't take it every day i don't feel like i need it some days okay i didn't even notice no yes ma'am okay missed several appointments here for various reasons okay i'm pretty good today several times well i'm in the i'm in the let's see what they call it apt upstairs uh 35 day inpatient program just fine fine yeah oh um well i had a very tiny bit on a field trip during the program uh let's see that was around the 10th i believe uh it was a crazy field trip it was what they call um uh what do they call that thing; it was a national guard thing um stand down and a lot of homeless veterans show up in that and it's kind of a party atmosphere and in line i drank a bit and uh they were going to throw me out of the program they put me in the nut ward on 7 for seven days and let me back in the program yeah i'm trying to i mean i don't think the i think the program's flawed because they had four field trips just in the first 21 days i was there in the first 21 days four field trips – for an inpatient to me that didn't seem like a normal inpatient program okay but from what i understand most programs at least 21 days before you can see the outside world but anyway um i am committed but i was standing in line for five hours with a bunch of homeless drunks and so on with bottles in their pockets and that's pretty tempting you know i'm not justifying it but i did it and i spent seven days on the nut ward for it oh no no i had no dts or anything no no no i did my uh i did my detox before i went into the program no no yeah i'm done with all that a little bit of insomnia still but it seems to be getting better i'm gonna take my jacket off it took so long to actually see the doctor cause i missed so many appointments okay is that all you do today i've never had high cholesterol i doubt that's an issue okay well i okay during my last withdrawls um you know they do the nostril check with a giant swabs um they said that i had mrsa but i had cystic issues for years and nothing severe severe just acne okay well i'm seeing dermatology on the 5th um and um uh and i told you i've got a little bit of insomnia um i had um it seems to be getting better but occasionally for a while i was getting like a sharp stinging thing in the knee but um in my right knee and it shoots just like in a straight line like this and i don't know what is generally be but it's not well i used to get when climbing in and out of bed i don't know if it yeah but uh it's not very often anymore but it's the same feeling i don't know what that would be but right here it's a shooting pain that way it's only on the right side on the outside in the front by the knee right here i mean no it's just it's a burning no no no no no no it's inside it's just something right in through here oh yeah but if you want to um prescribe me some um i'm suppose to ask you to prescribe me nicorette but not the weak 2 mg stuff cause that doesn't do anything i smoke a pack a day but i do smoke a cigar occasionally i mean so that's @@@ stronger than the typical @@@ uh-huh that was all negative okay now the hepatitis they just tested for hepatitis c too right good okay uh-huh absolutely um i'm supposed to see the eye doctor on january the 12th and they're making me new eyeglasses right now i'm having those soon that went away and i don't know what was causing that but i couldn't even get pills down they used to gag me and now i take a whole fistful of them every morning cause they got me on a million vitamins yeah i understand they just said that i was oh what's the stuff that's in bananas uh they said i was high on potassium okay so that's okay now or okay okay yeah somebody gave me one finally someone gave me one @@@ is it something i got to lay back on or i did get some uh something for my back i think it's muscular @@@ @@@ no no no no i mean i get a little bit of that pain like when i had the pancreatitis but very minor and only if i eat very heavy i think it's just like serious quantity is an issue i've got an aunt you know i an enormous amount of weight last year okay i got down to 129 pounds so now i'm back to close to my original weight so i've been eating heavy to cause i was weak and i was skinny so i've been putting the weight back on but i can't go overboard if i do it it does cause me some problems i think i'm in good shape the nurses said to get the nicorette and i need um and i should get a stronger dose that's what the doctor up on 9 said cause it they gave me 2 and that's nothing like chewing air gum 1 piece you mean one box okay yeah and that’s all i take of the others i pick it up right here right yeah i'll pick it up and take it up to 9 uh-huh i think i'm doing better i'm getting really sick of this cystic acne it was getting a lot better because i was on the intravenous ivs for the pancreatitis i was getting um oh what do you call it antibiotics i cleared up pretty good and now the cystic acne back and i don't know if it’s from the detoxing or what but it's hard it's painful they are deep under the skin it's not surface that's what i'll talk with them i'm serious uh-huh good how will i know will they give me a call or something okay is there because i'm waking up in the middle of the night several times um i am able to get back to sleep but um is there any kind of a sleeping pill that would oh okay alright i @@@ i don't know i don't know well i oh i know that alright i've had insomnia my entire life that's a lot of the reason why i drank so much alright uh i think that's it alright no no oh i have kind of heavy white nasal discharge every morning it comes out but it's ridiculously thick and it's white what's that is it something i should use okay okay and i should be able to pick up the uh nicorette nasal sprays how long do you think i should give the pharmacy oh i should get a number first and okay alright cause otherwise the nurses are gonna cut me off on the nicorette because even though i still have some in my box up there they're gonna say i don't have a prescription so i can't have any more alright cool okay okay and everything that we did here they know about on 9 everybody @@@ okay thank you yeah thank you which way i go this way left okay time is 3:55 dd: @@/@@/@@ dt:

good you're welcome good afternoon sir my nurse tells me you're twenty eight years old is that correct so what happened which hand is it is this your dominant hand where does it hurt what kind of treatments have you had how is your pain today how would you describe your pain today good do you have any numbness or tingling today date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@ so i see you saw the eye doctors today uh so far yeah what do you think is @@@ okay perfect @@@ i'm sorry you’re still having the diarrhea you can have a seat how often are you having it what’s “quite often?” how many episodes a day @@@ times is it watery okay yeah it was all normal well it's the same thing colon is the intestines they look at your entire intestines with a colonoscopy are you losing any weight or gaining weight okay any nausea or vomiting uh-huh i know it's hard absolutely do you feel anxious at all do you feel like you're stressed out or anything like that or no okay your blood pressure looks good today you're taking your two medicines correct perfect and at home it's been looking okay that's okay it looks good today that's fine and are you taking the psyllium powder try to take it as often as you can daily or something like that i don't know if it'll help but try that yeah you have a… oh yeah when did you first notice that okay and has it gotten bigger it's okay um do you want to go see surgery again do you want to get it drained or just going down what do you want to do okay what did they do for it or does it just go down did you do anything okay any burning when you urinate any penile discharge yeah and does it ever have any pus come out of it or anything like that well some people just have a certain bacteria and they are prone to get what's called furuncle they're little abscesses and they tend to be in areas that are more moist so the groin area @@@ sometimes in the armpits and they tend to do that so you know keeping it clean and that'll go a long way and help out and know some people are prone to get it because they have what's called @@@ a certain bacteria in their body; from one source or another who knows and then for some reason some people are more prone to develop these little abscesses they just have to keep getting drained it's annoying when was the last time that you saw the surgeons it's been a while well when was the last time you got it drained february okay do you smoke okay very good i'm gonna take a listen to you @@@ did you get your flu shot this year okay perfect do you need any refills on your blood pressure medicine okay want to get it mailed to you take some deep breaths one more good breathe normally no belly pain or anything like that does it feel full like fluid or okay do you feel fuller is it painful okay uh-huh any swelling in your legs just a little @@@ let me go check a couple of things and i'll be back okay yeah i @@@ take a look at it go ahead @@@@ has it gotten bigger do you think right there okay you don't have any other ones that you're aware of up in the groin yeah right in here right you don't have anything there there’s no lesion on your penis you never had a lesion or anything like that let me see have you always had that is that that's not new yeah if it’s going back down @@@ surgery to go look at it or um just wait for it to go down whatever you want uh that area is a little bit harder to drain if it's that small you know what i mean it's a little bit harder if it's that small but um it's something i can refer you @@@ no problem or we can wait and see if it goes down @@@ about it what do you want to do yeah so @@@ it seems pretty superficial they just have to be careful when they drain it and if it's going down maybe not mess with it right now it's a pretty invasive procedure and that's a pretty @@@ area i'll be right back alright sir so in terms of constant diarrhea i'm not quite sure what else you can do from the general medicine clinic other than reinforce the fiber things that we’ve told you before so i know you’re going back to the gi doctors too so um @@@ back to the surgery clinic and maybe have them take a look at it and see if it does get bigger to have it at least looked at you know and they can compare it and then uh for your blood pressure let's see one of the numbers is a little bit high today and i was wondering if we should go up on one of your medicines yeah cause even the lower number has been a little bit on the higher side and so the metoprolol you take 25 mg twice a day yeah why don't go to a whole pill okay and then if it makes you dizzy then drop back to a half a pill and then come back in okay i need to put it into the system for you and you have two refills of the hydrochlorothiazide so i'll go ahead and refill it as well and then other than that i think that's everything you got your flu shot and everything so i'll have you go back up there and make an appointment with the general surgery clinic the door to where you check in and then you'll go there the next time i see you um which will probably be in three or four months or so go ahead and go to the lab before you come in and get a cholesterol panel done yeah it's a cholesterol level you just do it once a year you had it in november of last year and did you eat lunch or breakfast today well we can do then today if you want; if you don't want to we'll have you do it when you come back whichever one you would prefer okay i'll put in to do that do that today @@@ right across the hall here right across the hall go to the lab @@@ you have a nice day </doctor> <patient> yeah hi i'm so i have been very wheezy for the past week um and i'm also like consistently coughing all the time and it's not getting any better um i do have asthma and i think it's it's acting up since i was like 5 yes so i am on a short acting as well as an inhaled cortico steroid and i only take the short acting like when i have the symptoms for the past week i would say the ventilin that i use is almost every day like a couple times a day yes i missed two days i woke up twice last week yes that's right uh but it's mostly exertion but things like cold air can trigger it too uh no nothing like that it's dry i i'm getting an on and off but basically every time i cough after that i'll be wheezy for a little bit no nothing like that no no blood ventilin um it's been helping temporarily but it definitely doesn't help as much as it used to uhm no nothing like that he no nothing like that no no um a little bit because i haven't been sleeping too well no uh no no no i do um yes no just some multi vitamins that's about it not to medication i’m allergic to like strawberries and kiwis i just break out in hives no ah nope i love with both my parents and two of my siblings no everyones pretty healthy no i haven’t i don't think so oh i'm pretty i feel pretty safe no yeah so what can i do about these these symptoms should i continue taking my puffers yeah that sounds great thank you good morning doctor yes that's correct well i punched a wall about three days ago it's my right hand unfortunately yes it is um it's right here on the outside of my hand i went to the e d and they pushed some of the joints in my hand back and they put me in a splint so i've been wearing that ever since compared to when it started it's much better today today i'd say it's minimal pain no thankfully not yeah @@@ @@@ yes the reason @@@ i say that's the @@@ @@@ quite often it’s like all day long non-stop it's like something like usually one before i go to work probably once or twice get to work i have to use it twice when i get home usually and when i go to bed i have to use it the other morning like 3 or 4 i have to go to the bathroom it’s like constantly it’s like i’m never @@@ yeah it's watery and uh real hard like i'm never i never feel the relief like i can't just go once and i'm done it's like more in there i expect they had checked my colon well i think it's in my intestines they got these so i think i got @@@ that's all or a tapeworm or something something ain't right no still the same size well when i use it there is so much that come out at once it's a lot uh-huh i really haven't been checking yeah not that often but i take it no it ain't no help i had surgery on my groin yeah i have another one it's like not in the groin area it's like up under my scrotum about a month ago it was it went down now but it keeps coming and going though uh i could get it looked at see if they could drain keeping it clean no it gets really hard like a knot

describe your symptoms what's the intensity of these headaches do these headaches interfere with your ability to do your activities do you have any sinus congestion are you stressed out at work are

been good very good alright right you're doing better now oh okay okay okay yeah good right okay alright you're gonna go back and see the neurology doctors it looks like okay good okay yeah okay okay @@@ okay okay i see okay so it's uh okay when was the last time you had it okay okay okay okay um is there any burning when you urinate okay are you urinating more frequently than normal right right yeah um okay um so this belly pain it's on the starts up on the right side and then yeah it hurts down there when did that start okay okay okay okay just when you were using the restroom yeah okay okay and is it just at the time when you're urinating or is it just like when you're like sitting down or okay okay right right moles you're saying yeah i see it yeah i see and it doesn't wipe off right okay like what's going on yeah okay okay okay sounds good right let me see if you brought @@@ the last time @@@ oh yeah @@@ okay okay okay okay i got it okay oh okay okay oh no i'm just taking a look see if it's uh cause i know you back in august you saw the gi doctors other than that it looks really good okay you still taking the omeprazole the acid blocker you aren't okay @@@ good right right okay now when's the last time you've seen the women's health do you go see them about that time yeah yes exactly i can put that in right correct oh okay you go over there to u of i okay do you see women's health here or do you go got it got it okay alright okay uh alright @@@ files here your blood testing looks great you started yoga which is awesome okay yeah yes please right um so that's okay you know the thing is there's a pretty wide variation in blood pressure cuffs and blood pressures so honestly like we do it the only time we get excited about blood pressure being too high is when you're consistently elevated for like multiple readings over like the course of a month okay so i mean if you had an isolated reading that's high it could just be the cuff sorry a blood pressure cuff right right deep breaths in and out and again and again and again go ahead and lie back for me so belly pain comes off and on usually when you're in the washroom sitting down uh-huh yeah right alright okay can you go ahead and just pull your shirt up a little bit just so i can see your skin any relationship to food whatsoever meals okay okay got it okay @@@ down there a little painful there now okay any tenderness over here okay just a little bit in there @@@ this one here at all any problems with diarrhea blood in you - so are you just ticklish or painful over here okay okay alright no problems with bowel movements fevers chills nausea or vomiting or anything like that right right got it right right have you ever had your gallbladder out have you ever had your gallbladder removed when you had that uh the aneurysm in your aorta okay you had uh a mesh placed or a repair none of the above we just were watching it alright okay yeah @@@ are you having any back pain okay lean forward @@@ right okay right right oh yeah i'm not sure the name of it either i don't know yeah okay i'm just trying to figure out if we should get that cat scan they wanted to do that repeat cat scan uh to keep an eye on that aorta uh but i don't think that we you know now that you're having pain you might want to get that get it repeated a little sooner because we'll see uh yeah that’s normally how it presents @@@ back @@@ you're absolutely right it's kind of atypical um do you think you strained a muscle or something doing the yoga is that possible it's not like that right right @@@ right right well let me take a look see here so it looks like you have good kidney function so that's a good thing uh oh okay so you need a longer prescription on it okay right right okay yeah i can put that in for that for you you do not feel like it's a urinary tract infection correct but you had one of those before okay okay let's uh go ahead and get another urine sample from you today um yeah it sure is oh yeah oh @@@ yeah uh you're talking about the muscle problems yeah i actually don't know i'm gonna have to talk my attending about it okay okay right and then we'll go from there i'll be right back in just a minute alright now so a couple of things we just want you to give a urine sample to make sure there's nothing going on with your bladder that um also cause you're kind of having some tenderness in your belly kind of in funny places so we'd like to check some labs on you um and go from there um this is happening kind of intermittently in the last several weeks is that right okay okay so if this worsens at all don't hesitate to come back here if they can’t get you in here you can come to the er um and if the labs are normal we might just have to pursue some imaging okay but uh like a cat scan or something i don't think we need to go that far i think just like i think the urine is kind of where the money is um especially cause you had the you know some infection this summer so um i think we'll start there um and go from there then we'll have you follow up in the women's health clinic as well just to kind of set you up with your routine screenings okay let me take a look see that's right now did you say is it painful it doesn't hurt got it okay have you ever had this problem before @@@ some cream on there okay got it you did okay yeah alright do you want some terbinafine cream is that is the cream working it's working okay good okay cause it could be the beginnings of they call it the morgan freeman spots it could be that um if you have i think there's a fancy name for it but everybody knows it as the morgan freeman @@@ no i absolutely nothing like @@@ not cancer right if they get worse or like if there's new ones that are popping up or if they become painful just let us know okay and we'll get you back in and we can send you to dermatology okay very good alright this is what we're gonna do yeah so look okay i'll put in all the refills for everything and yeah we'll extend it out so that you can get like exactly uh what i could do too is i'll put in all the lab work for you to make sure you're not having any problems so just stop by the lab oh just some blood and then urine that's the only thing and then you're done uh blood is for your belly we want to make sure there's nothing going on so here's the deal you had let me take a look here i wrote it down yeah we can do you in every year so you're not due for another like six months yeah i'm happy with how things look with your cholesterol i want you to just hand that to the clerk right here and they'll schedule you for women's health okay very good thank you ma'am </doctor> <patient> i've been having headaches for a while now um i had my first one about two months ago um i'd say it was more gradual right here between my eyes i'd say it feels like a pressure sensation um they're about moderately severe i guess yes they do my regular activities are significantly more difficult now yeah i do i also have some light sensitivity yes i have a very stressful job doctor well no not at all i even try to have a little drink before bed and it doesn't help no nothing like that hi how are you we got lost thank you well i feel much better than i've felt in a long time @@@ i felt bad all summer you know you know so yeah i'm feeling better i mean i still you know get lightheaded after i walk for about a mile and a half i mean i don't know if it's lightheaded or wobbly or whatever but and uh i still have that left eye feels like something is pushing out of it but you know i don't know that is swelling or getting dry or something i've had all that checked and they can't find anything at all you know he looked in my ears a couple of weeks ago and there was an irritation in there but they didn't they didn't i mean when they touched it it was uh there was a little spot that was real sore but they didn't make anything of it or anything i cancelled that because it's like i mean they just i mean it's just the same thing over and over so i'm just so i cancelled that and i cancelled my i had a rheumatology because my arms and everything was shaking but uh since i've started doing yoga it feels better and there are certain things i have been doing to exercise with my arms so i just think that maybe that was part of it and uh my the quick burst of headaches that i was having they are gone away for the most part every now and then i might have a quick burst but it's gone you know the only thing that's really bothering me now is for some reason i get pain down in my lower abdomen i'd say my bladder but i don't know what it is like to my right side and then down to my abdomen so sometimes and that doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's just kind of quick and intense and one time it did stop me from moving for a while after i used the washroom i couldn't move so but that's you know that's it uh actually it feels sore now it happens a few times a week i don't know but the first time that it happened was about a month ago i think and i'd used the washroom i was out and i used the washroom and i went to i walked out of the washroom and a pain hit me and i could not move i had to stand there for a while so and then it you know it just uh comes and it goes it's nothing i've noticed no blood there's no discoloration of my urine it's a light yellow and you know so i don't know if maybe i'm holding my urine too long or no there's no burning @@@ no i mean if i drink more water i will but you know but no it's right here it's almost like it's right it's right here on my left side and i've had problems with this on and off this side here and then look and this is where it really hurts down underneath my bladder like um the first episode i had was about see i don't know if i had been having slight pains before when i had that bladder infection or whatever infection i had but i don't recall it so it must not have been that significant but when i about a month ago when i used the washroom and then i went out and i went to walk and it's after i washed my hands i stepped out the washroom and wow that pain hit me so i said wow it was sharp and intense so and yeah but that time but it comes like if i'm sitting down or something and i get up i might feel it or something so cause actually i feel it right now in my left side but it's it's not like intense it's just you know well sometimes i'm it seems to like it's more like when i'm sitting down and i get up or something um you know but you know it's you know but it's it doesn't come that you know it comes but it's not like regular or all the time or constant i should say but uh and the only other thing i wanted to mention is i got these little white moles coming in my face now in the last couple of months yeah there's one it's real hard too and then i was looking i thought this was a crumb or something and i kept wiping it right and then i tried to you know burst it but it won't it's really hard and i say what the heck is that now yeah and those just appeared this one just appeared the one by my mouth just appeared about a month ago and the other one was maybe two or three months ago so i know you get old all kinds of things start popping out so yeah that's that's getting better that's getting better i had uh yeah but thank god that part is over and it seems like my face is getting better on this side so it may have had something to do with my root canal every now and then i get a little numbness uh and i do have another tooth over there that they got to work on but but i'm trying to put that off as long as i can you know i broke my bridge so that's number one now i gotta get that fixed i'm getting an implant and uh it's probably before i had a bridge here and the front tooth is gone so i'm gonna get an implant there let me stop talking so you can look up whatever yeah no i don't take any of that anymore i stopped taking that man a long time ago i quit you know i don't want to get caught up in it you know i just try to not eat late and not go to bed on a full stomach and stuff that i can do to kind of help it you know and so for the most part that's okay every now and then i might eat something that makes me a little bit nauseated but other than that you know but i haven't been up there ever since last year but it is coming up time for me to order uh for them to order a mammogram probably takes a long time to get that appointment maybe like two months or something i mean to get the mammogram set-up; it takes a long time cause i go to the university of illinois they don't do them here yeah yes but i have to see women's health here and then they refer me to the u of i cause they just started doing the mammograms uh-huh yeah i do that pretty often you know doctor uh my blood pressure i know that its people always tell me the blood pressure's great but it's kind of sporadic to me and i don't know what that's about like i when i went to get my implant they examine for that do you want me to take this off okay when i went to get that examined uh he my blood pressure was like 106/88 which is a weird number 88 that 88 being so high like that yeah maybe something was wrong with their cuff cause that's weird oh okay you said cuff oh i'm sorry don’t i'm think i'm not happy i'm not taking blood pressure medicine cause cholesterol is bad enough well not necessarily in the washroom sitting down but when i'm sitting like if i'm in the living room sitting and i get up i can feel it down here and it's on the right side it's not the left side somewhat but it's on the right and right here just a little bit but i said man there must be a line or something going from here to here causing that cause now it's more to the right i didn't say i didn't mean the left; it's more to the right than it is to the left no i haven't noticed any of that that's a little tender no it's a little no no no painful when you press on it right here sometimes i feel like a pressure like at my naval under my naval no no i'm just hot and cold all the time that's that's hormones things and i'm doing my exercises and even if i get tired i keep going and i'm trying to mix it up you know i'm trying real hard to lose weight but @@@ but i'm trying to eat @@@ i'm you know making fruit smoothies and stuff @@@ um no no i still do no it's not @@@ right the last time they it was three months ago in april i think they said they want to do another one in six months after that but i @@@ pardon uh just lower back but i attribute that to uh right along in here i attribute that to my yoga poses cause what i do is i do uh twists no i do twists; you know i do twists where i'm twisting by contorting my body and they said it was okay to keep doing all that stuff i mean i'm twisting my upper torso one way and the lower part of my body the other way trying to exercise my spine and so then after i do that and then some of the uh the standing yoga poses where you forget the name of the one it's a common one where you stand with your legs opened and your knees slightly bent and you @@@ backwards slightly backward stance i forget the name of it god i can't believe i forget the name of it um you know it hurts a little bit and i have to uh do something to loosen it up no i just assumed that if i had a problem with the aorta that my back would be i would have sharp intense pains in the upper part of my back no i can tell when i strain a muscle no it's not it's not a muscle strain and i wondered i said man am i passing uh the calcium that comes in there cause i was taking so much calcium but i decided to ease up off of that calcium and actually i've been lax with taking my vitamins but i eased off the calcium cause i said man i'm taking all this stuff and uh there was a study that was on the news where they say calcium really doesn't do that much good and i'm saying you know the calcium pills i'm saying oh my goodness for 40 years i been taking calcium and it's not doing any good uh-huh probably another thing something i want to make sure that my uh i'm having problems getting my cholesterol medication because the last time it was just the prescription was renewed for just 30 days yeah cause at the women's clinic they initially renewed it every 90 days but then i would go in and get my blood checked every six months so they just would give me a 90 day supply and it was uh where you can get three or four refills yeah they said i had one this summer they said that was probably one of the reasons i was feeling bad cause i felt bad all summer do you know if lipitor is better than the statin is lipitor a statin somebody told me that uh the lipitor doesn't cause the muscle problems or something that the side effects is not as bad with lipitor as with uh zocor have you had that or anything yeah uh the side effects yeah cause i been taking that a long time i can't seem to get my cholesterol down and i eat healthy but i do go overboard with all the exercise i do i mean i do two or three hours of exercises a day for about three or four days a week sometimes five sometimes six i say man i try to mix it up i go walking i ride my bike stationary i do yoga i do cardio swim now i do another exercise tape i do all kinds of stretches okay okay okay thank you okay right but the first time was about a month ago okay yeah uh-huh uh-huh okay and what do you think about switching things @@@ it's hard it's right here no no it's just hard that came about four months ago and this one bout a month ago here no and i got a ring worm too i put some uh yeah i put some hydrochloride or something i got it from a hotel i'm sure yeah i got some yeah it's working yeah i did make up some soda and vaseline but then i went and bought some uh-huh okay oh okay well it you don't think that is anything to worry about yeah it's just; yeah it just looked like a bread crumb and i @@@ you know when someone tells me to wipe my mouth okay yeah okay great alright thank you so what am i gonna so don't forget the cholesterol stuff yeah all i have to do is call it in and get it on the phone oh you know what i might be able to do that now i mean what do you want me to do now okay okay what's your blood for okay so you don't think while you're at it that my cholesterol should be

chest pain you did did they admit you did they send send you up to the hospital in march okay you said you @@@ palpitations hmm do you feel like your heart is racing yeah possibly it could be um tell me how long does it last not long just seconds no pain associated with it no pain going down the arm or like the jaw anything like that no okay @@@ sweating shortness of breath yeah did they send home did they send you home did they send you home with a device or not right oh a pulse ox yeah yeah did they and they said no more caffeine and decrease stress did that help no not really do you think you have heartburn every day three bottles goodness oh it's not oh not for you oh goodness alright go on that's the spaghetti sauce would do it tomatoes uh-huh uh-huh did you get ketchup with the corn beef yeah exactly when did you start having heartburn yeah and every day or just intermittently or with certain foods zantac or tums you been taking tums yeah why you've been taking ranitidine twice a day it's the same thing as omeprazole it will long term chronic will do it but if you're having heartburn now okay so in a way that is something good right risks of getting daily heartburn right you're eroding the lining right your esophagus you can get barrett's that leads to cancer you need to a) be on the right diet doing all the right stuff we call it lifestyle modification and you need to be on medicine with time it might get better if you don't have to be @@@ what he's talking about is over the years over the years of being on omeprazole yeah no let's try let's try both let's try you know cutting down on the spaghetti cutting down on the mints the citrus stuff does it have tomato in it it has tomato yeah yes does it give you heartburn right after you drink it well you're probably good then when do get @@@ okay uh you need to cut it down to one cup yeah see if it does anything but i can definitely put you back on the omeprazole did it work yeah so we'll do it it's the same thing it's just; it works on different pathways to slow down the acid production in your stomach so both of it the ppi the omeprazole works better ranitidine if it works at all it works a little bit faster but omeprazole over the long term it works better what other medicines do you need do you need the nasal spray good so just two sprays right do you use that just one the flunisolide or the sodium chloride okay okay you got those okay and then what do you take the sildenafil for oh erectile dysfunction um erectile dysfunction you take okay okay any other medicines that you're taking do you know over-the-counter or anything else nothing else so just the heartburn huh okay how's your psoriasis good yeah follow-up that's fine you can keep this one and we'll just count this as a routine check-up you don’t have to see me for another six months okay if you had another episode i wonder if i should send you home with a holter set you up with a holter monitor it's uh; it's also like a device where you go home with it you pick it up downstairs go home with it they monitor your electrical activity for 24 hours the next day you come back and you return it they record all of your things and um if there's any abnormalities i would let you know you said the first thing you said this happened once and then it happened again two days ago did it happen right after you drank caffeine and you were sleeping and @@@ it just woke you up or this one woke you up alright yeah did you are you on any medicines for anxiety sertraline yeah yeah previously oh okay were you anxious when this happened yeah could have been do you remember anything alright so yeah like i said i mean you stop if it's well controlled but obviously you're not controlled if you're having it every day right yeah any belly pain i don't know um @@@blood pressures good okay lightheadedness dizziness okay you did good umm alright any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands or anything okay yeah last time your potassium was fine um right do you have varicose veins yeah yeah there you go especially at this place i'll bet yeah oh do you think they got bigger the varicose veins sometimes with enlargement or worsening varicose veins can do that good stay hydrated stay hydrated good are your immunizations up-to-date flu shot last year pneumonia vaccine tetanus good i did something right yeah okay yeah sometimes um that is pretty early @@@ oh okay look straight any coughing fevers chills night sweats weight loss say ah how's your sinus pressure now today it's better pain pain here okay okay that's okay yeah but not any today you can take tylenol yeah uh sometimes sinus would be better it has a different agent in there in addition to the tylenol especially with that any headaches other than here okay chest pain shortness of breath your heart sounds fine deep breaths in and out deep breath deep breath again good one more great you're not hyperventilating are you pain why do you have this divot here oh no here it's going away any pain go ahead and lay back good no urinary symptoms or like uh-huh like frequency going a lot at night uh-huh uh-huh okay any accidents incontinence oh yeah do you have an enlarged prostate or no okay but you've never been to the urologist nobody's ever told you yeah did they say anything go ahead move your okay any like any change in your urinary symptoms like worsening going more often blood in your urine urge right okay uh depends if you have an enlarged prostate that can happen and with older again as you get older um that can happen your prostate starts growing more because of age um let me check your psa yeah i mean i don't think it's ever been high @@@ oh okay so it's related to the amount of water that you take yeah your psa last year six months ago was fine okay alright makes sense cause there's a diuretic effect in caffeine makes you want to go a lot more oh you're fine um what else okay so immunizations you got it yeah 65 is there your colonoscopy is just fine stress test is good were you ever a smoker yeah okay at 65 we check an ultrasound just to make sure that your blood vessels are okay so next time we'll check that out um are you taking anything over-the-counter anything like herbal medicines things like that oh yeah the next time you get labs in six months you'll see me um before that you know same thing same drill today you get labs before you see me that way i can go over your results with you um and um then i can get yeah hiv test this is something new that you take @@@ yeah right okay well i see yeah yeah yeah yeah i ask everybody i mean i’ve had people say no it's not i mean i've had the same partner for you know three years why would i need one so you say no insurance you think yeah probably probably yeah right why would you okay yeah yeah so um well i'll give you the omeprazole do you want to pick it up or do you want me to send it to you longer wait cool alright and your labs before you see me your lipids um with the exception of your hdl it was fine the hdl is your protective cholesterol as we call it it's your good cholesterol that helps you protect against heart attacks and strokes and it's 26 sometimes that can be hereditary from your family it runs low um but sometimes you know um you know it’s not it doesn't affect it it’s not affected by what you eat per se a lot of its genetics sometimes it can be brought up by exercising more the treadmill you're walking around it can boost it up okay um and if it's persistently low we can talk about putting you on something called niacin but i think exercise is better it can help it is 26 i think in the past it's been that low too 40 female it should be 50 males it should be 40 yours is at 26 you know we can consider that last time it was 32 142 which is wonderful it needs to be less than 200 and triglycerides you're just about where it should be 150 and ldl which is your bad cholesterol that i want it less than 100 and yours was 86 so the only thing is that good cholesterol to boost it up if with exercise okay give me some time okay i'll be right back alright um do you want try the test just to make sure there's nothing okay no so they'll send you something um you may have to pick it up when they notify you and then you pick it up okay so let me um holter monitor let's see a day cause they hook you up and you go home with it um for a day the next day you come back yeah i think so they put it in it's small but yeah yeah just for one day and um if they can set you up i put in the order so i'll let my nurse know uh if this can be hooked up today it would be great then you wouldn't have to make a trip back so you wear it for a day you come back and you return it to the same place you got it and then the cardiologist will then look at it and at the end if everything's okay we've got this this this or it was normal so that we can rule out bad stuff like arrhythmia i mean we can i can very easily attribute that to anxiety but then what if it's not so let's rule out the bad stuff and if it's ruled out then i can say hey it's probably anxiety okay six months you'll see me you'll be getting that omeprazole in the mail okay this for some reason two weeks or four weeks later if you don't feel any improvement okay okay it worked before great then didn't work alright and remember labs before you see me okay and i'll see you in six months yeah yeah okay let me walk out with you do you have time okay holter monitor i put him on it; do you have to call or anything were you gonna call someone

from leukemia and my mom fell victim to heart problems and alcoholism at thirty eight one of my uncles on my dad's side was recently diagnosed with leukemia hi how are you good no that's just my list @@@ but i fit the blood type yeah yeah okay uh yeah i've had uh just another sort of sinus headaches the last two weeks but that ain't why i'm here today i'm here because i was here in march something with my uh anyway since winter i've had a sinus issue but i had to go to the ent clinic yeah but in march i had this feeling in here not a pain it was like um i think you better take me to the emergency room kind i did no i saw them there no they kept me and i think they hooked me up to whatever they do when they think it’s your heart i believe it was march april it should be yeah and i didn't know why and since then i had it once about three days ago i woke up in the morning but i think it's something to do with my sinuses i swear when they're draining i woke up right out of a dead sleep with a quick went away and i'm fine the anxiety not long uh-uh sure and they hooked me up to whatever they hook you up to and they said everything looked fine i went home i went home no but i was here whatever they hooked here they put something on your finger and watched it probably i was here they waited two three hours and said everything's fine i guess they could tell i don't i had a cup of coffee today here's what i'll tell you what i really need from you today is something for heartburn cause it's driving me crazy okay here's what i ate last night for dinner cause i didn't eat nothing since 6 o'clock because of the blood tests i had three bottles of bud lite cause somebody stopped over but wait well i had friends stop over and that's not a lot not really i mean yeah i won't have another drink now until whatever i ate spaghetti with a salad it's really very mild i didn't like i'm gonna tell you i didn't have heartburn but i didn't eat nothing got up this morning all i had was water i just had breakfast here two scrambled eggs toast with jelly and corn beef hash why what is it no what's with the deal what's with the heartburn and then some night i'll i'll deliberately sit up straight i'll want to lay down but i won't cause i read an article you know if you eat and lay down right away well that could i thought it was in the last two years it's just been terrible every day sometimes so i've been taking um tums cause one of the doctors here prescribed me i was taking omeprazole but he said quit taking it cause it gave me pneumonia that's what he said so i took it it did not help ranitidine so i did try uh pepcid i don't know what's in pepcid so why won't that give me i know well they had prescribed up to three four years ago for me i took it i quit it came back i took it i quit taking it it came back i took it it quit so how long would you recommend i should stay on this i mean is it gonna be forever i'm a v8 juice guy every morning will that bother you okay i mean yeah the tomato juice but i've been drinking it for 30 years every day a glass of v8 juice nope i feel i do and my coffee i take it two cups in the morning that's it yeah and what would be the ranitidine what's the difference okay alright the doctor still has me on that the ent he's got it i got it i've been using that one oh okay so flunisolide is the spray the sodium chloride is a rinse i got it that's fine how which i haven't had that but if you could prescribe it i'll use it @@@ nope nope nope nope yeah that's just the only thing okay not a problem it's uh you know so they had me come and see you because of the fact that of the issue i had with uh this is an earlier appointment than normal okay what's that okay i was sleeping i don't know what woke me up this one woke me up it was just a quick one but you know i thought they had me down as agoraphobia but i suffer from anxiety they just switched the classification i don't know the difference they were giving me uh for years i took uh valium i'm off it now then they were giving me they have me on nothing right now i've been doing more uh i see him the end of this month uh ultraline i think they had me on yeah i had taken it and he recommended trying to do what i'm doing i've been doing more therapy when i know it’s coming i have it every sunday when i go to church i can get it i get worked up because all of those people i was sleeping i could of been dreaming i don't know that i don't know whatever so the omeprazole will be fine it's only on the long term use okay yeah it could happen you know and there's sometimes even after i make a bowel movement i get heartburn no what does that tell you it's craziness uh uh i had my eye exam and she told me that the doctor a female doctor when i say she i should say the doctor she found a wiggly spot in one of my eyes but she said you got high blood pressure i said not yet well she said usually this would be a spot on both sides so she just said remember what i said and i thought that was strange but uh uh the other day i did wake up but i never had this maybe just never right here a cramp so bad out of a dead sleep right here my wife gets them all the time but she said it's because she don't eat the i'm always eating bananas she said maybe i'm low on potassium that's what i thought that could of just been something oh yeah and i have them look at this yeah right here i never have a @@@ though they don't hurt me probably and i walk i do i think pneumonia uh you gave me the uh shingles the pneumonia i know you did the pneumonia shot i had uh four or five years ago which i thought was early they made a mistake on my age i'm just now 63 they put it but it should've been after so whenever you think it's time for another one ah uh-huh but that’s where i get the headache oh god a little today at least today i'd say i've had it just kind of and i don't know what to take for it so i end up taking a tylenol does it have to be sinus or could it just be tylenol pain relief uh uh i don't think so no what's a divot uh uh uh the urinary deal i've noticed a change but it's uh after a couple bottles of bud lite i have to go but i don't go a lot at night i do drink a little sip of water at night but like before i go to bed but the first thing in the morning when i get up i have to go to the washroom sometimes it depends it doesn't want to notify me i just go on my own now at home does that make sense is that normal i how would i know oh i've been to a urologist but i haven't been to one in five years you know as to i go more often and it seems like i really gotta you know it’s like how can i explain it the urge but there ain’t that much water is that normal i know you give me that every year and it's been the same now if i don't drink liquids i'm fine oh yeah i uh can hold the water longer than i can hold a cup of coffee though does that make sense just the urgency is there it never used to be before oh in the past yes okay for no if i get sinus whatever i take a tylenol but um or i take @@@ or i'll take a benadryl just to i don't know i think they all do the same thing okay i don't care i don't care that's it they were giving them out free; i just didn't want to stop before i think the stigma of an insurance company finding out i'll be on it is over i just never did it before because i could be honest with you; i have nothing to hide for any reason but the least you tell an insurance company the better you are i've been talking car insurance life insurance health insurance; i just think it's a lot of a lot of hooey that's probably why i never did it before i think a lot of people don't do it cause they're afraid the insurance companies if you're out there looking for help they'll say well why did you get an hiv test is that kind of a question no i mean they may say well why did you get 20 years ago they might of asked you but now i know i think it's pretty prevalent that people get them am i the only one that would ask that question no but i mean that kind of response how does everybody but i mean what they're saying is because i think the government's too nosey on everything i just i could go into stories i should think i think they know way too much now i'm not on facebook i don't think i ever will be cause if i want to talk to you i'll call you and if i want to tell you that i won the lottery i certainly ain't gonna put it on facebook people just say that's my age and i said no but i can't believe that i mean millions of people sit there and waste there idle their time away and what do i do i might watch tv jeopardy who knows you could send it to me cause if i pick it up i think it'll be a what's the hdl and what should it be oh oh okay now what's my cholesterol on the whole oh okay okay yeah i will what is it a day deal or in the mail okay and how long does the thing last or what do you do oh you come here and they hook you up on that how big oh okay so i know what i'm walking around with okay okay okay alright alrighty okay alright okay okay oh i'm sure i will feel better in two days cause it worked before that ranitidine just never i didn't know what it was doing yeah i'll do it and usually like they called yesterday and told me to come in earlier so i'll come in earlier then i know they open at 7 okay thank you uh yeah i think i need to pick it up

uh-huh okay and what did they say okay okay probably what is this oh okay yeah probably we can get one of these i'll see if i can get them you might just have to go to the financial people and they can print it out for you um okay so you mentioned a number of problems specifically back pain but i'll ask you to prioritize that's one you need to list to be addressed okay okay it's a tie uh-huh

uh-huh okay yeah that's terrible oh man okay we definitely have some things we should work on no that's okay yeah i know life gets in the way sometimes it's a good thing your wife kept on you and i’m glad you came in today um so let's see well we can definitely restart some better medicines for the migraine um you know so you can work through them and get what you need done but it's not good to be in pain all the time so we can definitely try something for the migraines um for the back pain i think that um we can you can definitely keep using pain medicines i'd like to do some probably more imaging to see what's going on there it's been a while since the last time you got an mri was in 2008 and i'd kind of like to repeat that to see what exactly is going on in there if it's worse if it's better and maybe there's something we could do as far as spinal ablation injection or surgery something like that just to see what our options are um physical therapy is good it takes awhile to get into it here due to the time but it's something that we may want to return to in the future uh-huh um the physical therapists here i think so @@@ oh could you get it over there hmm yeah maybe not you might have to get it here is that inconvenient where do you live where is that that isn't too familiar um no okay okay um okay yeah so it's a little drive okay uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah i do that @@@

you could also have your own therapist you could see you know uh-huh yeah yeah okay uh-huh i see okay you're like a lone wolf okay yeah okay well we definitely can do individual sessions um we'll we can have you see one of our psychiatrists or psychologists here we could do that um and if they suggestion group sessions you tell them what you told me and they'll work with you and they might also have some thoughts on new medications that might help um i mean usually the @@@ is more for like @@@ stuff @@@ ptsd but oh yeah did they not help or you don't like the side effects or both uh-huh

that uh-huh it's a little bit sore it's right in here yeah it's a little bit sore so is it like on the spine itself or is it more in the muscles to the side of it let me try something and see what i think tell me if it hurts more over here and here or when i press down here they have like a walk-in thing where they'll get what you need set up with them so @@@ on-call in the clinic that day but it's also something that we'll order in the system for you okay and if they have thoughts of medicines they can discuss it with you um and then finally um we might do some imaging you won't do that today; you'll just set it up whenever it’s convenient for for you um and when was the last time they ran some labs on you how @@@ @@@ come back in @@@ something we’re not addressing that you really want to okay uh-huh okay okay yeah we can definitely work on that okay so we need to get the form okay uh-huh right okay yeah we can definitely look okay um let me take this with me to show her so it could jog her memory uh yeah let's see no oh when was that okay okay i'll see @@@ notes last time she saw you okay uh-huh okay is that on the left or right left knee okay yeah yeah yeah definitely okay alright yeah uh-huh yeah um yeah we need to sort of kind of address those i mean i don't know i think @@@ surgery that's probably @@@ invasive treatment uh-huh okay well physical therapy yeah it's always good @@@ long time @@@ i'll be right back okay hey have a seat i haven't seen you in a long time @@@ too busy with your life okay so we'll do some @@@ uh you're having the same problems that you have been having for some time now okay so then the back definitely we will work it out um in terms of getting some i know you had an x-ray outside but we will @@@ so i'm going to find out about the @@@ we definitely work-up right now um so that you can establish start seeing them but @@@ okay the asthma yeah asthma and @@@ @@@ just the albuterol inhaler prn okay alright and then um pt talk about right now migraine is @@@ it's already approved no no i'll do that i'll @@@ did you sign it @@@ did you ever have imaging okay we'll put an order for @@@ @@@ and then @@@ after that @@@ okay i have to ask you a question during your service you were deployed so did you ever have a we have to ask a person about a traumatic brain injury have you ever been exposed to any of that @@@ okay and then ask about that um @@@ do i put it on the front or @@@ no they'll set you up @@@ oh right right @@@ @@@ @@@ okay gotcha @@@ it says during oif/oef @@@ okay i'll sign down at the bottom @@@ okay okay so any traumatic brain injuries yeah yeah what happened after that uh-huh uh-huh okay was also in training or in iran okay @@@ training @@@ i keep seeing deployment i think that's all there is uh okay um and hmm do you have or suspect that you have retained fragments of shrapnel anywhere in your body no okay um good okay um so yeah here's what we're gonna do i'm going to write it all out it's a lot okay @@@ @@@ gabapentin @@@ two medicines for the low back pain gabapentin is a nerve pain medicine and @@@ it's also an anti-inflammatory like aleve or ibuprofen um and then we're gonna do an x-ray of your lumbar spine and then we're going to do an mri your x-rays of the lumbar spine we can get them today if you want uh the mri we'll have to have them schedule you for that okay for migraines okay i'm going to make a copy and give it to you so what you can do is once you have done the x-rays and blood tests you can go directly upstairs @@@ 10th floor um and uh they can actually assist you and direct you for that talk to you about that um and this is a walk-in okay @@@ that you will be coming do they just @@@ up there with the shoulder guys so what service-connected status is that @@@ for compensation okay okay so i'm going to put down the current evaluation okay they reevaluate him okay so it's through the compensation and pension okay i'll get you the copy of that and you're going to go back on sumatriptan for the migraines sumatriptan and no i think it may be imitrex or it's in the imitrex family the triptan family are like uh medications that we use for migraines @@@ dilation so you don't have the pain i think the brand imitrex is sumatriptan there's a couple that are the triptan and i'll just check what imitrex is okay um we're gonna give you that medication and then a referral to see neurology um and we're gonna also get a mri of the brain @@@ good test if anything is going on we’ll find it with that okay in general we're going to check labs we're going to check your chemistry and then check labs chemistry check your blood count and we're gonna check your liver tests and then you're gonna go to the 10th floor for the ptsd @@@ uh-huh that's all the same they have a special floor that's just for the oif/oef @@@ um i also want to give you some albuterol just to have on hand so you can have your own inhaler um not that you won't still maybe have some pain and we'll have to readjust those since those are new meds or something but let's try these two they’re also for knee um i don't think so yet yeah i mean yeah i don't know orthopedic surgeons like to operate (second doctor comes in the room) you don't think he needs to see ortho for his knee do you no @@@ there are so many things that need to be done it's just like yeah @@@ and then we'll want to do we'll do an x-ray while you go get your low back x-ray um okay we're doing a lot today so we want to see you back soon so i'm going to call @@@ so you'll get a letter in the mail you'll get a letter in four weeks call for an appointment the letter will give you a number um @@@ six to eight weeks and by then we should have most of this stuff done and we can readdress we'll follow up on the pain stuff to see if it's working or not if any of your labs are a little out of whack i will call you about them if they are pretty much normal we can talk about them the next time i see you and i can tell you what they are what's your phone number uh-huh uh-huh okay uh-huh number so labs are okay if i just leave it it doesn't matter okay um okay so here's the plan it's a lot to do so i think what we should probably do first oh yeah but um oh yeah that's good @@@ you’re going to be here all day yeah that was smart um why don't you you can make this appointment um i think it's at the clerk oh i think neurology calls you; yeah you know what neurology will contact you with an appointment when i put the consult in too um i want you to go to the lab and give a blood draw you can go to x-ray which is on this floor but all the way down by the @@@ um @@@ radiology x-ray the new it’s very nice so just go in there you come out our clinic and turn right so yeah towards x-ray i guess and then go to the lab then x-ray x-ray will do the lumbar spine and then they'll schedule you for the mris okay and then you go to the lab and pick up your meds unless you want me to mail the meds to you go to the lab then you go to pharmacy to get the meds um somewhere in there the meds usually take a while so maybe i'd go do this first and then go do the meds you know what i mean especially if they want to like add anything or you want to try something they suggest then you don't have to go back twice that'd be terrible this one they should be able to direct you up here they might be able to fill it out up there um the social worker is the person that could answer that question and she's also the person that can help you with the @@@ and this form so yeah and then i'm going to document everything we talked about so the note has a lot in it so hopefully you'll get an increase in service connection @@@ never know @@@ the desk so first lab okay yeah yeah you just go up and tell them your name the lab then x-ray then 10th floor then pharmacy and do these whenever okay okay uh it was nice meeting you i'll see you in six weeks come back sooner if you need to if something goes awry @@@ but either way take care oh the @@@ oh @@@ chicago heights place i think they have a much as we do @@@ they should be able to i'll do it again and i'll see @@@ they should be able to read what i write they should see it all in there @@@ okay right yeah this is for the social worker and the psych people get those okay but this what you give to the social work people so yeah okay good to see you </doctor> <patient> so i've had this uh this cough that it started two days ago and it's been getting worse i've been bringing up this rust colored sputum yeah yeah about two days it's it's happening all day really throughout the day and really any type of exertion or or movement i'm getting short of breath and it's triggering a cough yeah even right now it feels like i'm not able to get i don't know a full breath it just feels like it's more difficult to to breathe no i haven't uh no i i i haven't had any chest pain uh i would say yeah maybe three or four teaspoons every every couple hours no it wasn't really red it's kinda orange no i haven't noticed anything like that yeah i have had i've had both of those i've had a i i checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.2 and i was pretty chilly last night ah no i mean a few weeks ago probably like a yeah a couple of weeks ago i had a runny nose and and sore throat for a couple of days it went away on its own though i did try some over the counter cold medicine it i think it might have helped me sleep last night but didn't really do a whole lot uh not really it's kind of always there no i haven't had any issues like that no i haven't uh i don't i i mean i see my granddaughter and i might have got a cold from her a few weeks ago but recently i haven't seen anybody no just a chills last night yeah i have felt like i've been been breathing a bit faster ah no not really uh no just been really tired these last couple of days and i've just felt like sleeping all day haven't felt like eating either my appetite has been really poor no i haven't i have yeah ah yeah right it doesn't feel like it's well it does feel like it's beating a bit faster than usual just not feeling too well no my weight's been about the same no i don't think so my husband and i we moved into a new kind of apartment here and it it's brand new no that's been normal no nothing like that no i haven't had any had anything like that yeah i umm i had a stroke like that like six years ago and i have type 2 diabetes as well as gerd yeah my my left hand still still it gives me some some problems i get uh uh botulinum toxin injections for for the tightness in my hand yeah i use metformin empagliflozin or an sglt2 insulin and uh and aspirin i think yeah i take a multivitamin and in vitamin d no no no no no the last time i was in the hospital was i was for rehab after my stroke no yeah well i did have a c-section for my son but that was many years ago now and everything for that was was ok yeah uhm yeah my dad had had a heart attack actually but he was in his 80s when that when that happened no i'm retired i used to be a teacher for grade 3 uhm but yeah but since retired and my husband and i just moved into a smaller apartment to make it a bit easier on us it was a lot trying to look after the house no between us two we managed to get the shopping done the cooking and and all the cleaning and that sort of thing i use a walker to get around when we're going longer distances uh yes i i spoke about half a pack per day or maybe even less since i was 15 maybe so yeah for like 45 years no i was tested actually uh a couple of years ago and that the results were normal like i've considered it but i i just don't think it it'll be possible at this time no no yeah that makes sense thank you ok thank you will do bye yes yes i have been in and out of treatment i am not doing so well with staying clean i drink and i did some coke today i have been in treatment for heroin and alcohol okay i'm alright can i use the restroom i'm alright no uh i've been dealing with things the wife’s been harping on me to come back and pick up my health care but i'm in a situation where i work for a company or a couple companies that didn't allow sick days and vacations so i @@@ take off considering i'm the only working employed person in the house so i basically now i have to let my healthcare slip to the wayside uh i been working in @@@ yeah that's what i did when i was in the army @@@ um some things stayed the same some things have been worse uh i still have migraines all the time i still uh suffer from insomnia maybe three out of seven days during the week uh my back gives me constant pain and on a constant regime of tylenol or aleve just every day just to be going and keep going uh maybe once every couple months i throw my back out and then i’m totally useless actually i've experienced the muscle spasms in my face and down through my arm it gets better and worse um i feel i don’t know how to explain it's sort of just like a shooting pain from my like the middle of my spine down into my leg it kind of immobilizes me for just one leg and it's always the same side it's always on this side uh still have difficulty breathing uh i haven’t been checked before and on occasionally i go uh i have a niece who has asthma also so occasionally @@@ medications @@@ i go over and i borrowed an inhaler from her yes uh no okay uh i've been to the doctors a couple times for it that's the thing is i can work with migraines and uh my job has put me in a situation where occasionally i can work from home and my last job i worked at home from my region so i can work through migraines but when my back @@@ that's when @@@ so i just have to go and get seen for that i go to the urgent care clinic sometimes i think my last visit was two sundays ago it's when i threw my back out and i walked in and they kind of treated me like i was a drug dealer yeah what happened was i went in the first time they gave me flexeril and uh ibuprofen and that was like an urgent care @@@ actual visit and i come in and she's like well do you want physical therapy and i say well i went through six months of physical therapy uh i went to a chiropractor for my back back in 2008 i would be out of pain for about six months so i'd been through physical therapy uh i really don't want to go through physical therapy again plus my schedule won't allow it and she changed the conversation now from you know medicine isn't a quick fix isn't a long term fix and so i told her well i didn't come in for medicine as a matter of fact i did not take the flexeril you guys gave me the full bottle was attached i can't be sleepy at work you know they did a x-ray there and uh the chiropractor did a mri and i believe an x-ray uh they said i have like a bulging in my disk and the army said it was i don't know if it was a general classification they said it was a lumbar sprain actually is there any way i can get another one of these this is my initial award letter okay okay what i'd like to be the most addressed is my emotional stability that's a different conversation between the two of them uh the migraine usually hurts the worst but it's the back pain that doesn't allow me to go to work tylenol motrin and i ran out of medication a long time ago i was on imitrex and then i was on percocet for a stent but i didn't like it so i didn't help relieve the migraines it helped prevent the migraines for my sleeping i was on trazodone but i believe towards the end of me taking trazodone i don’t believe it was too successful and it was like uh i would take it i would have a window of sleepiness and that would pass and i would just be up the rest of the night yeah i know i should have been in but i i'm glad to see you hmm okay do they also i also have a clinic by me do they also offer all services at that clinic go in and get physical therapy i live in olympia fields do you know where the chicago heights clinic is okay it's about from here it’s about 50 miles south i work down in the loop i work down around wells but the issue would be like the day it comes ever so often i get like these comp days where i have like today is my comp day i have off i have another comp day @@@ that does give me time to get in for appointments like just a regular uh-huh yeah no uh i'm having difficulty with just being stable emotionally and then i'm also having issues with the whole ptsd and i was seen and i started counseling for that but it was difficult for me to receive counseling and what i got from that was everybody else that was in there weren't active duties they were reserves and so as my conversation was that i'm having issues dealing with these convoys i've been on the stuff i've seen their issues were more along the line of active duty soldiers mistreated us and made it miserable and i talked to the doctor and i was like maybe this isn't for me @@@ you know uh i have and i’m not saying that their issues aren’t serious but i have issues connected to things i've experienced things i've been through over there and their issue they're only problem is about me yeah right i'm not really a when it comes to like work stuff like when i was in the military and in my personal life now when it comes to work and i'm basically directing something or doing something i'm fine in group session as far as me and my personal life i don't do very well with it it brings a lot of anxiety okay i've been through a long list of bipolar medications and the reason i talked to the last doctor and i didn't get any more is because i generally experienced much in terms of side effects uh i would say there were times when i took it - i mean the problems you have in those type of emotions is like you have to actually care so there is – maybe have been a span of time where i was supposed to take it and i did take it and i didn't get anything and i'm like okay for six months i haven't got anything and then like a year later there might have been a time where it'd be getting to me i was supposed to take it and i was like screw this and i'll @@@ taking it yeah that's the kind of problem with the bipolar you know it just depends on what you're feeling at the time unless you have someone to stuff it down your throat i have two uh 18 months and 4 1/2 he exhausts us he's in preschool and he wants to come home and do everything he saw someone else do uh-huh no he's not biting he throws kind throws these tantrum spells so after i usually even though i work eight hours i usually to go down to the city and back and i take the train he usually ends up having to go about 12 hours plus of me being gone 12 hours and coming home that's when he just starts screaming at the top of his lungs yeah yeah he's in a half a day right now we can't afford the full day uh i do have decreased hearing because uh the lack of using ear plugs in @@@ i really don’t notice it until my wife realized how loud the tv is yeah occasionally nauseous i don't know just something that’s how i feel no no okay uh no @@@ i picked up uh my @@@ i picked up my @@@ @@@ like @@@ the muscles it's sore it's sore any type of movement this right here it's sore so even when i bend down yeah i don't even know actually none of that hurts uh-huh uh-huh okay i don't remember ever getting @@@ nothing i can think of no i'm not on that @@@ i had a couple of personal not personal but other questions i would like to see @@@ and then also get my @@@ @@@ i don't know if any of that is applicable to me yeah then i was gonna request @@@ no i'm only 70% and also i was gonna see what it would take to get my rating changed i talked to the va hospital and they said that it’s basically when your symptoms are worse and my symptoms are definitely getting worse @@@ except for like two things did i mention my knee i had surgery on my knee it was back in like 2000 and since then i've been seeing @@@ for my knee pain but @@@ or something um that basically prevents me from one because i’m walking upstairs to the train and you know uh any kind of walking i do hurts when i sit in a car for a long period of time it hurts i try to run to try and get in shape on the treadmill it hurts it's my left knee so between my back pain and my knee pain it basically keeps me from being as physically active as i ought to be i've actually been out of work for about two months just because the knee pain and the back pain affects everything and my flexibility has improved and that's a plus but the knee pain and back pain is just yes i went through physical therapy i was supposed to go back @@@ for that and i don't know if i want to go back to it hello uh yeah i was working some contracts where i didn’t have no sick days or vacation days that i take off uh-huh okay okay okay i told @@@ when i first started experiencing i was like under a certain age i was told that after i turn 28 or something i feel like @@@ in my head because that's when see what’s causing the migraines you know anything about that no i've never had anything i was supposed to cause i was getting out of the army but but @@@ okay just while i was deployed not while i was there this was before i was deployed i uh was running @@@ and i was tripped and i fell forward and hit my head and had to have stitches on the front of my head that was the only uh that and also i was in a humvee accident when i hit my head on the radio that was @@@ that was @@@ @@@ @@@ hmm okay okay okay okay okay what was that those are the shots uh-huh okay and that would go with the bipolar also the knee pain uh-huh but i won't be getting a consult to see the orthopedist for that sort of thing okay okay uh-huh okay uh-huh okay number number number or number number just @@@ @@@ you can leave it on the @@@ if you want to can i use your pen i've got to write down i also got to do the health @@@ i need to have you fill this out @@@ that's why i took the day off okay uh-huh okay that's towards the @@@ they give me an appointment okay okay okay @@@ how long is that gonna take a long time okay @@@ uh-huh okay where do i go first they already have my notes; they'll be ready for me okay thank you

<doctor> what happened okay that's good </doctor> <patient>  </patient>,True,1,True,1,True,True
<doctor> what is your family medical history how old was he when he was diagnosed any family history of uterine ovarian or colon cancer date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ it's been a while ago have a seat how's everything going so far so good yeah where is it do you know what brought that on have you ever had it before what have you done to relieve this it just goes away gotcha are you having any fevers okay any headaches okay um breathing okay with the oxygen using your inhalers alright good are you smoking good are you still taking the montelukast good and you're on three liters of oxygen is that what you've been on for a while good um do you need refills on your inhalers i think you just got refills on a lot of your meds okay good how's the diabetes going good okay uh when you have these low these low glucoses in the 50s do you feel it you did what time was that okay okay okay you felt lightheaded so it seems like what are the dates on all of these so this is from this morning this is from yesterday so this reading right here is it from the morning or the night okay and then what was dinner bedtime was 125 okay the blood pressure's been okay how much insulin are you taking now 74 how long have you been taking 74 hmm i think that might be a little too much for you and how much are you taking at lunch i mean you're taking 74 plus three times a day you give yourself shots twice a day what time with regular insulin or with aspart which kind of insulin aspart or regular regular so you get that in the morning and at lunch time are you feeling lightheaded you have a lot of low readings around lunch okay what time are you so let me understand at night what time do you give yourself the shots the 74 10 p.m and before you give yourself the 74 you take your sugars right okay and that's the lantus and then let me see what else you're taking hold on and then regular how much are you doing of regular okay i think we're gonna have to take you down a little bit so before this week you were doing 70 of lantus at night and you were over 200 and now you're in the 50s hmm how's the diet been are you taking all your blood pressure pills and what time to do you take the 8 at night of regular oh why are you taking it at 10 well you should take the 74 at 10 and then you take the regular before dinner what time do you eat dinner okay so i think that we need to change when you're taking it okay and what time do you take the 5 what time in the morning even though your sugars are so low like that okay i'm not trying to i'm trying to make it so you don't have real low sugars cause i don't want it's dangerous to be hypoglycemic right i want to make sure that we're taking care of you so you give yourself one shot at night at 10 or you give yourself two shots at 10 one shot of the 74 and then you wake up in the morning and then before breakfast do you give yourself the 5 but the 74 you said you give at night right oh you do the 74 twice a day so when you wake up at about 10 let's say 10 a.m. 10 to 11 a.m you give yourself the 74 plus 5 and then again at 10 you give yourself the 74 plus 8 plus 8 okay but you don't eat after i think we're gonna have to change the way is that how they told you to take it because your blood sugars see the 5 and the 8 are supposed to be covering you for your meals do you have breakfast every day when you wake up do you eat lunch what time do you eat lunch okay so you get up in the morning and you eat something okay and then so you only have two meals a day and then you have your dinner okay alright let me think about how we're gonna change this so that you don't get these lows cause i don't want you to get these lows you know cause it's dangerous and you're feeling it right okay let's see what else is going on with you um any more bleeding from your rectum coughing up blood black stools okay are you still taking the ppi the ppi let's see what you take for it um the stomach medicine okay are you seeing the id doctors for the hiv okay good okay and you're on plavix then when do you see the neurologist for the stroke do you go see them have you had any more symptoms and let's see have you gotten your flu shot this year okay when did you get it okay and you'll be due for your um your pneumococcal shot in about six months so we'll give you that um and you had your colonoscopy in

little bit high let's see you're taking i don't know what the you're taking the rosuvastatin you're only 10 of rosuvastatin do you take that every day sometimes i don't want it to i know sometimes the rosuvastatin the statins can interact with the hiv medicines so i don't want to um do too high of a dose let me see what you're and you're taking that every night not missing any okay let me look at um here your lipids were better the last time what happened did you miss any of your cholesterol medicines no okay we'll see what we're gonna do about that okay and let me just take a listen to you

<doctor> how may i help you ok and when did this pain start and is it the right hand or or left hand ok i see and did you have any trauma to the wrist or or any injury or have you had an injury in the past ok and are you right or left handed ok yeah and you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first and then the left one has started since then ok and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located ok and how would you describe the character of this sensation is it burning is it sharp achy or or stabby ok and you have some burning as well ok and is the does it radiate anywhere are you feeling this in in your neck shoulder or down your arm at all ok and do you have any pain in the neck yeah ok an anything that you've done that makes the pain worse ok um so kind of like flicking your wrist sort of thing so kind of shake out the ok um an anything that you do that makes it better besides those moves like have you taken any medications or tried any like wrist splints or anything like that ok and what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the worst you've ever felt and do you feel this pain at any particular time of day more than than others i see ok and have you had any like numbness and and that tingling in the hand or anywhere else ok and have you had any muscle weakness ok and how about any issues with like gripping objects dropping objects or like opening jars ok alright and have you had any fevers or chills have you had any night sweats have you had any unexpected weight loss ok have you had any headaches how about any like sensory changes such as changes to your vision or hearing how about a loss of your sense of taste or sense of smell have you had any runny nose or feeling congested how about a sore throat or a cough have you had any shortness of breath or wheezing have you had any chest pain or feeling as though your heart's racing ok have you had any dizziness or or lightheadedness alright and have you had any of nausea or vomiting and any abdominal pain ok have you had any diarrhea or constipation or blood in the stool alright have you had any urinary problems like pain or frequency alright have you noticed any skin changes or like rashes or anything like that ok and have you had any like muscle aches or or body pains ok and any confusion or memory loss ok uh and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok and so do you take any medications regularly either prescribed or over the counter ok uhm and do you have any allergies and have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries alright and can you tell me a little bit about where you're living and and who you're living with i see and you mentioned you're an accountant are you working right now i see ok and have you been around anybody who's been sick recently have you traveled anywhere do you smoke cigarettes ok and how about smoking marijuana ok so no recreational drugs ok and are you currently sexually active ok uh and any concern for sexually transmitted infection ok um and do you drink alcohol ok um and in the family are there any musculoskeletal or like neurological conditions ok and how about autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or like hypothyroidism or type one diabetes yeah ok alright and was it endometrial cancer i see alright and um so next i wanted to just move to the physical exam portion and so just first inspecting the hand and wrist do you see any swelling or redness how about any changes to temperature do any of the joints feel warm and are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand i see ok and is there any areas of your hands over like any of the joints or over the rest that if you press you feel pain ok and are you able to to move your wrist or the full range of motion ok uh and is there any uh so that then the next test i'll just ask you to just tap on the the kind of base of your palm there with your index finger and middle finger of your left hand and when you do that do you feel any burning or tingling ok so that would be yeah positive tinel sign and do you get any so if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other and if you hold that position do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling ok alright so that was everything i wanted to ask about and check today um did you have any questions yeah certainly so it's sounding like a carpal tunnel syndrome which that the differential would be something like radiculopathy coming up up from the neck which you're not having any neck symptoms and the positive tenel sign and positive phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing and so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position but also uh depending on like if there is inflammation there nsaids might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that but the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time then surgery could be a potential option as well ok okay i did not get the blood report yet i am waiting for your doctor's office to send it to me is it only your potassium that is elevated date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ okay and yourself follow me yeah how have you been which hand is it and the right shoulder it's been going on for the past three months you think and you've been able to use that hand or you still hmm uh-huh you're still able to walk and do everything else and how did you end up falling do you remember for @@@ any lightheadedness or anything any lightheadedness any chest pain or feeling like your heart's racing did you lose any consciousness oh good any falls previously yeah okay i see hmm so as far as the medications you're still up-to-date do you need any medications hmm and that was discontinued or how long ago did you last take it okay @@@ yeah @@@ a blood pressure cuff okay and you're still taking the pantoprazole is that for reflux okay uh-huh and how has your weight been yeah @@@ you been trying to gain weight okay are you exercising uh-huh still @@@ sedentary yeah any burning when you pee or any difficulty urinating any shortness of breath cough i was looking at the x-rays of the wrist various bones and it has like eight bones and so yeah but it still potentially be a bone that's in there so it could be a nerve so just get an x-ray and we can send you to physical therapy as well @@@ means to kind of strengthen the joint if there's something else that's causing problems yeah do you smoke at all it is yeah are you interested in it not just no here they work on diet and various exercise programs that one can do to help people lose weight uh-huh yeah any history of any sexually transmitted diseases that you know of @@@ it's 15 months yeah really i've not decided i have family in minneapolis and pittsburgh so yeah i can't really say we'll see yeah have you ever had an ultrasound of your liver before yeah i think they've been up in the past before they’re up at this time not extremely 60s 100s normal is under 40 @@@ no abdominal pain that you’re having it could be you're not having any kind of muscle aches or anything you've been taking that medication for a while too something i can just continue to watch as well one was 60 and the other one's 100 the first one's supposed to be under 40 and the second one is under 60 yeah yeah i definitely think we should do an ultrasound and check some other labs no weakness or fatigue no change in the skin color rashes or anything joint pain other than that wrist good okay deep breath through your mouth good you can breathe normal do you get any swelling in your legs at all @@@ i've had other patients with that similar yeah @@@ relax your arm not too bad i got 150/78 it should be under 140 so not terrible just lay back for me and you said you didn't take your medications @@@ and just turn your head to the left okay go ahead and sit back up have a seat in the chair that you were any pain are you able to do this and what about the other wrist how far back could you put them and what about when i do this going up the side and this side @@@ uh-huh okay and hold your fingers out like this go ahead and squeeze @@@ now squeeze my fingers as tight as you can i want you to squeeze me just like that as tight as you can don’t let me pull back @@@ your strength is a little decreased is it hard when you try to write or sign your name okay yeah i'll talk with some of the other doctors and i'll be back then yeah uh-huh okay we can see it can cause enzymes to go up as you know but looking at your enzymes from before and it's over years @@@ a while and then @@@ a few times in 2005 up to 2011 you were always high and you were taking it then so i don't know it's interesting to see now and you've had times before they were a little higher we'll @@@ something that hasn't helped you your cholesterol numbers have been good let's take a look at that we want you kind of under 100 for sure and maybe under 70 there are times here you're pretty good like under 70 70 and this time you're up to 104 so you're above where we want you we definitely want you under 100 and so it's a just a matter of statin doing that also weight loss and exercise can play a role in that too yeah you're weight has gone up 10 pounds and so this could be a reflection of the weight more than anything too so something we need to consider to but i'll talk with the other doctor and we'll see the next steps okay okay so we're gonna continue the statin and we'll just recheck the labs in the future at the next visit so we might six months check and we'll give you a blood pressure cuff we'll do x-rays of the wrist we'll do an ultrasound of the liver to see and make sure it's what we think it is this just may be because of they call it fatty liver sometimes fat infiltrates the liver and it can cause these enzymes to go up so we'll just make sure that's the reason behind this and then i'll get you a splint for the wrist you don't want a splint then and then i'll have them send this blood pressure cuff to your house with weight control and @@@ um there’s really just weight and time progressed further and some other risk factors like hepatitis viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis um it can progress further as well yeah your pressure is nearly where we want it to be in fact you can just stay on the same medication that should do it numbers don't prove it yeah you can maybe even schedule it at the front desk so i put these labs in for three months i think i should see you back then just the blood work uh-huh we can see you back in six months uh-huh we'll just do fasting labs in three months’ time yeah they'll send probably a letter i believe okay and you are going to get the x-rays today @@@ definitely any other questions you have did you want to try the move program uh-huh okay alright okay yeah and then labs in three months yeah you can give it up front you can schedule the ultrasound okay you take care @@@ </doctor> <patient> i've just been experiencing a some pain and numbness and tingling in in just my wrist area and thumb middle finger and index finger hum it's the right it's a the right hand but i also find it so starting to happen in the left hand as well but more so on the right hand i feel this kind of sensation over my palms and fingers it started i would say probably 2 weeks ago and it's been i think it's gradually been getting worse i'm having more difficulty at nighttime especially it's also waking me up from sleep and it's yeah just affecting my daily routine my work so yeah i just wanted to understand what was going on no i haven't had any falls no accidents nothing like that i'm right handed yeah yeah and i don't know if it's just 'cause i use my right hand more that i feel more pain and the symptoms but yeah i definitely would say it's worse so the pain i feel like it's more like a discomfort just over the like palm like near the wrist and the lower palm area is where the discomfort is and then the numbness and tingling is just like in thumb an the 1st 2 digits um i would say it's more of kind of like an aching aching pain um it does sometimes turn into kind of like a burning sensation with the tingling but yeah more so on the palmer like on the palm side of things it's more like an aching pain yeah it kind of goes from the palm along so it goes from the palm it goes upwards like to my fingers but also backwards like into my lower arm as well like my forearm in my neck no uh i i just have to like i work as an accountant there's a lot of work i do on the computer with a keyboard mouse so i feel like it's hard to really do that all day right now so i think if i do that i'll make it worse but if i take a rest and kind of just shake my hands a little bit then it gets better yeah no i haven't tried any medications or splints the pain is probably like a a 5 and i feel it more during the night as well as like when i'm working i feel it's definitely more as i continue to do more work no just in the areas that i described nowhere else uhm no i don't think so yeah i i do i do have like when i'm lifting things and opening jars opening lids like i do have the similar discomfort pain as well as the numbness and tingling no no no no no no nothing like that no no nothing like that no ok uhm no nothing like that no no no no no no no no no no i've been fairly healthy no i i've been pretty healthy sometimes i take some advil for headaches and stuff or tylenol but that's it uhm nope no i haven't i'm living with my husband and two kids in a small townhouse yeah i i am in i'm an accounting time off and just taking a little bit easy before i find out like what this is and how this will really impact my work no no no no no no drugs no yes just just with my husband no uh just maybe some wine every other day no in my family history i think there is some there's definitely some diabetes on my father's side but other than that i think one of my aunts on my mother side had um a hysterectomy for cancer not sure actually but she i just know that she had her uterus removed no no uhm maybe like just a little bit like i feel like i've lost some of like the fat pad just right near my thumb um no yeah i can move it yeah yeah i definitely do um yeah i do feel it as well there no i just wanted to know how i can fix this ok sounds good my physician did a blood test my potassium is high he recommended me to meet you yes that's what they told me how you doing good @@@ okay he's been real good my only problem so far well other than the blood pressure that i just found out it was high i fell back in the middle of january i tripped and uh injured my wrist and uh but it's not getting any better my wrist when i fell it swelled uh and there was pain in the shoulders and i get a burning sensation in the shoulders but that's subsided and my left shoulder is a little bit not the same as it was prior to the fall it's not gotten any better the right hand left shoulder yeah and it continues this is minor so the wrist is not @@@ um since the middle of january so about two months i use it but i'll give you i brought this cause i tried to write something the other day and this is what happens with my signature it shook so bad that that's how it looks so when i start when i held the pen it started to shake and that is sort of a representation of what i was trying to write there's pain in this position like that and it's located here and here and this area here so like i can't push down like if i was laying down and to do a push -up or something like that it's different the only other little bitty minor thing would be holding where the incision is on the foot where they did a surgery a year ago and @@@ surgery minor and sometimes there's some numbness in the area but i guess that’s to be expected oh yeah the foot is actually 100% better than it was prior to the surgery oh the first oh okay what was happening is uh a dog a lady and was walking a dog and the sidewalk a tree must have lifted up the sidewalk and i wasn't paying attention to the sidewalk as much as the other dog coming approaching us and there was a change in elevation or whatever between one angle of the sidewalk to the other and i tripped on that since then i've been the townhouse has used asphalt to repair that area so that pardon no no you know i feel fine no i have not no just when i go to sleep although my mother used to say i was unconsciousness all the time uh that's how i broke my foot though back in 2009; i tripped over a drywall lift so i'm not that prone to falling i was looking at a hammer and there was an apparatus there's three legs that come out and i was looking beyond the legs sticking out and i tripped on it i actually didn't fall i put my foot off to prevent the fall and the stress i guess caused the break technically i didn't fall fall okay no i'm okay yet there was one that was discontinued um @@@ i think @@@ a cholesterol no it just ran out gee i don't remember i'd say a couple months ago uh uh zocor and simi-es whatever i can't pronounce either one of those blood pressure was high and then the nurse said something i don't know @@@ but i haven't taken the blood pressure medication today yes i do yes uh-huh it doesn’t stop it as much of it seems like antacids um there was a period where in one week that i got three episodes of reflux and uh aspiration in the lung that's not caused by uh food intake it's based on really how tired i am for some reason uh other than that one week for a three episodes or so very few few and far between it's gaining i think it was around 200 today it's a problem no i was not each night i walk about three miles with the dog and it's not really exercising i'm not sedentary no nothing really other than the wrist right now nothing no just the only coughing occurred after one of those that week there was some sort of mucus coming up from – that subsided shortly thereafter and that was nothing what would be here it's just this part junction right it junctions oh i really hasn’t gotten better it one of those things especially if you fall in front of a woman or a girl you're like it could be broken whatever you just get up and “i'm fine.” then you go home and cry but like it did swell i don't recall any black and blue @@@ but the hand just swelled in this area this side gives me more pain than this side this is the side that swelled no i don't smoke and i don't drink i assume the move clinic it's some sort of exercise program is that somewhere you do cardiovascular what do they do let me see if i could do it by myself but it's something if i can't i would be interested i really enjoyed the cardiovascular program that they had here you know the rehab no how much longer will you be working at loyola uh-huh so where are you hoping to go afterwards hmm minneapolis uh it's kind of wintry up there well not now it was a couple of weeks now people go to new clinics not a bad place most of minneapolis no i have not @@@ enzymes extremely no nothing is that from the @@@ no yes uh-huh hmm now what was it 60 and both of them are supposed to be oh they're elevated hmm @@@ no not really no joint pain here no nothing nothing no nothing this is where the pain with the stents prior to the stents prior to the surgery came from not uh no i don't have anything like that and it was bilateral on both sides and uh on this side so i'm very aware of pain that might originate or doing it hmm yeah no pain not when you touch it i could do it but this is where it starts the pain that's fine i could all the way back; this is where the pain is originating not so much much less than it was the other thing is when i would shake somebody's hand right after oh about a month after shaking their hand would be a problem this was the position that causes the pain what oh um it changes when i write and that was an example of what happens but not all the time only at times okay my liver enzymes they were elevated before i had taken part in a clinical trial many many years ago with the zocor and @@@ they put them together and @@@ medical research and um my liver enzymes went pretty high there and they took me off that study okay i didn't even @@@ yeah depending on my weight uh-huh okay okay okay okay okay okay @@@ ace bandages for support i don’t think so let's see what the x-ray shows first concerned about a couple things one my weight the blood pressure and the liver enzymes and this a fatty what do you call the liver or is that something that will clear up uh-huh i'll try to stay on the same dosage of blood pressure medicine monitor that uh feeling well is deceiving now the ultrasound they'll schedule that okay okay so in three months i would come and get just the blood work and then they would be given to you and then if anything out of the ordinary you'll contact me and you'll reorder the @@@ okay they'll send out a letter or just show up okay and then again if there's something wrong with the x-ray you'll contact me or somebody will okay no nothing my concern were the three things i mentioned the blood pressure the weight and uh that helps with the wrist support thing um let me see how it should come down with the warmer weather and @@@ if it doesn't i will definitely contact you @@@ i did not realize that i was up that high so i'll go for the

cannabis or using any products ok and you use any recreational drugs ok um and are you currently sexually active ok um so no concerns for a sexually transmitted infection at this time ok um and um have you traveled anywhere recently ok but uh and anybody in the family um have uh heart or lung conditions ok um and any cancer that run in the family ok um so uh i think that's everything i wanted to ask on on history today so it sounds like you've been having this cough um that's been going on for just over three weeks now and starting with some um whitish clear sputum and more recently even started to be coughing up some blood as well and you've also been really um fatigued and have had some malaise over the last several weeks um and any other symptoms or oh and also yeah you've had some night sweats chills and uh been feeling feverish as well so we'll certainly check your temperature today too ok so anything i missed ok so we'll get the um testing started for uh for the investigations and yeah if uh at any point symptoms get worse we'll reevaluate tell me what's going on okay let me look at it date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ right on time huh have a seat in there how you doing so when was the last time i saw you do you remember it's been a while almost a year june what can i do for you uh-huh hmm it's call valsartan yeah let me look @@@ how much were you taking before yeah this is on one pill yeah there's a couple of high ones yeah cause i want it at 140 or below you have a couple that uh 126 140 so you didn't have enough huh how many days behind were you uh how many days could you really if it's at 1 1/2 really yeah they'll have to do that cause i'm thinking you have a 90 day supply i can't do math alright you need 90 pills so 90 pills will give one pill for three months if you also need a half half a tablet for so it would be a half tablet x3 x30 yeah it works out to be 135 pills should be enough wouldn't it okay okay how active are you right now are you so do you exercise at all what do you think you do do you walk what kind of exercises okay okay any problems at all or anything else anything that's concerning you yeah uh-huh yeah yeah hmm @@@ sometimes you can injure your carpal tunnel down here where's the tingling anywhere and do your fingers tingle at all which fingers any fingers worse than the others the three here how bad is it and it goes away if you uh-huh yeah okay how's your knee doing yeah well there's some controversy a lot of the pills for arthritis have like glucosamine or chondroitin have you tried using those in the past before so they have those over-the-counter some studies show that it helps; some studies show that it doesn't so i can't say for sure it's supposed to like help lubricate your joints help @@@ yeah jell-o is a gelatin uh @@@ typically those have chondroitin glucosamine and gelatin and some studies show it helps some studies show it doesn't so i can't you know i don't know if it helps or not it can be expensive and @@@ bottle costs like $20-$30 for a bottle yeah and some people say it helps and some people say it doesn't so i don't know if it really does @@@ uh-huh okay do you smoke at all ever smoke before okay you live pretty far from here don't you what if i want you i need you to come back to get lab work done when's your next appointment here do you know do you know when that is this doesn't list any other appointments other than @@@ @@@ when was the last time you saw them august (provider looked in emr) you should just stopped by on your way out of here and scheduled an appointment with them @@@ it's not listed in here you can stop by the eye clinic on the way out and you saw the skin doctor right not too long ago and they took a biopsy alright okay back in august they wanted you to come back in about 9-12 months it should be around now from this summer just stop by on the way out of here yep just have a seat up here is it a big hassle for you to come up here is it a big hassle for you to come to the va where did they do the biopsy the nose okay @@@ yeah i saw that yeah open your mouth say ah okay yeah i saw their note yeah they did a little bit huh deep breath in and out i'll have you lie back here no chest pain or shortness of breath or stomach pain uh-huh okay that's good any pain at all you need to sit back up here who do you live with @@@ oh wow things are okay at home really that's not @@@ yeah @@@ @@@ let me talk to my attending i'll be right back okay alright so we'll just change it back to the 1 1/2 i hope they send you enough this time they may have miscounted let me renew actually all of your regular meds have been renewed except for the valsartan okay i'll renew the valsartan and um no why would you say that (laughter) i don't know where you heard that um okay so what we will do i'll have you come back here in about six months um unless something major goes on then you need to come back sooner than that i want to check lab work well the thing is like i should probably have you come back to see the nurse to make sure your blood pressure is okay okay for a nurse appointment there's nothing in there so what you need to do is on your way down just walk on in for the we'll see how your blood pressure is though i don't think you need to see the nurse cause you can check your blood pressure at home so if there is any problems in your blood pressure and if it gets higher then when you take 1 1/2 a day if you see it getting any higher than 145 call in here let the nurse know and they'll just let me know okay it's just less than but i think that over 145 a lot okay well i would like the lab work in like 1-2 weeks or so whenever you go to get your eye appointment just tell them that your doctor ordered the lab work okay but i would like to get it done within the next month or so okay and now i need to have you come back in about six months um so i'm finishing up in the program in june so when you come back you'll probably be with a different resident um i'm actually staying around i'll be in cardiology so i'll be around it just won't be here yeah yeah yeah yeah you look pretty good huh alright good luck on that lab work okay yeah and then just stop in the eye clinic on your way out </doctor> <patient> hi uh nice to meet you i've just uh been experiencing um a cough for the last few weeks and uh i also recently started noticing that i'm coughing up some blood as well like it's mixed into like sputum i would say it's almost i would say almost like three weeks now uh yeah initially it was just like um kind of white too sometimes yellowish phlegm but now over the last week i've been also noticing um some blood in it as well uh yeah i would say maybe half a half a teaspoon um no i don't think so but kind of like i do feel some discomfort in my chest like i just associated it with the cough uh no it's more of just the discomfort with the coughing uh no nothing like that uh no nothing like that um it's kind of been a bit low over the last few weeks just i feel more tired um yeah i had to miss a few days of work as well uh definitely i feel like i have had some chills over the last week um i haven't had a chance to measure my temperature though um yeah i would say like a few times this week i've also felt like hot uhm now that you mention it like i i would say two two days out of the last week i've had night sweats where my sheets were kind of just drenched when i and then i woke up noticing that yeah i think i've lost maybe 10 pounds in the last couple months no not really no nothing like that no nothing like that no no no nausea or vomiting no no uh no nothing like that no no rashes um no nothing like that no um i've been fairly healthy no um no not that i know no um immunizations are all up to date yeah yeah currently i'm living uh just in um it's kind of like a a home with just a i don't really know the people too well just kind of like a home where um a bunch of guys are just living and working separately i just actually recently moved here from um the philippines six months ago uhm i don't know if anyone else has been sick i haven't really noticed that i don't really see them too much um yeah there's been not anyone that i know of but there's definitely like even where i worked and things like that there's definitely people who have had tuberculosis in the past no no nothing like that uh no uh currently no no um not recently no no not that i know of uh no i think that that sounds great thank you so much yeah sounds good thank you so much and i feel the right side is drooping yeah hi hi how you doing right on time right on the button okay good no i don't remember any of that uh been a while yeah i was thinking like six months june wow that long uh i'm in for a regular check-up i guess uh i wanted to tell you that on the pills that last pill that i was taking that varmazine or what it is valsartan whatever that is i never could get enough of those i'd always run out so consequently what i did is i switched back to taking only one pill so i've only taken one pill instead of the pill and a half before i was taking one pill and then you bumped it up to a pill and a half and i took it for a while then i couldn't get the dag gone pills and uh so i just switched back to spread them out to one pill but here's a listing of my blood pressures i took this is all on one pill if you say so i'll go back to a pill and a half okay yeah i keep running out and i am i think for a period there i was out of pills for about two weeks 1 1/2 so i spread it out to one pill and then i started using what i had i went back to one pill and then since then i haven't changed it i just kept going with it @@@ but if you're thinking the blood pressure's still too high and you want it down i can i got pills now but i wanted to tell you if they're going to get them to me they got to give me more than what they've been sending yeah if they want me on a pill and a half they're going to have to kick up the number by 50% yeah if it would be 90 for three months then a pill and a half would be then another 45 wouldn't it i don't know i been taking them uh i might have some left cause the problem i had is its feast or famine either i have no pills or all of a sudden i got a bunch of them i got enough now i got in that bottle i think that would last me a little bit but uh how long what i really have to be able to do is uh when i run out before i run out i figure about a week or so and then i turn in my prescription for that and then i get them on time i'm very active oh yeah every morning i do about 20 minutes i got uh i walk but i got a regimen of uh exercises that i do they take about 25 minutes mostly stretching stretching and just limbering up and then i walk the dog i walk her every day about at least two a couple of blocks so i’m out but i'm active i'm putting brakes in the car right now and so i'm up and down you know uh nothing except what i wanted to ask you when i sleep at night you know i've been taking guitar lessons so when i take guitar lessons it's hard on your fingers it really hurts like hell so anyway as i been sleeping at night when i lay on my belly i feel tingling in my hand here and i keep thinking that tingling is coming from pressing on the yeah i don't know but anyway i do i do feel that tingling and then it goes away if i roll over and i get on my back it seems to disappear but then it'll come back again and it's like a tingling situation and i keep thinking it's coming from those fingers but i thought i'd pass it by you to see what you thought it just goes up my arm right here yeah all of them they just yeah these are the ones that i use for the cords you're supposed to use four for the cord but i don't use that pinky much no it's just very mild yeah it goes away yeah it isn't it's not enough to wake you up or anything it's just a little it's irritating like you have you ever slept on your arm you sleep on your arm and you get up and you feel a little tingling that's it knee is okay and i had a question on that there's a newspaper ad that says they got a new concoction a pill that lubricates the joints and it does it within a week and i didn't i saved that article but i wanted to ask there is there a pill on the market that is good for the joints that i might be taking yeah yeah no they say take gelatin is that jell-o is jell-o gelatin if you eat a lot of jell-o would that help okay that kills it right there okay well my as long as i keep active and i keep my knee when it gets damp out i've got a support that they gave me a knee support and i put that on and it's the heat from that that seems to help the most and as long as i do that i can get through day @@@ no i smoked uh when i was first in the service maybe oh i might have been maybe about 25 years old so it's been a long time since i but i never smoked cigarettes i smoked a pipe and i smoked cigars then cigars got too expensive a good cigar ran about 75 cents yeah arlington heights i have no idea well wait a minute i got one with uh an eye doctor uh seemed to me that's coming up if you could break into that you might be able to check it no i can't tell you because i don't remember because i complained i'm having trouble reading and they told me last time i was there in three months they were gonna have me in for cataract surgery and i never heard from them again so i asked them what the heck was happening and they said well you got an appointment coming up within a month or two and so i said well i'll just wait for that oh god i wish you wouldn't ask me these questions uh i should keep a record on that but it's been a while august that long wow i got one i don't know when it is though they told me i had one i will they told me i had one coming up yeah i just saw them yeah yeah they took a biopsy on my nose right and that was clear but i have trouble with my eyes cause they water a lot and i keep thinking its they say when you're having trouble reading that's the time you should get these things removed and uh they said it wasn't the right time yeah yeah yeah okay i'll double check if you could then we could make that appointment at the same time what's that no not if it's necessary no i come here but i like to double up on appointments if i can you know it takes me an hour to get here right there on the nose right about there they did find some stuff before and then they did uh they did some cutting ah yeah and they were concerned because they did remove some before that was cancerous nope nope those pills were uh were uh i call them antacids they work great nope i live alone i got a dog me and the dog my wife died about 20 years ago so and i have @@@ my kids are all gone yeah my dog wasn't feeling too good i think she's got epilepsy i see that she fell over and she had went into like a fit and in about three minutes it was over so i got some dog books from the library and they said yeah that breed can have epilepsy and uh i said well at 10 years old you know maybe she's to that point where she can't yeah she's getting pretty old sure okay okay okay it seemed like there was a limit on the number of valsartan i could get and i would run they would tell me that there's no more available is all that heart medicine is that all the same as rat poison i heard that heart medicine is usually rat poison okay okay okay okay okay well can you call the eye clinic to find out if i have an appointment that they don't show on the books i know but then it can help you right now to make another appointment okay yeah yeah i hear you okay i'll do that cause it sure seems like it isn't bad you know it gets down to 132 something and that's pretty good okay okay when i come in to the eye appointment can i automatically go down and get my blood and then great that'll take care of it okay cause right now i'm without a car my car has bad brakes and we're working on it and uh so now i got a driver driving me in and i think i just lost a friend i don't think he'll drive me down again okay oh bummer that's great for you okay okay okay good luck to you great it's been nice working with you every thing’s working good yeah yeah i will thank you now i just turn this in and that's it okay thank you time is

<doctor> um what brings you in today so you've had this when did this start um okay okay what did you is there anything so it's basically worse when you're um doing some sort of an exercise such as walking um or being in the gym class and it's also worse in the cold okay um alright uh um okay sorry one moment okay um so is there anything that makes your cough better what do you do to make it go away and you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it i see so this started a couple of months ago has this ever happened to you before that okay and so i'm going to ask you about a couple other symptoms let me know if you've experienced any of these in the past couple of months um so have you had a headache that accompanies the cough um any changes in your vision or your hearing any confusion um any um runny nose or stuffy nose or sinus congestion okay any sore throat any um chest pain yeah um does it go away when you stop coughing um have you had any belly pain do you feel like your heart's racing any changes in your any nausea or vomiting any changes in your bowel movements any acid reflux okay um and any certain muscle aches or joint pains any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs okay let's get back okay great it sounds like that the the cough is sort of the main symptom here that you have um is the cough dry or wet uh sorry can you say that again okay um have you ever brought up any sputum or any blood okay alright um okay and uh have you been vaccinated okay good good good um does the cough sound like a barky cough or a muffled cough or um does it have a specific characteristic does it sound different than when you're sort of coughing to clear your throat for instance okay okay okay so you're wheezing okay so you ever um cough so much that you end up vomiting um and do you so you mentioned that it's worse when you're in the cold or exercising and smoking makes it worse what about things like dust or pollen um say when you're cleaning the house and there's also dust does that make things worse or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you're outdoors alright uh can you tell me okay so can you tell me if you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with okay had did when you were a child did you have any sort of rash did you have eczema okay and um have you ever had allergic rhinitis which is basically sort of having um red or teary eyes itchiness on the face a runny nose at certain times of the year or in um areas with mold or dust or termites and things like that have you had anything like that as a child or right now okay alright uh do you have any um i guess going back were you a healthy child growing up okay that's great do you uh did you ever have any hospitalizations any surgeries are you taking any medications are you still using the eczema cream okay good are you allergic to anything what happens then um have you ever seen an allergist no uh who prescribed the cream for the eczema okay okay um alright and do you have any family history of any um lung-related problems or any other problems alright and you mentioned that things are going well at school um who do you live with at home okay okay and things are good at home do you feel safe any concerns about bullying at school okay are you uh are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs what about alcohol okay okay just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me um unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um any issues that you have um okay and um are you sexually active alright okay so um that's all the information i needed uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are that have certain triggers uh and also given that you've had a history of eczema and your sister has asthma so kind of sort of runs in your family in a way you might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially um and so what i would recommend is that you get um testing done and um uh i guess before i sort of talk a little more about this i just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma if it's asthma at all um if does it does it affect your ability to you said school was going okay does it affect your ability to do well at school at all does it wake you up at night okay okay um and how often i guess is do these episodes occur how many times a week or how many times a month okay okay uh and they kind of get better on their own okay so we can sort of talk about these sorry puffers that you might need to to use as needed um your sister might have some of those so you might be familiar with what i'm talking about um so we can talk about that um given that your symptoms are yes they've been occurring for the past couple of months but because you have had a cough it might be a good idea just to have a covid test done once um i don't think that's what you have seeing that this these symptoms have been lasting for have been occurring for the past two months so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out um in the meantime i would recommend that you um try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use that you should use on a daily basis and try to avoid uh the triggers so the things that you that cause these symptoms um we can go over how to use uh a puffer properly and i will also give you a spacer which will help deliver most of that medication in the uh to your lungs do you have any questions are you a smoker excellent! have you weighed your self recently and how tall are you that is definitely a possibility we do shrink as we go through life i can have the nurse get your height after we do your exam date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hi nice to meet you how you doing okay what's been going on right you were hospitalized right you're getting short of breath or what's happening

at 150 you've been on 40 for a while right cholesterol medicines oh yes i increased it in july yeah okay you're at 40 yeah so i think your lipids look okay on this when was your last a1c that was this year and you were well controlled and then you had your @@@ done in august and then you were @@@ let me take a listen do you feel like you're just tired and you're weak you don't have energy and this was all after the pneumonia your lungs sound pretty clear you're not bringing up any phlegm @@@ just a dry @@@ let me see what i get here swelling feel around your neck since he was in the hospital @@@ okay @@@ its not hurting now you're not having any @@@ tonsils don't hurt up here or up here okay well you sound pretty clear i don't know if you're just kind of @@@ with it but @@@ 10 pounds yeah the antibiotics caused a bad tasted in your mouth @@@ when you were on that antibiotic oh yeah i could it can mess with your taste a little bit antibiotics have a lot of those side effects but its helping okay for it to come back yeah maybe i mean if he just you just finished the uh uh-huh i'll talk to my attending we'll see it looks like you know your lungs sound pretty clear you don't have much of a cough; it can take weeks to recover you were only in the hospital for three days you know recovering from it four days yeah okay alright i'll be right back do you have a question yeah about a medication or something i'll be back okay alright you remember your question okay oh okay @@@ no you can because you had the pneumonia you should go get it because this isn't going to cause you any negations yeah i mean he’s just getting over like you know every day you're down like i tell some of my patients like every day that you were in the hospital that will take about 4-5 days per one of those days for you to get better and you're kind of prolonged to i don't think you were just over it the four days that you're in the hospital so it's probably so it's gonna maybe take another few weeks or a month you know to kind of get back to where you want i think you can still get the flu shot i mean if you want to wait that's also fine if you're feeling like in a couple of weeks if you're feeling a little bit better it's not a problem you can always drop by and get it alright and then any do you need medications or anything okay um which ones the prior ones okay a lot of yours are just they're okay i've got refills done metformin @@@ okay moxifloxacin i don't see anything else with an m on your except the metformin i'll renew them you already got the labs done; i don't think we need to repeat any of them okay so i think you're okay to go okay i already got all of your medications now if you get a fever or start getting worse or anything call us back yeah if you're getting a little bit worse it'll be fine yeah nice seeing you again feel better okay yeah that's okay it's okay to be in bed okay you're welcome nice meeting you too don't forget your books thank you </doctor> <patient> uh yeah hi i just came in here today cause uh lately for the last couple of months i've been getting these coughing fits they don't really seem to be going away and i was a bit concerned uh i would say probably during the winter uh it it kind of started where i started having um just coughing fits when i'm walking to school and then also during like gym class i started having these coughing fits and sometimes i also felt like i couldn't breathe yeah yeah and then also like i remember when i was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then i just completely just started having that episode right after i walked past them uh i just basically have to if i if i'm doing any kind of activities just take a moment sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own yeah like a couple of times it got really bad where i had to um like it was difficult get it was it was like i was trying to take deep breaths for air but uh it was it just felt like i couldn't no before that i've been fine uh no no no uh no not really uh no um sometimes when i get like really bad coughing fits like it sometimes starts hurting in my chest as well yeah it goes away after i just take some rest uh no not at all uh no no no uh no um no nothing like that no it's usually uh it's usually dry it's usually dry uh never any blood i have like on occasion like sometimes brought up some sputum uh yeah all my immunizations are up to date uh yeah it's like pretty it can get pretty harsh i also noticed like uh there's like this weird noise i started making like right after when i'm trying to take deep breaths in no no that hasn't happen yet uh now that you mention it yeah like if we're ever in the basement or anything like that i i do start getting like kind of irritation um in my throat and that kind of sometimes i have also coughed at those times no nothing else i've been pretty healthy oh i yeah so i did i at one point i was using like this cream um probably when i was ten just for some eczema on my hands uh not that i know of no yeah as far as i know i i didn't really have any concerns from like the school or home at all no no uh no medications no no that kind of just went away on its own or like right after i used the cream like it's good now no i don't think so maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes in the springtime um just sometimes like uh i don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like i i do get some i guess i do get like some nasal congestion and things like that no i haven't um just a it was like at a walk-in clinic um my older sister has asthma and uh i don't know if anyone else in the family has asthma um i think my father has high blood pressure yeah so i live with my older sister and my mom and dad yeah yeah i feel completely safe no no not at all no no my parents would kill me uh i'll come i've i haven't tried it um yet at all no no um definitely in in gym class but other than that it hasn't really affected me no so far no i i like i get pretty good sleep uh so they just started like two months ago and i've had like maybe four or five of them in total yeah uh no i don't have any

<doctor> do you have any major medical conditions that run in your family that i should know about well it could be anything from diabetes to high blood pressure to cancer date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ come on back how's everything going good your blood pressure was a little high when you first came in @@@ running around @@@ rechecked it and it was 136/84 so yeah this time the past three times when we've rechecked it it's always been 120s @@@ are you in any pain today could be that why it's elevated uh-huh yeah did they not schedule your eye appointment well remember we were going to try the physical therapy before we tried the ortho consult and we ordered those films we wanted to take a look at those films so that's why the ortho consult wasn't placed yet because we had ordered those films of your knees to look and see if there were any fracture or dislocation or anything that @@@ images first and the physical therapy is it helping your knees yeah well we should be able to continue that i mean physical therapy isn't usually just one session it looks like you went multiple times okay did you feel like you needed to continue with it okay but did you feel that you would benefit from more physical therapy uh-huh do you feel like it was helping you uh-huh okay it looks like he discharged you from the physical therapy clinic it shows you had had 11 sessions so it looks like you were tolerating the exercises and doing well with the treatment but you don't feel like it was really helpful uh-huh okay so it helped you @@@ but you're still having and it helped with your stability as well no so you feel like unsteady when you're walking okay uh-huh do you take anything for the pain okay is that helping 10 years that's a long time you're putting yourself at risk for a ulcer okay how much naprosyn are you taking and how often do you take it okay but it's not really doing any good okay i would stop it then if it's not helping you because it's just putting you at risk for an ulcer since it's not helping your pain um okay so you those x-rays that we took continue to show the degenerative joint disease and the narrowing of the disk space but it didn't show any fractures or dislocation but we can send you to ortho um now that we have the films and it does um @@@ if you would benefit from surgery they can evaluate you for that is that something that you're still interested in yeah did you go and get the labs done okay so let's take a look at the labs here you went and had blood drawn okay so you don't have all the labs that you need for the colonoscopy can you go down to the lab today for some blood work and we can get that done so could you those were different so before you had you know your cholesterol checked that was back in that was a while back back in november i think yeah back in january when you had your cholesterol getting checked and the hepatitis c and your prostate enzyme all of that good stuff but you didn't get screening labs for your colonoscopy at that time so we need to order specific screening labs first just to review them and then we can refer you for the colonoscopy so no you don't need another appointment i will see the labs and then i'll schedule you for the colonoscopy okay so let's go ahead and order these labs okay that's fine so you’ll go for the @@@ labs um the physical therapy is not helping so we put in for ortho to see you and you want the absorbase you said okay do you want to pick that up today okay and you're using that for dry skin okay uh-huh it doesn't look like that won't okay @@@ where do you use the cream all over so i'll do that @@@ do you want to pick it up at the window also there's the colonoscopy labs you can go for tomorrow uh-huh so what was going on with your eyes uh-huh you had seen them here okay have you been having any vision changes what what kind of changes worsening of the vision just when you're reading uh-huh and you think that um that when you're looking at things far away or close okay near and distant as well okay and then um tell me about are you still taking those antibiotics the amoxicillin that's today okay so you're off of it now and the swish and spit still using that okay okay are you still taking tylenol for your pain @@@ is that helping at all okay @@@ but that doesn't help your knee pain at all okay and you're taking that 500 every six hours okay uh-huh oh you're taking motrin and the oh the okay i see how long did you are you still taking the tylenol and the ibuprofen okay i'm going to take that off your medication list since you’re not using that the ibuprofen so you don't need it for your tooth pain anymore okay so you're not taking the ibuprofen but you're still taking the tylenol okay uh-huh oh okay uh-huh okay i would stop taking your naproxen because it's not helping your knee pain and if you're taking that much of it you're gonna just put yourself at risk for an ulcer oh i thought you said you've been taking oh uh-huh oh because it wasn't helping okay have you ever tried anything called tramadol we can try that for you and the pain do you want to pick that up today too tramadol @@@ consult @@@ eyes you got your flu shot and all of that stuff are you still in the methadone program okay good putting in the consult for you to see ortho right @@@ active right now uh-huh there is no active disease but we'll get the labs so no no not right now no active disease it shows that you had possible; you know you were possibly infected in the past but you're not no active infection right now and your labs are not typical for disease @@@ um they'll probably want to do screening labs when you give blood sometimes patients who have a history of infection in the past they will not allow you to give blood i don't know exactly what their rules are how many year have you had knee pain how many years it's been a lot of years yep i'll be all done and will um yeah that's something i wanted to stay in chicago but i'm still looking for a job so i haven't found one just yet still working on that process it's hard to find a job today now with the economy uh-huh but i’ll find something it’s just going to take time what about you did you find some work uh-huh uh-huh for your @@@ clinic we'll send you to the eye clinic to the ortho clinic colonoscopy labs @@@ a survey @@@ and have you quit smoking yet oh good excellent how many cigarettes are you down to okay how much were you on before you started @@@ okay so improvement so this medication the tramadol it can cause confusion in elderly patients you're a young guy so i don't think you'll have a problem with it so the first few times that you use it make sure that you don't drive afterwards okay good just kind of monitor yourself after you take it and make sure that your mind is still clear you don't have any confusion and it's not making you drowsy or sleepy or anything like that okay and do you want to pick that up at the window as well and you're gonna take that on an as needed basis too okay let me just talk to my boss real quick anything else you wanted to discuss @@@ take a seat up there @@@ take some big deep breaths good your lungs sound good right now after you stop smoking you can prevent yourself from developing emphysema i'm on service right now at the va and we see people coming in all the time emphysema yeah you probably see yeah and asthma too go ahead and lay back @@@ underneath you're able to bend it can you bend it any further nope and how about this one okay bend it again for me did that cause any pain what about this okay but it doesn't cause any pain in the knee okay alright @@@ it looks like you do have some restriction and some stiffness @@@ may be able to @@@ so the left side looked better okay (doctor working on computer) @@@ heading in the right direction huh good for you good where are you living at okay sure well i'll be right back okay sir she agreed with our plan the only suggestion she had was to use just to try diclofenac instead of um tramadol just because tramadol has some addictive properties so it probably would be better to try something without those properties first and try um diclofenac it's a stronger anti-inflammatory medicine it's stronger than naproxen so so we'll try that and you can pick that up today too @@@ yeah it's not really what we use that often but @@@ so cause usually naproxen helps most people but yeah i guess so so let's try something different yeah @@@ i know so if it's helping then they'll still continue it but if it's not helping you then what's the point right it can so they'll probably want you to take it with food they're going to @@@ okay so you take it once in the morning with breakfast and with dinner alright so it sounds like they wanted you to go back up front or go back to room @@@ because the pain scale wasn’t complete do you just want to wait over here in the waiting room okay take care @@@ there you go </doctor> <patient> what do you mean by that oh yeah my brother had prostate cancer i'm hanging in there yeah i know @@@ i'm getting pain today because i'm kind of pissed off actually no actually when i saw you in january you was gonna put some orders in for me to uh have an eye consult no eye appointment no ortho consult no well i let me see i only went one more time because he said uh i don't know he wanted me to continue but but the guy downstairs he and i wanted to continue going but you know i guess he had to he had to get something from you to continue with it and since that didn't happen well i had @@@ i went multiple times i felt i wanted to continue but he said you know i don't know i guess he needed something in writing i don't know i guess he said i could uh but then it was helping with the strengthening you know right yeah @@@ it's just you know it helped with strengthening you know strengthening my legs but but helping with my pain or anything like that @@@ no not really no uh-huh uh-huh and he's the one that gave me the cane uh and then let's see what else naprosyn i've been taking that for so long it's not really effective anymore i've been taking that for you know almost 10 years a long time i alright 250 uh twice a day sometimes three times a day uh no alright um what about the colonoscopy yeah you said you were gonna uh-huh yeah you said you were gonna order me some of that stuff for my skin for the dry skin absorbase never got that i didn't get the labs done i thought i did so okay so after i get the labs done then i'm gonna have to have another appointment or what yeah i'll get them done tomorrow morning i got something else tonight i got to go back there uh-huh yeah sure for dry skin and uh i need to go to the eye clinic uh i couldn't do a walk-in i mentioned that when i saw you in january i tried to go in and see if they had it'd been almost a year that i had been in their so i needed to go our time here all over yes yeah tomorrow yeah what about the eye consult um a few years ago um i started having blurred vision so i came in and with the guys in the eye clinic and uh you know they dilated my pupils and did all that and did some additional tests they said they wanted to keep an eye on something make sure i come back within a year but i kind of you know i didn't follow up like i should have and that's probably why you know they wouldn't let me just walk back in because it had been over a year yes it was something specific that they wanted to watch for but uh some yes uh just the continued uh worsening of the vision yeah uh when i'm reading or you know like when i uh just sometimes during the day my vision will even with the glasses that i have uh i still can't see as sharply as as i used to i think when um normally usually my far vision isn't affected my distance vision hasn't really been affected in the past but that's starting to be affected too so it's both yeah no i'm done with that i'm going; you know i got a dental appointment at 10 o'clock a follow-up yeah that was for yeah that was for dental stuff that i was on amoxicillin yeah i'm done i'm done i'm done with that i'm still using that i got like two bottles at home still yes i am you know i was taking the tylenol and i was taking that for the dental pain cause i gotta a you know not really right i was taking that alternating that with 600 uh motrin so it was like yeah that was for my dental pain though you know i got all my teeth pulled i'm still taking the tylenol but i'm not really taking the ibuprofen as much what unless you can order something different yeah not no alright still taking the tylenol now i take it sometimes but he wanted me to take it you know alternate it you know throughout the day one a day you know throughout the day but take something else @@@ i was doing it that way but you know that was like this will be two weeks now that i had the dental work done and uh like i said i'm having my follow-up today i still got some sutures in my mouth they gonna remove @@@ uh-huh right i and i hadn't been taking the naproxen anyway i had been taking the advil you know i had been taking the naprosyn like for years but then i ran out i didn't try to get anymore wasn't helping tramadol no no okay yeah yeah flu and pneumonia i got all that yes now you said uh remember i told you i didn't tell you my story about the hep c @@@ okay so i don't need to go to that the liver clinic or anything like that okay its borderline or anything it's okay uh-huh so could i give blood okay and the only reason i asked that uh i have a common type ooh well let's see i first injured my knees in the 80s yeah 87 yeah 30 years 87 this is what @@@@ yeah that long yeah it's been a while too long that's what they say is chronic so you're leaving in june so is you all done or you going somewhere else staying in the chicago area hmm really wow yeah no you know i had an appointment to go to the uh our regional office on taylor street i'm in this program to get retrained and possibly get a job so my schedule has been kind of heavy to where they're scheduling me for appointments and not talking to me first so i've been having to cancel those appointments and they just called me now and are gonna call me back this afternoon i'm just saying this uh yes i'm looking i'm looking i just don't want to jump into

now alright yes okay no with emphysema yeah like in the smoking cessation class almost all the guys almost all of them have emphysema and asthma yeah yes part of that without hurting nope this one's kind of not as bad like the last one so no that does especially in the hip not in the knee no it's worse than that that's also the one that locks snaps and pops all the time right yeah @@@ all those crazy wild days are over uh presently i'm just staying with my mom it's a temporary situation of course uh when i get back to working alright what is that that you said what is it okay i haven’t heard of that one unless they've been taking it forever huh it used to work i been taking it for a long time i'm surprised no one's ever suggested coming off of that and trying something else @@@ they always ask me how long have you been taking it and i tell them and they just keep prescribing it switch up from time to time anyway though i think you know will that cause ulcers too yeah i always

<doctor> so what brings you in here today ok so just to kind of get a timeline what kind of started first ok and have you had any of these symptoms before ok alright have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow how much of the discharge are you having like in a day ok and have you been having any fevers or chills ok and did you recover from it like on your own ok so it was just you just had some cold-like symptoms ok alright have you been coughing at all ok any sore throat any trouble breathing any loss of sense of taste or smell ok and did that come after the congestion or was it present before ok and would you say you're still pretty congested ok and has it been getting worse would you say or do you feel that it's getting better ok and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion yeah have you tried any medications over the counter medications at all ok and so you've tried nasal sprays have you tried any of those like nasal rinses or anything like that i see ok any recent contact with anyone who's been ill or any recent travel ok any nausea or vomiting any fevers or chills any fatigue ok and how many days would you say you've been feeling tired for ok and do you feel that you know you're having some discharge but do you feel that there is mucous building up and dripping down your throat or anything like that ok and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad or have you noticed it yourself ok yeah sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well so yeah just wondering any chest pain at all constipation or diarrhea any issues with urinating any changes in your sleep or appetite ok is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried ok so this has been going on for just remind me again like the last four day ok do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past ok alright so have you noticed at all any weight changes ok and have you been exposed to like fumes or dust or how do you have any animals or pets at home ok and do you take any medications or anything regularly ok and do you know if you have any allergies ok any previous hospitalizations or surgeries ok right and do you have any family history of any conditions like any lung conditions heart conditions any cancers ok and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma ok and do you currently smoke cigarettes do you drink alcohol any recreational drugs like marijuana ok a joint or two ok and is that is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms ok alright yeah so those are all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions at all for me yeah so from the symptoms that you're describing it does seem more like sinus issues there's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure that's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face it's because of a sinus infection most likely and usually like it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own we usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses and then some oral decongestents or have you tried any anti histamines ok so no antihistamines it seems most likely that you have a sinus infection it can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well so we can give you some antibiotics so will give you some amoxicillin so it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms right and you haven't had any high fever or anything like that have you measured your temperature ok ok since it's been three days what i'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel and will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done does that sound good ok you're welcome and hopefully you feel better take care the nurse applied antibiotic ointment and a bandage to your foot did she go over how to change the bandage at home date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ patient hi good how are you patient good you had a bit of a sun burn huh were you outside oh do you put sunscreen on oh good your skin is fair so you should probably put sunscreen on lots of it what spf do you use have a seat for me have a seat spf do you use 30 or 15 or what okay oh good oh good alright what can i help you with today sir okay celebrex huh you're not taking that here okay sure um is it arthritis pain or just is it a new kind of pain is it a new kind of pain or just like before it would help okay uh-huh yeah are you on your ankle are you on your feet every day or yeah is it worse at the end of the day okay do you have you tried elevating them so does it help oh good okay any numbness tingling your appointment is 10:30 though okay okay yeah okay okay any numbness any tingling any weakness in the legs or is it just the swelling uh-huh lisinopril it's for blood pressure do you still take it okay metoprolol yeah nifedipine yeah okay metoprolol yeah so yeah it would be good um it would be good for you to bring the bottle cause i don't cause when you bring it like that i'm not sure okay you haven't it's for blood pressure lisinopril yeah oh you still have refills on it have you been calling them and ask them to (someone knocks on the door and the doctor visits with another person for a few minutes) sorry about that sir yeah right right oh okay it looks like you have two refills left so it must have been that when you called them to ask them to ship your maybe you didn't ask for that @@@ okay hmm i wonder what happened yeah do you still take cetirizine for allergies okay how long have you been on the hydrochlorothiazide yeah the blood pressure pill so a long time years for almost a year oh yes i remember yeah no leg cramps muscle cramps or anything no okay yeah and you're taking the um you're taking doxycycline is that for the rosacea okay you see

next year you'll get that yeah no weight loss it's getting better no weight loss no fevers no chills no night sweats nausea no vomiting no belly pain yeah yeah so you didn't take your meds yet right uh-huh uh-huh that's that's borderline you don't have heart disease you don't have diabetes right so what's the goal for you the goal for you is to be less than 140/80 you're borderline right so i would rather you be in the 130s so the fact that you didn't take your medicine today and if that's the right right and the fact that you haven't been taking the lisinopril cause the lisinopril will drop your blood pressure too so that could be the reason in the morning take it in the morning uh-huh take the lisinopril and if you feel lightheaded or dizzy check your blood pressure and if it's too low like too low less than 100s then you can call me and i'll have you come back in about two weeks okay uh for blood pressure checks and we'll see where we are sure do you have an appointment then

draws now do you see a primary care doctor on the outside too or is it just the chiropractor ah no cough no postnasal drip no your hearing is okay alright with the hearing aids okay do you think the rosacea is better with the cream @@@ you don't use the cream okay deep breath in and out do you have pain pain any constipation diarrhea go ahead and lay down for me diarrhea constipation black tarry

anyone gotten like an x-ray of that area okay okay umm okay yeah okay okay hmm the what the lisinopril no no you know um i don't i mean sometimes one of your medicines can the nifedipine can do it nifedipine might do it it's new you know it should not i don't know it shouldn't yeah um alright what else do you need so we'll get labs yeah june 19th you can come back for a blood pressure check to when you're taking the lisinopril okay do you want to pick up the lisinopril today in the pharmacy so you can start taking it i'm not sure i'm not sure are you in a hurry today if you are send it to you yeah yeah no no it should be okay i'll have it sent to you and you come back on the 19th yeah we can try some celebrex yes do you want me to send it to you to how often are you using it okay right it's worse when you move around right when you walk and you move around when you're golfing and it helped good where did you have that shot was it on the outside that you had it oh okay yeah okay umm okay okay sorry to hear that let me go get stuff for you um i'm going to get an appointment next time appointment for you get labs for you when you come on the 19th and hopefully you'll get that medicine dermatology right okay you can do it after or before whichever you prefer i'll be right back alright yeah um um so one thing is um i'll send you the lisinopril unfortunately i was asking one of the doctors who's worked here for a longer time than i did i am um; they say that celebrex we have to get special approval because it's expensive and you know how especially at the va so let me let me try to get that for you okay i can put in a consult through the system they'll review it and they'll let me know if you can get it for you some patients are on it i can make sure that you know in your case it's indicated which i think it is but i'll let you know but if not you can always ask your outside doctor to prescribe it for you too but i'll let you know though i know yeah let me let me work on that for you i want to get you and come back on the 19th for a blood pressure check okay and then lab yeah so that would i can get yeah; i'll check liver function at that time too so i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna do this is june 19th okay i'll put in the labs and then you can see me in six months obviously if you @@@ need to and then yeah if you start again if you start if you start to feel that you know propping them up isn't helping as much or if you have any numbness or tingling and you think it's getting bigger call me and let me know i think it's a little bit of that medicine that you're on nifedipine it can give you a little bit of swelling so i just don't know which one nifedipine that's the and uh the calcium channel blocker so let me i mean let me know i mean since the medicine is

days i'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose i can't seem to smell well and i have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well so first my nose was kind of stuffy and and then i started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then i kind of lost some of my smell and then now my head hurts it's not even like it's not like a headache it's like a facial pressure no never like probably enough to fill the inside of my palm uh no nothing like that i did have what they thought was a viral infection a week back yeah it went away on its own yeah that's right uh no no no i guess loss of smell the loss of smell came after the congestion i think so yeah um i would say it's getting worse it's the...it's the pressure in my face it hurts i tried some nasal sprays and like decongestions but it's not really helping yeah and they don't seem to be helping uh no uh no no uh i would say for the past three days yeah now that you mention it it does feel like that oh gosh i hope not no no one said that no no chest pain no no no issues there well i guess sleeping is a little bit harder now because of the pressure in my face but other than that no like just the positions of how i'm sleeping sometimes helps yeah yeah the last three days last three days no not that i can think of no no nothing like that um no i just take some multivitamins i just have some i just have some seasonal allergies uh no actually i had my appendix taken out when i was 12 um i know that there's some asthma that runs in the family no i live in a house with my husband and my 3 year old daughter no i don't um i'll smoke a joint or two once a week uh that's just recreationally uh no what was like what do you think i have no i haven't sure i haven't i haven't no i don't feel hot though yeah that sounds great thank you thank you you too yes yes how you doing i'm doing fine right oh i play a lot of golf yeah yes i do yeah okay i don't know what it is; it's called sports block or something i see a dermatologist here too i go in this month too it's on uh let's see well uh um i wanted to check on my medications you know what i've been having trouble with my back and my shoulder and my wife takes celebrex so we tried i used some celebrex and it went away and then i quit taking it and it came back and then i used a few more and it went away yeah no i'm not and so i wanted to find out if i could if i could get my own celebrex and well it must it must be well i used to take it occasionally i mean i would take aleve before i'd play golf and it would help and now i haven't taken any aleve since i take the celebrex so it has to my shoulder and my back it must be and i do see a chiropractor on a regular basis every six to eight weeks and so i wanted to find out about that and you know a lot of times my blood pressure's still high and it probably let's see today it was like 140 i think and uh and in the afternoons my ankles have been swollen up i walk i walk every morning about a mile and a half i play golf i'm on my feet a lot i put my feet up in the evenings and it it seems to go away and when i wake up in the morning they're normal but i've been sitting a lot now out there i've been here since 8 o'clock i know but they called and told me to go to the lab very early and uh traffic wasn't as bad as i thought it would be so i know since i well i got to the lab about 20 to 9 no no it's just it started happening i think in january we noticed it started happening and i was looking at my list of medications and i don't i don't know what this one is i don't think i have any of that yeah what is that i take uh; i take the pink one in the morning which is hydro something and um and then a half of meta something yeah yeah i take a half of that and then at lunch i take here i didn't take them today cause i'm fasting uh i take this pill which is nifedipine yeah at lunch this is the one i take at breakfast along with the half of that and then and then at night i take another half of the meto yeah yes along with the simvastatin well i know what they are but yeah but this one i haven't been taking this one no i don't know what it is okay so for some reason they haven't been oh that's no problem um so the lisinopril i probably should be taking that and i don't i don't even know what it looks like uh some of them they automatically come and then if i running low and i'm gonna go out of town or something i call and order it so i have to order that lisinopril uh-huh i'm sorry yeah yeah i do yeah hydro oh the pink pill since the beginning yes well you're the first person i've seen well i mean it's worth taking @@@ or something before it was all in one and then we split it to the hydro and the metro or whatever they call it i can't metoprolol tartrate they split with that and uh hydrochlorazine i get a uh once in a while i get a muscle cramp you know in here but i don't think it uh it's nothing that happens all the time you know it's like yes yes i see her in about another ten days uh yes actually my lungs are getting a little better the last time it was about 15% better i don't have heartburn ever since i started taking a pill well i take uh; i started off with actually years and years and years ago when it first came out the prilosec and now i take the omeprazole which is cheaper and it works just as fine actually every three years i have a scope done with my uh outside doctor yeah he'll probably call me and i put it off for a while it's getting better no night sweats or anything no nothing no i just i'm still concerned about my blood pressure though because like i take it at home and i have a machine this morning i took it it was 140 something over 66 no i hadn't taken any meds but i took it this morning just to compare with what would happen here you know it's 139/70 and uh you know no yeah i want to be so would i yeah but i don't usually take my blood pressure early i usually take it in the afternoon okay when should i take when should i take the lisinopril with the other pill too but it'll never be low uh can i do that on the 19th cause i have an appointment with the dermatologist everything's fine blood sugar oh okay no i mean no i haven't needed to i could if i wanted to but i ah ah no with my hearing aids hearing is fine yeah yes yes i don't use the cream i haven't had to i only take one pill no no lay down no thank god what was the first one no no oh oh i uh i scratched something on it it’s okay it'll quit uh no no yes well i had some pain every once i got hurt when i was a kid and i got uh um so i go to the chiropractor uh quite often and i think it's getting a little arthritic so i was trying to um keep my golf game going and then i uh and i got uh to where i've had to take aleve oh i scratched a thing there there was a little spot there and i was sitting here and i scratched it so i did the um so i my wife said why don't you try one of my celebrex so i took i took it for two days and it helped so then i thought well so i went off and then it came back and then i took it again and it went away it's back in here back here right about in here it stays there no no well you know i used to drive a lot when i was in uh when i was working i had i worked a lot in the car so my leg would get sore so i this might all be related you know but uh when i gave up my sales i had to drive for sales and when i stopped doing that it kind of went away no no no i'm good i was taking aleve or um advil that kind of stuff and and uh now i haven't been taking any aleve no advil well my chiropractor oh yeah yeah cause he works on it i think it's something that uh um when i was a kid i had a bout with some railroad ties lifting railroad ties and that part of my back went out and every once in a while if i turn the wrong way i can hurt it i mean it's just like if you're off balance and you lean some way you know and it goes right back to that same spot you know but i think that because of all this it's probably become arthritic so you think the uh this lisinopril or whatever might might help the swelling down too yeah what's causing the swelling in the ankles it just seems like it didn't start for uh till about i don't know last december or january okay you need one more lab huh okay will they have it ready for me or i'm not in that big of a hurry i mean i mean we can just you can just or it could be sent to me you know i mean it's not like that critical i don't think just have it you're gonna have it sent to me then okay can we try some could we try some uh uh are you gonna get me a prescription for that yeah have them send that to me i wouldn't take more than one a day and i probably wouldn't take one every day if i didn't have to you know i mean i would probably take it um mostly golfing or uh then my you know i do a lot of i do a lot of woodworking and i keep very busy i do painting i do all kinds of stuff so uh my shoulder was bothering me and then i had a shot last year um a cortisone shot and it helped and then all of a sudden it come back and then i started taking the celebrex and it went away outside yeah and my wife has uh osteoarthritis so she's had joints replaced two knees a shoulder and two thumbs and she's ready for another shoulder what are we getting okay i think my appointment on the 19th is around 10:30 okay fine fine i got to remember not to wear shorts when i come back it's too cold in here okay yeah yeah i'd rather get it through the va because its okay blood pressure check yeah and then lab now that's for the kidney right does that also test liver functions too yeah yes uh-huh so what i shouldn't worry about my ankles then unless they've started getting numb or something the one i take after lunch it's uh yeah it's uh yeah i have the okay yeah i mean um you know they i was only taking a half dose of the nifedipine yeah and now they doubled that yeah to 60 it was 30 and they went to maybe

might skip a beat that's probably more your heart and it's not uncommon actually to have skipped beats i get them sometimes too i can feel it um if you get it it's a normal thing it's not a big deal um but when it happens more often or you start to feel short of breath or pain or you start to have symptoms because of it then we start to worry um so i don't know no pain at all oh okay yeah we've looked at your heart a few times and it looks okay actually it looks okay no the lisinopril it's the blood pressure medicine and it helps you with depression too it helps your heart it's a good medicine alright so what else shall i do here for you so i think we can increase that do you need refills on anything else okay are you still smoking when did you quit smoking oh great okay okay so you've stopped for good now that's good well that's great okay and you never and you've had high blood pressure for now long yeah uh-huh okay so yeah it was better yeah still a little high we can get it better but it's not bad it's actually not bad have you thought about whether you want to do a colonoscopy for the colon cancer screening we talked about it last time yeah you don't want to do it okay yeah yeah it looks okay alright have you had your flu shots h1n1 you want to get that today okay i had to get it it's actually a little bit more mild than the other two shots depending on where you have it oh yeah right i think they got it straightened out they got it straightened out so you were taking medicine for your stomach for your acid reflux before called omeprazole or prilosec or prevacid kind of thing you were having reflux the acid reflux symptoms i think that was why you were on it do you tend to have it yeah it suppresses the acid in the stomach so there's less acid in the stomach which means you get less symptoms of reflux coming up that would cause you know like burning you know belching getting up at night mainly burning pain at night and after meals are you having any problems with that okay but at night do you get burning sensation or a taste in the back of your mouth okay so you probably don't need it anymore hmm you don't need that okay but you can take it you want to if you feel that yeah you can choose i mean if you start to get that burning acid reflux feeling like after you eat a meal you just gas pain you can take then well the fluttering probably not but you know like if it's skipping a beat @@@ sorry to keep you waiting um okay so we're just gonna do one thing today that’s it we're gonna have you go up to the third floor of the damon building and get an ekg of your heart today and um when you get it come back down to the clinic and one of us will take a look at it yeah you'll go up they'll put some stickers on your chest they'll take an ekg uh make sure that the rhythm is okay um uh-huh oh okay did that help oh okay alright well if that's helping you feel like has it gotten better recently the fluttering it has good okay well why don't you go ahead and have this because it's a really quick thing um and then come back down here and to this hallway and we'll take a look at it oh yeah h1n1 yeah you can get that yeah so yeah the reason i want you to take the lisinopril the lisinopril that you take i want you to take instead of taking a half tab take one whole tablet daily instead of taking uh 10 mg a day you'll take 20 mg a day okay uh and i'll change it in the computer so when they send it to you in the mail you'll get more @@@ the third floor of the damon building yeah it's called the heart station okay alright we'll see you a little bit later </doctor> <patient> i've had this like pain in my knee it started within the last few hours and my knee's swollen it's painful um i can barely move it it's the left knee an no no trauma uh or anything like that i've never hurt this knee before in my life uh um no nothing in my joints i've had other infections before like in my skin um like cellulitis but i i've never had a knee knee problem like this before uh i i had it over kind of my uh like over my foot before i would say it's like my whole knee it's like uh i don't know it looks like it's going to explode it is yeah it's really red and warm as well it's a a stabbing pain uh i would say both i can't um i can't really move it it'll give me pain and even pressing on it it's it's quite painful uh it's a 9 um i mean just trying to stay as still as possible is all i've been been doing so far uh because um like any type of movement is really bad uh i i was pretty much like hopping on one leg to to get in here and as soon as i could i got in a wheelchair just because it uh hurts so bad no just it's just my left knee um i have felt uh uh feverish yeah but then yeah i i felt feverish and um but i haven't had any chills though uh just like today it's kind of yeah it started within the last day um no no i didn't get to uh i i didn't check it uh no i haven't had any anything like that uh i don't think so i've been just in well in the city i haven't traveled anywhere and i uh i haven't been sexually active for for quite a while now so no nothing done to my knee it's really painful i uh the movement's really limited yeah it's gotten uh like it's it's gotten slightly worse no it's just the red knee uh no no i haven't had any changes there uh no i haven't had any of those symptoms no no weakness uh i've been told my my blood sugar has been like it hasn't been controlled so yeah i think i have diabetes um uh but that's that's it uh yeah i i take metformin and um and uh yeah that that's all i've been taking but i mean it's really hard for me to uh like get my medication sometimes and so um i don't always take it uh not that i not that i can think of and so something that i forgot to mention is uh like i've had hepatitis in the past as well um and uh yeah um i've had it was uh hepatitis c and uh i was um treated i was treated for it that was about uh two years ago uh well like any anything that i that i can usually but i i guess like um various types of opioids are kind of the the the main thing that i'll that i'll use uh yeah i about uh about two days ago was the last time yeah i'll smoke uh smoke marijuana as well and um like i'll sometimes like i'll take uh pills too like dilaudid is um is something that i'll i'll get my hands on but it can be expensive so um just just whatever is available uh he last time was about six months ago uh i was treated as an outpatient for that and it did clear up it wasn't the first time that i've i've had cellulitis and and um yeah so it was treated um no i haven't uh i don't think so uh so um i just live with uh two of my um or actually sorry no i live with my uh with my parents and uh yeah so it's just both my parents uh i was working until like i um yeah about uh about 15 years ago and now i like i got injured on the uh um at work and i've had like chronic back pain and i don't know i think that's kind of how this partly all all started so i've been at home receiving uh i'm on disability uh i do yeah i i i smoke um about half a pack uh to a pack a day uh so this has been uh about 20 years um sometimes yeah i'll i'll have uh just a few beers maybe a few beers a week yeah it it's really painful i just i try not to move it at all yeah all of those no those feel fine i can move my hip and ankle okay and no pain okay uh thank you yeah that that sounds good right thank you okay thank you oh it's been about thirty five years now well um i've been taking insulin for about twenty years now yeah um prostate cancer i've had radiation oh my p s a is zero point zero one by the way date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ i'm okay how you doing @@@ was it september okay oh yeah and that was when uh they took me off those water pills yeah and that seemed to do it you know it looks like they was making me feel tired yeah so i feel better now but uh yes i think why at first i thought it was the @@@ but it was doing it it make me feel tired you know but uh the water pills he cut me he took me off the water pills i was taking a half of them right and then too i had a little @@@ here that uh i was a little tired and @@@ a little stronger okay is there any medicine that i may cancel uh @@@ yeah i wants to know if there are any that i am taking that i shouldn't have shouldn't take uh-huh i take uh about six different medicines now including the aspirin i take uh omeprazole and uh not water pills yeah for the cholesterol yeah i need that one and uh the what oh right yeah yeah and there too i got a notation of my blood pressures uh @@@ okay and uh you know i don't feel no pain or nothing but for the last about couple two or three weeks it feels like a little blood around my @@@ uh-huh i told the lady about it that was taking my blood pressure a while ago and she said tell the doctor uh it feels like just like when i take a belch it uh then it feels better you know there's no pain just a lot of @@@ right here it now that seems like a little thing and then sometimes it will skip a lot of beats though oh it just it mostly uh when i do a little extra work uh moving around you know i feel it no no uh-huh i got stairs just when i get a little tired doing a little extra work or something there's no pain just it feels like it's just a flutter uh-huh and when i think that like i belch or something like that uh and then it feels like it goes away no no no off and on oh practically uh every day yeah off and on and sometimes i was wondering if wasn't gas around my heart or something hmm uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh hmm there's no pain no pain cause i have a certain alert @@@ you know before i went in the service the doctor told me i had to go to a doctor once and he said uh the army would never take you oh i said why and he says because you have a weakness of the heart and then he said well if you happen to live right he says because at your age you would outgrow it so like when i went into the service i took my physical to go into the service and in the service the doctor looked at what the other doctor had told me a few years ago and he said no he said your heart is alright now yeah he said if you had a weakened heart we would not take you in here i think i have all of the questions that i had to ask you right here oh yeah and you think i should increase what'd you say the what is that uh cholesterol oh for the blood pressure yeah hmm oh oh i think i actually i need refills on practically all of them but see i have some medicine but i think they all is low they need to be updated no no i don't smoke and don't drink no more cause they told me not to drink and don't smoke oh 2001 that's when i was told and then i told them i didn’t quit drinking then they asked because i was a heavy drinking and i said i wasn't gonna throw it away but i said when i finish i would stop then i ended up stopping for maybe a couple years and then i started back for about six months and then i stopped again and that's it i have hung it up for good oh i don't know but it was during the time i was drinking they said that my blood pressure was high but i think it was because i was a heavy drinker and uh that had something to do with it but now it at first it would be kind of be normal like you know but then all of a sudden it started going back up again and i know she checked it over here just a while ago and it seemed to be high i guess because i told her i had been drinking some coffee this morning and then she took it again and it was it was much better yeah uh yeah for the colon uh now i don't have no problem uh you know no pain around my rectum and i don't have no bleeding and nothing like that so uh i'd just rather hold off on that for a while and what you call the other prostate i had that and it came out good so i had that no i had one shot she gave me but they didn't have the swine flu you know what you call it the swine yeah they didn't have that in at the time yeah i can take that shot @@@ yeah i know that they was talking about it they had to send it back in and it wasn't right or something like that but i guess they got all that straightened out yes yeah that's what i was concerned about now what was that really for it was a capsule no uh i think i was taking it because i was a heavy used to be a heavy drinker and it what is it for for gas or what now i the only problem i have mostly is like a try to clear my throat like that and no yeah that's the only thing i thought it was for; for like to clear my throat like at sometime i had the and uh do that but otherwise if it was for acid or something coming up i mean but i still have some @@@ you know i taste them uh it'd be up to it's just really up to me oh okay uh-huh the gas @@@ i was wondering if that was caused my heart you know yeah and it just goes like something like fluttering when i'm okay okay okay uh-huh uh-huh okay come back here yeah uh again i was wondering about me when i was taking the medicine the one time i was i was taking uh the @@@ you got too many pills at one time i mean you know right together but i started spacing them off now i take two uh in the morning and you know and then i wait i take them about an hour apart yeah yeah that seemed to be helping because when i was taking too many at one time it look like that when i started getting it uh-huh oh yeah yeah i can still go over right right right and you said to get the flu shot or something uh when i come back you updated all the medications right uh-huh the what uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay okay okay then okay so @@@ oh over there uh-huh okay okay man dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1255166 transaction # 578-10-2-316-0103

incontinence uh type 2 diabetes uh i um insulin for diabetes uh just been taking tylenol for the the back pain uh maybe it's taking the edge off a little bit but it hasn't done too much uh to help the pain uh nope uh i had hemorrhoids removed three years ago uh no it was just day surgery uh my father had prostate cancer uh i'm a retired school teacher i live alone um in a in a house uh not too far from here actually um occasionally uh maybe i'll have a glass of red wine on the weekend or something like that but uh not too often uh i've smoked um yeah i smoke a pack of cigarettes uh per day uh

vocal on old people are hard of hearing you've got to @@@ what's the matter with it what was what no it's not not yet okay alright no uh maybe if it gets up about 300 might be high i only get i know when my blood pressure's high when i get a pain behind my eyes and my head hurts really bad then i know i got high blood pressure other than that it works fine uh it gets too low i can't do nothing all i do is sit around and do nothing and pass out uh what you people want 130 over whatever i can't get down that low if i go that low i can't move i got to be able to have a little blood pressure it's just like in a car when the oil pressure is high the car runs good when my blood pressure's high i run good huh no i can feel it when it's high oh well where it's at now it's not bad i would say fair to midland right there it goes down though it goes down pretty low after i'm up out of my car for a couple days yeah expressway driving gives me high blood pressure because i think there's close to 90 million of them out there that don't know how to drive my car is a testimony to that my car is 15 years old and never been in an accident young kid who lives out in the western suburbs drove all the way over by where my house is just to run into me on my side of the street he ran head on into me uh just about a month and a half or two huh did i get hurt just my hand i uh sprained my wrist but it's alright now uh but the thing is the insurance company wouldn't pay to fix my car because they said it was too old they gave me lot value for the car which is not what the car was worth that car was offered 20 grand for the damn thing and all they gave me for the car was $1800 to fix it and it was $3000 worth of damage they only gave me $1800 i was offered 20 grand for that car that's $20,000 and i refused it you see because i liked that car it's a 96 oldsmobile it's the last one of its kind made so it was worth a lot of money it was worth more than 20 grand seeing that it was the last one made the kid wanted to buy it he offered me 20 for it i told him to go home and get some more money he asked me how much i wanted for it and i said well seeing that it's the last one made you got a million dollars i'd sell it to you but some other jerk had to hit it now it was in an accident; i got to get a bumper a new dash steering wheel uh the grill in front a fender and a hood and all that plus its gotta be painted and the guy i took it to talking about $3000 i said yeah could you do it for what the insurance company paid me and then he laughed at me no i oh well uh i'd say it gets around 180 around 180 185 something like that that's kind of low but when it gets really low i don't know what it is i just don't feel like moving at all i just sit there and fall asleep you know but that doesn't bother me falling asleep because i only get like three or four hours of sleep at night i got bad sleep problem yeah i listen to music it soothes me really good and uh i'll keep it no i don't want it i don't want anything to lower it anymore it's kind of low uh-huh it was 216 yeah i don't have a headache when i get a headache i just rub my temporal lobes here on both sides and i hum and it goes away blood pressure goes down the head don't hurt it's something that whenever something strikes me and pisses me off real bad then my blood pressure goes high my blood pressure goes high when i'm babysitting and i baby-sit seven days a week for my two daughters i got two grandsons with one and one with the other one uh they're little sons-of-bitches they are i tell you if i don't get buzzed real good while i'm watching them if i don't get a good high or something oh yeah uh-huh huh last time i baby sat every day so then it calms me down and then the kids could tear the house up

first that's how i remember to take the rest of the stuff because if i take that the rest of the stuff is right there with it so i take that then uh i take the green tea extract it's to improve my vision it's got other stuff in it too it's supposed to help your eyesight i don't know cause i just started taking it about two days ago you know um let's see there's other stuff i take potassium and magnesium vitamin d vitamin d3 and um what the hell is the other one msm i don't know what the hell it stands for but it's supposed to uh be for your skin and bones hair and everything and then i take a how did i come about taking these uh i subscribe to a health letter from mayo clinic and stuff like that and uh they uh you know send out what you need for different things so i buy them and i use them um another one i got out of a medical book was called propellus i don't know if you know what that is it's uh you take that along with the rest of your vitamins and it's supposed to enhance them from 10 to 100 times as much uh i got to keep up with them three little boys and they wear me out i run from one end of my house to the other because one does something one place i go running over there the other two are tearing up something else and they do this all day long and there's no huh uh i probably would but then uh i wouldn't be at home i'd be out i'd be out working in the garden i got a big old garden see i'm a farmer at heart i got a nice big garden my onions and uh what do you call it garlic boy something garlic this high four inches high already onions onions and garlic both they're both about four inches high already i'm figuring i'll have onions in about about a month month and a half not bad and i got beans that are growing already they're about the same height some of them are not all of them then i got some small cucumbers they're only about this big they're just coming up huh oh yeah yeah i cook they tried to get me to be a cook in the army and i told them to kiss my butt i wouldn't cook for nobody they wanted me to after they caught me breaking into the mess hall cooking see i'm a tanker i was a tank gunner and that uh but uh at night i broke into the mess hall i used to do it once a month at least i'd break in make a big meal and then bake some pies and cakes then take it all up to the day room and all the guys in my company they'd all come running up there huh yeah i went uh huh they cut the hell out of my toenail uh there ain't much of it left i'll show you huh they want me to go back look at what happened he cut the nail here and all of it disappeared underneath well i told them what i was doing you know this is all that's left of that nail right there and uh i told them that i was soaking my feet with clr because i was getting tired of the fungus so i went to extremes and i soaked them in clr and that's probably stopping the fungus it killed it you know clr is a light acid it's a muriatic acid and well it really done the job on it because there's no toenail fungus on that toe no more what do i expect nothing not a thing huh they tell they tell me i have to come in i wouldn't come in unless i really huh oh no no i won't take that uh i don't know what can you do well i know no blood pressure medicine okay oh i take that i take a cholesterol i take red uh red yeast rice is what i take that's cholesterol medicine that's better than anything you got huh i know you wouldn't prescribe it i know that because you don't want nobody to get well i understand that you want to sell drugs that you got stock in the drug company; you want to sell them drugs to me well i don't want them alright lipitor there's a bad side of that um the one that i was taking i can't remember what the hell name of it was but it gives you bone fractures i will not take anything that's gonna fracture my hip cause i love to walk what oh don't worry about that i keep telling my kids that you don't worry about it you don't have to worry about it it's mine; let me worry about that part let go uh-huh right and it and if you listen to the patients as much as you talk to them you'd get a lot more done and you'd understand better i'm not like most people my insides are not like most people they don't act the same as most people i don't act i don't react to drugs the way most people do a lot of pain killers that they give me in the hospital do not work uh when they find one that does work they tell me oh no we can't give you that one no more now the only one that worked when i was in the hospital before was demerol nothing else they give me uh the codeine uh tylenol with codeine and everything that was like eating an m & m it done the same thing to me as an m & m yeah well that's what i'm talking about too the blood pressure the blood pressure i can't take the pills because the pills don't do what they're supposed to do they don't one of them actually brought my blood pressure up it come up as high as it is today without even having to go and drive on the expressway i got a ride here that day and my blood pressure was high uh my blood pressure goes up every time i hit that expressway yeah well it takes a while for it to get down after being on the expressway i can tell you that right now what was it i don't know but i didn't see what it was uh oh it's going down slowly i tell you it just takes time to go down because i mean if you were in the car with me coming here huh yeah one well i had a valve replaced it still hisses though right they took out the trace of the old one; they said it was replacing the old one though but they told me that uh they ain't gonna reopen it unless something else and it ain't nothing else yet so gotta leave it who oh yeah that's the head doctor yeah okay okay that's it okie dokey thank you alright oh there's one other thing that uh i could probably attribute to the blood pressure uh swellness yeah you know swelling my legs are swelled you see that usually i can see the bone here real sharp and on my feet i could see the veins and stuff when i'm not swelling up and the leg is a lot skinnier here but i know that i'm swelling i can feel it in my feet you know the feet feel swollen uh so i know i got swellness in my legs probably all the way up to the hip i don't know but um when i get that like this i sent to this company it's called travita they have a thing that they get from cactus plants called nopala i get four quarts of that and i drink 3 ounces a day every day until it's all gone and the swellness goes away a what that's what i like natural medications you don't have them in this hospital uh yeah i could do you have uh you don't have any huh cause i mean if you had one uh i'd call them and find out or get an appointment with him or something because uh i wish they had them here in the hospital you know there's one old doctor in here that i can't remember his name but uh he is the one that i uh checked on a lot of the drugs that they were giving me already and i told him what i was feeling from them and he said well they all have side effects and that and he told me about the uh the one for the cholesterol and i said well i definitely don't want a fractured hip so that one's out and i tell him i says when i get uh higher blood pressure from taking this one pill and he said that pill yeah okay and he told me about that one then i asked him about the plavix and he said well actually all plavix is like baby aspirin he says same thing as baby aspirin but it doesn't have aspirin in it no aspirin in it i said well that sounds good aspirin that's not aspirin well and he says yeah and i couldn't find everything i read didn't say nothing about plavix being bad so i kept taking that now i hear a report on it saying that it doesn't do nothing yeah that's what somebody wrote a report on so it got into the news and everything it was on the news and i asked that same doctor about it and he says well somebody's blowing smoke he said because he says well some people he says for some people it doesn't i don't know does plavix work the same for everybody or not uh but he said for some people it don't i said for me i think it works actually i think it keeps the platelets from sticking together because i don't have any more pain in my chest i used to get pain in my chest uh before when i didn't take the plavix so i keep it i been taking it ever since i had this done you know and until i can find something to take its place natural then i'll keep taking plavix but right now i haven't found anything so i'll keep looking in my books and different health food stores i'll find something that'll take the place of it yeah alright well you take it easy and i thank you very much alright you're a very nice doctor you listen most of them don't the dudes they don't want to listen they think they know everything the guys you know come fresh out of school they know everything they don't even the old doctors don't know everything when i went in because uh my daughters called and i didn't want to go they forced me to go in there i went in there this old doctor i don't know had to be in his 50s started telling me well you got to stop drinking and smoking i haven't smoked a cigarette since i was 25 years old i haven't gotten drunk since i was probably about 30 so i'm 70 now so because he was so serious about it in the hospital talking this shit i said to him i said okay doc i'll quit all of it i'll quit cold turkey right now cause i wasn't doing it in the first place that's all so i told him the truth i quit cold turkey i don't smoke i don't drink good huh when oh that old guy i can't remember i can't remember his name but uh he was here on the weekend he was the resident for the weekend i guess you know this was quite a while ago grey-haired guy yeah i know a lot of grey-haired doctors there's a lot of them too i mean there's some heavy ones but he was thin and everything else he was really nice and he was real informative and i told him all the stuff he says yeah well a lot of them are like that and blah blah blah blah i said what okay but if i do see him i'll have him get a hold of you all over here alright alright thank you take it easy you don't give me the stamp do you i don't get the stamp from you i get it from up front right okay dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1300323

<doctor> how may i help you ok alright are you feeling this pain on the lateral side of the elbow on the or on the medial side of the elbow ok and sorry when did this pain exactly start ok and has the pain been getting worse any better yeah ok was there any triggers or precipitating events to the pain such as like a fall or any types of trauma to the elbow have you had any pain or injury to the elbow in the past could you describe the character of the pain is it sharp achey or dull ok does the pain radiate anywhere ok just on the medial side of the left elbow ok and is there anything that you've done to help make the pain go away or any alleviating factors ok and uh are there any factors that make the pain worse ok so it's a movement ok and straightening the elbow ok i mean what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt ok and um so did you have any other symptoms associated with the elbow pain ok so have you had any fevers or chills have you had any night sweats or any any weight loss ok have you had any any headaches any sensory changes like changes to your vision or or hearing or even your smell or taste ok have you had any eye redness or eye discharge or your ear pain ok have you had a runny nose or sore throat have you had a cough or shortness of breath have you had any wheezing ok have you had any chest pain any lightheadedness or dizziness have you had any heart palpitations ok and have you had any nausea or vomiting have you had any abdominal pain any diarrhea or constipation have you had any urinary problems ok have you had any skin rashes ok have you had any numbness or tingling and how about any muscle weakness ok and any joint pains anywhere else ok and any changes to your memory or or any confusion ok and have you had any fatigue ok and have you had any changes to your appetite ok are an have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok so do you take any medications either prescribed or over the counter ok and do you have any allergies to medications ok and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries ok so it's the to the fracture was on the other arm ok and did that heal ok alright then can you tell me about your living situation currently like whereabouts and who you're living with ok and are you working currently and what do you do ok yeah do you notice this uh pain after more so after a shift or after after a long day ok and what types of hobbies do you have like do you play golf or tennis or or any kind of like sports i guess ok um ok and um do you smoke cigarettes and do you drink alcohol ok and how about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or or anything else ok alright and is there any family history of any heart or lung problems any musculoskeletal or neurological diseases ok i got any autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease or diabetes ok um and so next i wanted to walk through a physical exam so when you look at the elbow yourself do you see any swelling or redness ok does it look like there is any muscle atrophy either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps ok and how about any misalignment or joint deformity ok and are there any scars ok and when you press on the medial part of the the elbow do you feel pain how about over the olecranon or the yea any pain over the olecranon ok and is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow ok an any pain over the forearm or biceps or triceps muscles ok and does the joint feel like it's hot ok and any pain with shoulder or elbow movements ok ok when are you straightening it out all the way ok but no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion ok and how about pain with pronation and supination ok at the medial side ok and how about with wrist so with resisted uh yeah wrist flexion ok and then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go ok and is there any numbness or tingling anywhere ok ok so that was everything that i wanted to ask about today was there anything else that you wanted to mention yeah so it it's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers such as like passive wrist extension resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area and so this is typically treated with activity modification so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain and using medications such as advil and tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well and also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury um or yeah or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there are you allergic to anything oh okay anything else any medication alright i feel a little weird @@@ yeah let me see if i can move some chairs though give me a sec @@@ right from here are we gonna fit okay no you can sit here don’t worry we'll turn it this way you can have a seat here close the door and that way we can uh how are you doing today well that's excellent you are one of the first person today who say he's superb you win the superb award alright so we haven't seen you in this clinic for a while cause you have been in and out of the hospital @@@ more times than i can tell alright so since the last time you saw us about a year ago a few things have happened right you've had surgery up here you got surgery on your foot you had that cardiac catheterization done you were seen at hines you're like uh we'll just manage you with your medicines right is that what they decided okay and then recently you were just hospitalized because you were having nausea and vomiting so @@@ yep yep that's a lot that's enough for you you don't get any more for the rest of the year um how are you how's the nausea and the vomiting okay um those pills they sent you home with that reglan and metoclopramide it's that one you take before you eat is that helping so it is cause it's not coming back right we just keep going with it okay we don't want to mess up a good thing alright okay and then that other stomach acid medicine the ranitidine has that been helping you yeah okay the other one is uh twice a day okay okay okay so tell me what you're taking for your diabetes uh-huh okay and do you check your sugars okay so um i would like for you to check your sugars more regularly anytime anybody's on insulin we got to just check them a little bit more frequently okay um when you do check them what do you think they run okay any lows have you felt low okay and you felt it then huh okay okay the 140s to 150s low 70s alrighty okay now the last number we had on you do you know what an a1c is okay so instead of so what an a1c is this new measure that we have for the last couple of years uh to check on patients with diabetes it's a test that we check in your blood and they checked it in your blood when you were in the hospital and it gives you kind of like an average reading over the three months when you just prick your finger it's just really what you just age what time of day it is what medicines you're on but this one gives us an average for over three months okay and for every diabetic their goal is less than 7 okay for you yours was 7.3 so close but not close yeah yeah so um i think since they put you on that regimen of insulin we have to just wait a couple of months right to see if it's really taking effect which is fine you know which is okay so we'll just have you check in a couple of months and see how that's going now um issue number two is you had a history of high blood pressure right yes okay @@@ um and right now we have you on metoprolol 75 mg a day right um the lisinopril 10 mg a day okay and you're taking all those you don't miss a dose okay good you're close enough to where i wouldn't change anything about it you're 134 133 so that's good enough for me um do you check your blood pressure at home do you have a blood pressure cuff you didn't do it yourself cause we're checking it for you oh good what has it been running when she does it so that kind ranges in the low one okay okay we're okay now so i don't want to do too much so that's okay and then last week we started you on a medicine for your cholesterol right the simvastatin okay good so let's keep going with that you're not having any muscle pain okay sure we’ll refill it all and then are you taking a baby aspirin a baby aspirin okay um so a couple people we got to get you hooked up with okay um one is our cardiologist okay not the vascular people but the uh-huh if you need to see the vascular clinic yes yes you do and we can get you in to see them too okay and when was the last time you checked your eyes to see if the diabetes has it been a while okay fine we can get you in to see them uh-huh uh-huh oh oh no we can see if there's something else we can do um and then just a second next is your colonoscopy do you remember having one of those done in the past and when was the last one do you think okay yeah i think we said in our last note that you had it done about eight years ago about a year ago so about nine years ago and then we tried to bring up some records from mercy okay well is a colonoscopy something you want well we recommend it for anybody between the age of 50 and 75 we recommend you get a colonoscopy and if it's been that long it would probably be about time again is that okay okay alrighty okay well anything that's bothering you today uh-huh uh-huh oh uh so i think we're gonna have you go through our social worker for that i'll be honest with you i don't know what @@@ we'll go along with that but when you go up front to the desk to check out just ask them where you can go to ask somebody about the veterans benefits and they'll point you in the right direction okay alright let's take a listen to you okay big deep breaths again again and again and again good go ahead and lie back okay good let me check one other thing how are your kidneys doing let's see okay not bad not bad alrighty so you said you want me to fill everything okay good let me talk it over with my boss and i'll be right back okay okay hi there how are you nice to meet you guys my you've been through a lot lately huh but you're looking great though you don't seem any worse for the wear i would say looks like you're doing everything right um okay well good so how are you feeling so i wanted you to if you saw me you could recognize that uh i'm one of the attendings here but uh she's got a plan all set for you now are you getting therapy at all at home or okay for the therapy @@@ okay perfect @@@ get better so they don't want you to bear any weight yet okay that's fine um we just wanted to make sure that that was being looked at but but sounds like they're on top of it so we'll just do some fine tuning and you'll be you know before long you'll be getting back to the point where you're able to yeah do therapy and bear weight on that leg get up and around well good luck to you and i'll be seeing i'm sure i'll see you soon okay take care alright okay sure so a couple of changes we're gonna make so for the diabetes uh we think that you're actually overall doing pretty good i think we could just fine tune it just a little bit so instead of taking the 10 units if you want to bump it up just a little bit to the 12 okay and we'll see how it is you can check your sugars i want you to start checking your sugars more regularly at home okay so if you want to check it up you know mostly like five times out of the week you check it before in the mornings or something you know before you eat anything and then a couple of times a week check it uh about an hour or so or two hours after you eat okay so that we can see both what those are and in three months when you come back to see me i want you to tell me how your sugars have been doing okay now if you find that you're going to low cut back you know try 11 units if that's not helping then go back to 10 okay i know i know but its but for you it might be a bigger difference because you're not that heavy you know so that makes a little bit more of a fine tuning okay and we'll get you back in to see our eye doctor let's see when the last time we had you see them last um well i'm glad you think that was fun i don't know about that but yeah we'll get you back in to see them and we'll get you back to see the eye clinic so let's do that we're going to increase that to 12 okay and that's it for the diabetes okay so next is for your heart and your blood pressure so with your heart condition that we were talking about your blood pressure could be just a little bit lower and it would be better okay not too crazy but just a little lower so we wanted to you know that lisinopril that you're on so you're taking like half a tablet right we want you to go ahead and take a full tablet of it okay so it'll be one tablet yes a full one yeah that one you leave just as it you leave that one just as is okay so we'll increase that one to 20 and then next is we want to get you in to see our cardiologist okay so let me see about that we'll put in a new so one is just for the heart and one is for everything else okay so we'll get you in to see both of them okay let me just make this order for it okay so you have one for vascular they're gonna send you a letter in the mail like for this month or so and we'll get you in to see our heart doctors too oh no no no we can put it in here let's just see vascular clinic and we'll say two weeks okay let's do that okay it's up to them i don't know what they have let me put one to two weeks okay and the cardiologist you'll see and then the colonoscopy we'll do next time okay so i want you to see all these people first okay so that's it so you come and see me in three months up front they'll make you a clinic appointment to vascular surgery and for the heart doctors okay um and then they'll also make you a clinic for the eye appointment as well okay um and then you come and see me in three months and at that time we'll check your sugars again and the blood the a1c that i was talking about and we'll take it from there sound okay let me go through and refill all the rest of your medicines okay okay you're all set so go ahead and give this to them up front so i'll give this to you alright i'll help you get you out of here just open the door first and bring him in and i maybe back you out huh yeah i'll open the door alright let me open this take care </doctor> <patient> hi yes i've had this pain in my left elbow

before ok in what way is this different ok and then you said it start started a couple days ago is that correct ok and since you noticed it has it gotten worse over those three days ok and how frequently are you coughing and what does that what does that sputum look like ok ok um and is there anything that you've changed recently in your life or any kind of things that have provoked your cough that you know of ok and is there anything that makes uh makes it worse say any position or anything that you do in your day to day routine you find makes you cough more ok and have you taken any any medicine or anything to try to help with us ok ok did you find that they helped at all and what kind of pain is it that you're experiencing ok ok um the right side of your chest and belly area yeah ok so is that pain is it did it start around the same time as the cough ok and is this a pain that you've ever had before ok is the pain primarily there when you cough or is it present at all times ok and and um you said that it's a sharp pain ok ok and is it any worse when you're doing activity like when you're up and walking around ok ok um an since uh since this coughing and this this right sided pain that you're talking about began have you noticed any fevers ok ok well i'm glad that i'm really glad that you came in because yeah we really want to get this looked into have you been around anyone that's been sick recently ok and have you traveled anywhere recently ok um ok and can you just give me an idea of any do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor

that you have had a cough for a really long time a dryer cough then you're having sputum now but is that something you've seen the doctor for ok so just to make sure i have your list of medications

drink alcohol do you use any other substance ok and do you have any family history of respiratory or heart problems ok um and do you have any allergies ok ok well thank you for sharing all of that

everything going oh my okay hmm well the gout medicine they only gave you nine pills they barely gave you any of the medicine when they gave it to you for the gout they only gave you a few pills of the gout medicine when they did give it to you right they didn't give you enough to last a month okay hmm how about your insulin did you need it okay and are you taking the vitamin d that big pill once a week you finished taking it okay alright how's everything else going you're urinating okay are you having any gout attacks anywhere you have recently which joints do you have it in in your feet yeah is it bad right now okay for your gout okay how often do you have to take that gout medicine well i mean like in an average month like last month how many times did you have to take it okay okay okay do you get any low sugars with this ever do you get any low sugars does your sugar get low sure and how much insulin do you use right now okay yeah this is looking good i think these are great so as long as your sugar is not getting too low we won't need to change anything then okay okay and you don't smoke right yeah i was just gonna ask you that do you know when your last tetanus shot was okay was it you think in the last ten years it was in the last ten years so you're saying you take the gout pills twice a month and you just take one pill twice a month then what okay and that takes care of it when you have a gout attack uh-huh okay and have you ever been on a medicine that you take every day to help prevent gout attacks um because there's a medicine called allopurinol that you can take one pill every day and it's supposed to help decrease the amount of uric acid in your body and uric acid is what causes gout attacks would you like to start that pill to take to help prevent the gout attacks it’s one pill once a day and it helps your kidneys get rid of some of that extra uric acid in the body and that uric acid is what gets in your joints and can cause the gout flares but it is one more pill you'd have to take every day it's not just the pill that you take when you have the gout attack it something you take every single day okay and you want to pick it up today alright and the magnesium also okay are those the only ones you're gonna pick up today okay so let me do that first okay so those medicines will be at the pharmacy today and let me go through all your other medicines and make sure you have enough refills left so you can call for it okay okay so it'll be at the pharmacy and you don't need the shot you don't need a tetanus shot because you had one in 2003 okay so you got the tetanus shot just eight years ago and you don't need a booster so you're gonna continue all your medicines and start this new one it's called allopurinol just one pill once a day okay and then we're gonna have you come back and see the pharmacist in a couple of months they’ll mail you @@@ alright take care </doctor> <patient> yeah so uh a couple of days ago i just started to not feel so well and i've been having this cough and trouble breathing i do have a uh cough regularly but i mean i i think that's related to maybe smoking it's something that was going on for a few years this coughs a little bit different it's been happening more often throughout the day and and bringing up more more mucus it seems like yeah i think like monday so uh yeah i guess like 3 days ago then yeah i would say uh today's the worst day i've continually felt um sick uh i would say maybe a couple of times per hour i'm i'm filling up a some tissues with sputum it's like a dark greenish yellow colour ugh no i can't think of anything i've been kind of sticking to my regular routines um and not really i can't i can't think of anything um no i i've i i do have a little bit of pain so i was i did take some tylenol and some advil over the last few days but that's about it a little bit yeah but it would just kind of take the edge off of the pain for a little bit and it came back um it's kind of a a sharp pain over on the like the right side of my chest like maybe belly area yeah i think it it might have started a little bit after no i haven't had anything like this happen before i would say more so when i cough or if i'm like taking a big breath um yeah kind of after after i have a coughing episode i take a deep breath and i really will feel the pain then yeah yeah more of a sharp pain no don't notice it with any any activity i think yeah i've been hot the last few days and i i checked my temperature earlier today and it was like 38.6 so that was one of the reasons why i wanted to come in actually no but i i do some volunteer work at one of the homeless shelters at a few times a week so i am around a lot of people no i've been at home and and doing the volunteer work

<doctor> good afternoon ma'am have you ever had surgery ma'am do you remember how old you were when you had surgery date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ hi how are you today this way have a seat i haven't seen you it's been a long time oh @@@ a lot of times we don't have a lot of openings we only have the clinic twice a month so not very many yeah i saw that how you doing yeah how many times have you been to the emergency room okay two times in the last five months maybe for exacerbations you've gotten worse okay yeah i forgot what you said um grinder united standard industry grinder exposed to a lot of dust yeah and uh yeah let me look it looks like you went to the er in june and march and in june they did prednisone they gave you antibiotics @@@ how do you think that went did that help okay and how do you feel right now the albuterol inhalers any coughs how bad is it improved with the inhaler and in general how's your exercise tolerance can you walk without getting short of breath about how far can you walk so you can walk pretty good you don't feel limited by your breathing okay and you're taking the combivent the albuterol and the formoterol oh @@@ refills do you need some i’ll just refill that i want to make sure you have enough so that you don't have to keep calling you now to get hold of me @@@ you already had the formoterol they gave you a six months @@@ and i just gave you refills for the other ones anything else going on any chest pains fevers or chills i hear you it's hot out is it a hot day i haven’t been outside @@@ not since this morning any trouble with weight loss or weight gain so how's your appetite but at night you eat a real meal still smoking um what do you want to do to quit how else can i help you would you want to see the smoking cessation clinic here maybe they have i mean i can offer you patches and @@@ drugs but they may have some different method of um smoking cessation like using behavioral modification or okay how much are you smoking okay it's hard i mean i've never smoked so i don't really know a lot about it but from what i hear it's hard to @@@ yeah but it would improve your lung function you know your lung function will continue to deteriorate at a rapid rate if you keep smoking if you stop smoking it kind of goes back to the normal deteriorating rate you know if you hadn't smoked so let me look nothing is in my mailbox right now when did you bring it in long time ago okay and then you saw me oh between me and the yeah the resident let me look for that well we were going to repeat the pfts but i don't think that's been done yet the order is in oh it’s active let me see if i can find it oh you didn't show up maybe you didn't know when they set you up for an appointment on 03/11 at 2 o'clock but it says you didn't show up here why don’t we redo the order we need to check your lung function well it doesn't take very long @@@ 15 minutes yeah want to hold off for now if your symptoms start to change then we'll make more of an effort to let me check your vitals blood pressure is a little high; i just want to recheck it looks like we checked some labs back in february blood work.it looks like your blood counts look good your kidney function is good your cholesterol looks good we want this number under 200 and @@@ under 160 and its 100 and this is your good cholesterol the hdl and yours is great that's like the best good cholesterol i've ever seen well that's another thing we probably need to talk about um how much are you drinking so last time you told me eight so that must be getting better okay well maybe chest x-ray @@@ @@@ why did we do the cat scan again oh the weight loss huh right but they didn't see anything well they saw like some degenerative joint disease in the spine which happens as people get older you get a little bit of arthritis just like you would get in you know your knees and spine so if that becomes a problem you have to let me know okay i think it was about here where they saw it @@@ and the treatment for that would be taking something like tylenol or ibuprofen or naproxen or something like that uh okay i'd forgotten about that so it looked okay good the pfts we'll need to do it later okay okay what else were we going to do oh did you see mental health do you feel depressed at all okay so normal no feelings of hurting yourself @@@ i'm going to check a couple other things here while you're here they checked your prostate gland it looks fine they checked your thyroid and it looks good the cholesterol we talked about they checked your vitamin levels sometimes when you drink beer you don't get the right vitamins that all looked good so far so good yeah you just quit smoking though really we talked about that so uh now a colonoscopy what do you think about that so you're still thinking about it okay um everything else looks good well let me take a listen to you you don't drive after you drink or anything like that no you don't need it and neither does anyone else on the street oh my goodness oh my god is this recent oh man well he's your brother he was trouble @@@ @@@ when people @@@ react @@@ can you see @@@ okay that's really weird i didn't notice that last time we always worry about people if they aren’t symmetrical @@@ their brain it's a big problem but if you've had it for a long time so you know not to scare you i am sure it is fine take a deep breath again breathe normally let's repeat your blood pressure all my patients in the hospital right have to have blood pressures i've been repeating them all day getting really good at it huh oh my god at home i had someone come into the clinic with a blood pressure like that @@@ it's 120/90 yeah it could be the stress of parking and getting in here okay i got to make sure we don’t need to treat you otherwise you feel pretty good your lungs sound good okay and no blood in the stool or anything so think about the colonoscopy i mean i can't force you but it's always a good idea to look yeah well early detection is nice because they pull the polyp out and it's gone so so yeah well for you you mean it's kind of dependent on symptoms uh for her once you hit below like 90 the top number 90 then you kind of have to start to worry that maybe the blood pressure medicine is too much and especially if she feels lightheaded when she stands up or feels like she's going to pass out you know that kind of feeling then you have to worry if the blood pressure medicine is too much so and sometimes too if you if you want just kind of like that's what we do here in the hospital but if you take her blood pressure lying down and then have her stand up and stand for like two minutes and then take her blood pressure standing up those numbers should be almost the same if the blood pressure standing up is a lot lower like 20 points lower then she's probably on too much medicine okay so you could try that and at least you’ll know so i'll be right back okay five minutes i'm the only one here so real quick okay you're good nothing new when do you think you should come back do you want to try and do six months okay if something happens obviously come back sooner or i mean do you think you can handle waiting to see me or something just try and make an appointment sooner if you need to come to the er come to the er okay yeah well if you run out call and i'll refill them okay that's the easiest okay yeah do renew but if they tell you you have no refills then you have to call and they will contact me to renew it so you should have enough for six months then okay alright there you go nice job alright good to see you enjoy the summer stay cool </doctor> <patient> good afternoon doctor actually yes i have i had pinning surgery done on both of my ears um i was five or six years old it was when i was a kid i know that for sure yes there you are @@@ good doctor yes hi yeah a long time geez i'm getting tired of waiting yeah yeah and i'm coming

<doctor> alright so this is going to be a complex case your wound is complicated by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cellulitis there is it will be more aggressive but we can do it </doctor> <patient> is there a treatment for my right leg </patient>,True,1,True,1,True,True
<doctor> what brings you in oh yeah for sure um when did this start okay okay and did anything happen to trigger this did she fall on that arm or like injuries okay alright um and in terms of the type of pain she's having right now did she say if it was a dull achy kind of pain or is it sharp okay and has it been constant since she um started experiencing this or does it come and go okay um and then is the pain just in the elbow or does it radiate down into her hands or up to her shoulders okay have you tried anything for this pain yeah 1 to 10 10 being the worst type of pain how bad is this pain for her okay and then um has she ever experienced pain like this in the past okay um and then does she have any numbness or tingling in the area okay how about memory loss or confusion um any headaches um dizziness or fainting spells any weight loss recently fevers or chills uh rashes uh changes in vision hearing smell or taste uh any coughing shortness of breath or wheezing uh any chest pain or heart palpitations uh any changes in bowel movements um how about changes in urine okay and is she otherwise healthy does she have any longstanding medical conditions okay and um with her mother's pregnancy with her were there any complications at that point okay and no issues as a neonate okay that's good um and then she hasn't had any hospitalizations or surgery since then alright his she on any medications okay um is she up-to-date with her immunizations okay how about allergies does she have any okay any uh family history of musculoskeletal issues uh lung or heart conditions um autoimmune conditions cancers um is she like on par with her peers in terms of developments and reaching milestones okay and who does she live with at home okay um and does anyone at home smoke any concerns for her safety at home no okay and how are things at school for her okay that's good has she come in contact with anyone sick recently have you done any travel recently okay alright and those are all the questions i had for history taking let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview um i'm just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms do you see any um redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left okay how about um any muscle atrophy deformities or skin changes like bruises okay how about um when you palpate her elbows does is she in pain okay how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles okay how about her biceps and triceps no okay um alright and those are all the questions that i kind of had for you did you have any questions of your own for myself okay yeah it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you're giving me it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation um and that's usually caused in young children when they're like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight um which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit um so um in terms of like a management plan you can try conservative things like ice packs um over the counter painkillers um otherwise we can try to um put the radius back into its normal position here which will just take uh like a few minutes um and and then after we reduce it back into its place um she should have normal function of her arm again um if she's still experiencing pain we can continue keeping it on a splint um but otherwise i don't think we need any imaging for this at this um at this time so did you have any questions or any concerns about that okay great um thank you i hear someone has a birthday coming up how old are you turning ma'am you're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit what seems to be the problem today great i saw your blood pressure reading for today and it's much better are you taking the higher dose of mavik we recommended how did you tolerate the higher dose that was one m g per day correct that does happen here try this sample of tarka please well since you're taking the mavik plus verapamil you can switch over to tarka which is the combined version of the two drugs good so back to that right arm how is that doing today did you have x rays taken today good i have the images right here well these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury well look right here the humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder but do you have any pain here then we won't worry about it how has this pain developed and progressed recently what medicines are you taking right now then do you think this could be acid reflux or heartburn i see how long have you worn dentures do they come and go the sores okay we'll keep an eye on it it's hard to tell if you have a tremor today ma'am but do you think the lexapro is helping otherwise date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ how you doing today okay good are you just here for kind of like a regular check-up or yeah they told you to come in uh-huh you were in the er for back pain huh it's mostly your left knee that bothers you did you give rheumatology a call or no did you see the rheumatology clinic uh-huh okay uh-huh that's like when @@@ and you definitely look somewhere yeah yeah she’s taller no no she's uh; i'm just covering for her no she'll be back so you need

300 400 what's this they’re not good at all so they are kind of all over the place @@@ do ever like check your blood at least after two hours after eating hmm but is it always at least after two hours after eating cause if you eat dinner no but it's i mean it's not like you eat at 9 and then you check it at 10 you don't do that right it has to be at least two hours after eating well when do you check it then i know but at night when you check it uh-huh yes okay so it's before you eat dinner okay well do you have your meter with you today because you know it might not be working properly uh-huh oh no they were bad they weren't working oh you need to bring it in so we can make sure that it's actually working right um your diabetes is definitely not well controlled okay and it needs to be controlled a lot better it's not a matter of checking it three times it's a matter of making sure your monitor is working right and then it's a matter of uh you know maybe adjusting your medication or increase it and i think we probably do at this point you're on 22 right okay are you taking but you're not taking anything else for diabetes right uh-huh and when was that what and what did you take uh-huh yeah hmm so it looks like in january they had increased to 26 units @@@ okay and you finished five days of steroids right for your knee yes it was you were taking it at the beginning of january and they gave you five days of steroids and it helped with the pain okay okay ho’s your eating going uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i’m sorry @@@ milk okay okay ensure okay okay uh-huh for diabetics okay oh you're wondering why they can't prescribe it to you yeah i mean wait it's not a medication it's just a supplement unfortunately it's not a medication for everybody so it's not something that we can prescribe @@@ yeah i don't know yeah you want to make sure uh-huh uh-huh in your meds you know i don’t see it on there do you see a special nutritionist or something it’s not on your med list

know you don't ask for it but something you know slowly starts to fall apart sometimes well you are diabetic you are diabetic okay and diabetes it affects your heart your kidneys um it affects your eyes those are the main ones it affects okay the best way to try to not have you know all these affects is to try to control your sugars okay so that's extremely important for you at this age um your blood pressure we'll check it but yeah i want to see the top number below 130 you're a diabetic okay it can't be 144; it has to be below 130 yeah well if you bring in your machine we can change it out

yeah and you'll see like if i like i have no swelling right but for you if i like go like this it'll leave the imprint of my finger and i'll see it hang out there yeah yeah so it's always on the inner side so like on this side or this side that's where you'll really see it and you have a good deal of swelling in there today oh yeah that's good that's good we'll have you let's see you saw a podiatrist actually recently so that's good yeah and have you seen ophthalmology yeah i know but i guess the main thing for you is to control the diabetes now the gout how is your knee doing is it

that was there a certain medication you needed a refill on so which ones do you know because you should really have refills on most of these i'll go through them with you so all the medications they're listed here and then you see how many refills there are oh so these are the medications you're on right like metoprolol @@@ for your blood pressure you’re on codeine okay okay this metoprolol you still have three refills this is your blood pressure medication yeah probably yeah take one half tablet by mouth twice a day uh-huh yeah that's the one yeah but do you have these medications okay

it but uh @@@ tell them to return to the clinic with the pharmacist in three to four weeks that's with the pharmacist and at that point bring your sugar log book okay so we want to see how you're doing with the increased level of insulin um and bring your glucometer so they can test it and make sure it's working sure and then you'll see us back in three months okay why oh you should bring it

she's been having this pain just in her elbow um and like today we've noticed right after she woke up she's been in pain and also just keeping her elbow like protected um kind of like just flexing it and just holding on to it so i think it's uh giving her a lot of discomfort and she's been crying as well i think it started uh after we went for a walk last uh evening um and we just went to the park and since then like she's been having that pain um i think like just uh she was playing and then um she was about to fall like right like right on to the playground pavement so i remember like but like i caught her right away so to protect her and then since then i don't know if like there was like a jerk movement as like i kind of pulled her back up or um when i was stopping her from falling like if that caused it but she didn't hit herself or anything like that she says it's aching a lot it's it's been pretty constant since then and yeah she just kind of keep keeping she's kind of keep just keeping it like her arms extended um and then yeah just holding on to it um it kind of goes into her upper arm like from her elbows to her upper upper arm uh no i haven't tried any medications or anything i just wanted to come in before i tried anything i would say it's probably at least a 7 um no this is the first time um no not that i know of no nope no no nope uh no no um no no uh no um no

<doctor> how may i help you i see alright so when does the shortness of breath happen it do you have it at rest or is it on exertion ok how far are you able to walk before you get shorter breath or how many flights of stairs are you able to do ok and when did you notice that the change ok so a bit so it's been going on for a bit of time now ok um do you are you able to lie down flat without experiencing shorter breath ok um so so it sounds like no orthop is what they call it and have you had any episodes where you wake up in the middle of the night and you're short of breath and you need to sit up an end to catch it ok and have you had any leg swelling ok any you mentioned that you've had a cough as well how long have you experienced a cough for ok are you coughing up any sputum or any phlegm are you coughing up any blood ok and have you had any um wheezing ok how how about any chest pain ok so does that like how would you describe it is it like sharp achy uh dull or pressure like ok um it does it go away after you're done coughing i see ok and have you experienced any um any headaches ok how about any um like eye redness or eye discharge any ear pain or your discharge how about any changes to vision or hearing ok have you had a runny nose or sore throat ok how about um any changes to or have you had any loss of smell or any loss of taste ok and have you had a loss of appetite ok and have you had any unexpected weight loss over the last several months ok and have you been trying to lose weight ok um have you had any fevers have you had any chills have you had any night sweats ok um and have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart's racing have you had any fainting or lightheadedness or dizziness ok um have you had any abdominal pain have you had any nausea or vomiting have you had any diarrhea or constipation and have you had any skin rashes have you had any muscle aches or joint pains and have you had any ah confusion or memory loss ok ok and how is your energy been uh recently have you had any fatigue or malaise ok alright so it sounds like this this dry cough and then and shortness of breath it is mostly what you been um experiencing and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions ok um and do you use uh any medications or any inhalers ok did you do i i pulmonary function tests where you're breathing into a tube alright yeah and uhm do you have any allergies um and have you had any hospitalizations or any previous surgeries ok and could you tell me a little bit about your living situation like where you're living and who you're living with ok and has your husband been sick or anybody you've been around been sick ok and are you currently working ok and any concerns for like exposures while you're at work in terms like breathing in any dusts or any fumes i see is there a chance that there could have been asbestos at any of those places that you worked yeah i see this was like 10 years ago 20 years ago or or longer ok and do you smoke cigarettes oh congratulations it's not easy to quit uh and do you drink alcohol ok and do you use recreational drugs ok um and uh are there any heart or lung conditions that run in the family ok are there any cancers that are in the family like anybody who's had lung cancer ok and um have you traveled anywhere recently ok and are you currently sexually active ok um and can you tell me about your partner or partners is it's at your husband or um anyone else ok and any concerns for ah sexually transmitted infection ok and i think that was everything that i wanted to ask on history today um was there anything else that you wanted to add that i maybe forgot about well yeah so at this time it will be important to get some lung imaging and and possibly some other investigations as well because of your exposure uh to inhalants and fumes and possibly asbestos so i’m concerned there could be possibly an asbestos related lung illness that that you have um and so it will be important to investigate for yeah possibly a asbestos related lung cancer yeah it looks like you have an extensive medical history i'm sorry that your heart has been giving you so much trouble i'm happy that you're here with us today and taking the right measures to keep yourself healthy when did you have the biopsies done did they come back negative i understand date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ how are you @@@ @@@ uh once a year i'll find something @@@ send you here um pulmonary function tests and the reports were normal yeah exactly uh how you doing overall still have that cough huh uh-huh yeah and you had a stress test recently you had a tsh that was normal uh cause your stress test is pretty much to see if you're having – what would be causing the palpitations or its just decreased blood flow to your heart serious heart problems yeah yeah you got that last year yeah um we ended up getting a tsh cause we concerned about the thyroid hormone and that your thyroid hormone was elevated @@@ through that that was normal uh we checked your cholesterol once again this also goes along the lines if you don’t have blood flow to your heart cholesterol is high then it could be what causes palpitations but that was normal so um the reason i ordered the pulmonary function tests one of the most common causes of a chronic cough is asthma and you don't have asthma uh so there are other common cause of chronic cough actually there are two other causes one is reflux reflux can actually cause a cough it can cause a cough @@@ asthma @@@ so um do you have reflux after you eat yeah sure @@@ yeah do you know what pill it was uh @@@ well i mean right like you said profiles oftentimes unless they are like black-box warnings oftentimes for example i can say nausea and vomiting you'll see nausea and vomiting or gi upset for almost every single medication but it doesn't mean that everyone has it uh they can actually improve your @@@ so there’s multiple random-controlled trials of uh and well-documented uh trials showing that these medicine can help with the cough uh-huh yeah well @@@ if it didn't suppress your coughing then it didn’t do good yeah no no right no it's very simple did the medication help did your coughing stop after you started taking the medication okay so it didn't help i'm sorry what repeat what you just said i'm sorry what are you taking yeah well i mean actually you know those medications can result in uh you're talking about altering the ph of your stomach um which yeah you can do that but uh often times we recommend against that and the reason why is because the bacteria the reason why your @@@ low ph for one reason @@@ protective mechanism uh but that uh @@@ kills the bacteria yeah yeah so uh it keeps the ph at a very low level to slow bacteria up here so if you're @@@ high reflux you know you can aspirate some of the reflux um it won't be filled with bacteria you know what i'm saying um so i wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that uh what we can of do though i mean uh how long have you been on it are you still taking the omeprazole are you still taking that 30 three refills @@@ on and you say you took it only for 30 days or did you take it for less than that what was in the bottle and it didn't help you at all okay alright uh usually three month trials okay alright yeah well i mean it could just be the fact that you need a higher dose you know yeah well @@@ well sometimes it's very difficult to find out what's causing it and i wouldn't expect and @@@ is suppressing the cough you're not suppressing the cause what you're doing is you're ending up treating the cause and that is the way you go about finding out how what the cause is if you end up taking the omeprazole and it actually works then that is the cause you understand uh well if you want to problem to go away very common do you drink coffee in the morning well first of all right now we don't even know whether it's reflux or not so i mean so i mean i think it sounds like reflux to me but if you're not willing to take the omeprazole then we'll see what else i mean that's not something that we need to do the other thing is @@@ it seems like the serious causes are out of it uh-huh yeah well sometimes you can't you can't yeah right right sure yeah okay so it didn't help at all then that's surprising uh like i said i would admit that doesn't fit in the picture it didn't help at all that surprises me yeah yeah and then the other thing that we can possibly do is we could once again is trial but what we'd do is we'd give you a trial of medication and we'll see if it works if it works then that's the cause that's the way that it works exactly it doesn't cure the problem well unfortunately we don't have a lot that we can cure problems with @@@ okay okay how's everything else going for you other than the cough yeah we can give you some well i totally understand when you get we can give you something called a holter monitor have you ever had one of those yeah so it monitors the beat of the heart but it monitors it for 24 hours and when you're telling me is you have heart palpitations almost every day when you cough right whenever you cough week or two i have it documented for like the last time you were here that you had heart palpitations yeah and that was back in let's see it was back in uh let's see back in november yeah and last month and then yeah and i have it again back in august of 2009 and then i have it back in yeah so i mean yeah actually you had it back in 2008 that you'd been having heart palpitations yeah um okay well we can go ahead and give you a holter monitor and uh see how you do no it just monitors your heart um i don't think so not that i know of um anxiety that could cause it i mean yeah definitely that could cause it uh-huh pretty stressed out yeah you know yeah that's good yeah i know it does yeah um when do the palpitations occurs other than the coughing do they ever occur without the coughing i mean if you if you cough a lot if you end up coughing a lot and your heart your hearts’ just going faster in response to it yeah it very well could be that but you know we have to make sure that it's not necessarily a serious kind of palpitations like i mean first of all it could be severe serious causes and non-serious causes causing the palpitations okay uh serious causes result in your heart stopping beating so um and non-serious causes are i mean i'm sure that @@@ but at least you have the comfort of having a non-serious causes @@@ you know your heart beats irregularly for a couple of beats and then it comes back to normal so we can get if you get the holter monitor we can watch it for 24 hours and i mean you can just be walking around you know doing your everyday things and it will be analyzed and uh we'll go from there okay no it'll monitor but the palpitations the cause of it is the heart so i mean it could be the heart it could be just your anxiety but we'll at least be able to find out whether it’s the heart or not yeah that always helps exercise is excellent where you lift yeah i was going to say i lift but i don't @@@ run as much as i should yeah that is pretty cool @@@ sure sure yeah monitor that try that yeah that's a real good idea uh yeah alright let's @@@ really for what yeah so what we see an ekg is just a snap shot it's like what's occurring as body @@@ it's like a picture right now this the holter monitor is a video recording so it watching i mean you just go through your activities every day you know and so it kind of sees your every day life and it sees how your heart reacts to it so you know like i mean if you're not having palpitations at that minute and they did the ekg then it doesn't mean anything right yeah yeah yeah and it usually happens during the day sometimes the holter monitor during those 24 hours might not have any palpitations at all so you know it @@@ much use but if you're having palpitations you actually have heart palpitations then you know let's just they can still take a look at it and we'll see what happens so when you actually get the holter monitor remember whether you had palpitations that day okay okay check your other labs real quick yeah @@@ oh now what was it is it the hydrocortisone what was it when was the last time you saw dermatology do you remember here we go you're on retin a cream yeah no problem @@@ is there anything else you need @@@ how long do they last when it comes on and do you get any chest pain or just palpitations any shortness of breath i mean you can take a deep breath right @@@ occasionally oh okay yeah how many push-ups do you do okay so about an hour okay i think you're heart's in good shape though alright i'll be right back is this a cough that you have it’s the cough okay now i'm just perusing those notes on what is causing the cough so your breathing has been fine no sign of asthma um @@@ exacerbate @@@ making @@@ right do you feel like you have a stuffy nose blowing your nose or a tickle in the back of your throat okay you don't have any so @@@ sinus x-ray cause you've had some sinusitis in the past that's another common cause for um @@@ yeah okay @@@ some symptoms from that @@@ smoking you don't smoke and do you get it in the morning when you wake up when you start eating actually start coughing yeah okay okay uh-huh @@@ so you have coffee chocolate @@@ and uh okay any cokes or anything like that caffeine would be thing we're looking for no sodas throughout the day oh um um so that could be something we could do and @@@ why @@@ know why okay and then i will be right back oh okay so @@@ is normal uh i believe so @@@ you could send him to the see the ent doctor for @@@ for a day or two and um they also could see @@@ uh reflux affecting your vocal cords or something @@@ um you know we could do @@@ or we could just order the upper gi and see what it comes back as um @@@ yeah so um so we could do that yeah i'll have @@@ set you up for that test and if you don't want to take meds then we can get you set up for the test well he's not taking anything okay yeah we'll see what we see um so we'll set him up for an egd correct um @@@ oh you already oh yeah it's here @@@ hopefully @@@ another thing we could do is um @@@ okay @@@ okay um so @@@ lots of things can have you been taking over-the-counter medications like sudafed @@@ okay um and um you can @@@ you drink some tea how many a day oh okay so it’s not like a daily thing yeah uh-huh okay and you know we could send you upstairs and you could do @@@ i ordered the holter monitor okay okay so i want you to outpatient here then pick up the holter monitor and wear it for 24 hours i think it's on the third floor in the damen building okay so go to the @@@ building @@@ yeah so @@@ yeah @@@ yeah uh i'm going to go ahead and order one other test on you called an echocardiogram alright what it does it's an ultrasound of your heart you know like they do ultrasound of baby only this one is of your heart okay so uh make sure it’s not cardio @@@ like a @@@ scan @@@ picking up a lot of stuff that probably would be harmless so you're gonna go to outpatient to do the x-ray and the holter okay and then you can stop by x-ray and @@@ okay i'm doing the i ordered an echo for him @@@ so @@@ no no no its um we have to @@@ you they'll probably call you yeah won't do it today they will do it another time and then i'm going to have you go to @@@ um do you know where x-ray is did he give you the paper uh he @@@ at the elevator so that's cardiology @@@ oh okay so @@@ @@@ alright sir @@@ doctors visit between themselves okay sir alright then um and then you're gonna get so you're gonna @@@ alright very good sir so uh before @@@ and when you come back we can see what's actually causing the cough @@@ okay alright thank you sir okay you need this to check out yeah @@@ nice seeing you take care yeah alright have a happy holiday alright </doctor> <patient> hi i'm i'm coming in because um i've had a lot of shortness of breath and i i've had this cough that won't seem to go away mostly on exertion uh maybe like 2 flights of stairs so i've had this shortness of breath like at first it was pretty mild it started about four months ago but over the past month or so it's been it's been worse yeah yeah i think so i think that's fine uh no no uh the cough also around the same time it started off pretty mild but now i like i have it all the time uh no it's it's pretty dry no no wheezing uh no chest pain i guess with the coughing 'cause i'm coughing so much it hurts but not chest pain in the sense like it's in the area of my heart or anything like that um it's a it's kind of like a tugging feeling yeah no no headaches no no no no no no um i have had some weight loss actually about 15 pounds over the past six months no no no no no um no no uh no no no no uh no um no ah i have uhm a copd um know it's very mild i it’s yeah so i haven't really i was just recently diagnosed so uhm i haven't been started on any medications just yet yeah no no i live in a house with my husband no yeah so i i'm working in construction um i used to work in shipyards before but recently i've i've been doing some construction nothing heavy ah just working on some old buildings i’ll ust take the odd job or something that comes up it's not full time um were given a um personal protective equipment um for those concerns but when i was younger i used to work a in shipyards and constructions and like old buildings and stuff and i know there was some concern for not being ah properly equipped with the right equipment for protection and safety at that point so uh yeah it's possible i've been exposed to some things yeah asbestos or mold yeah you name it probably everything yeah and so it would have been yeah about like 30 years ago or yeah 30 40 years ago and i worked in those places for 30 to 40 years so around that time um i quit recently since i found out that i might have copd thank you uh once in a while i’ll have a glass of wine once a week um no i don't uh no um no not that i can think of no i am just my husband yeah no um no that was it but how like what can i take to make these symptoms go away ok ok thank you i blame my heart it's caused me the most trouble i had coronary artery bypass surgery in twenty ten along with an angioplasty oh and i forgot to mention that i've had prostate biopsies in the past last year yes fortunately i guess my prostate isn't as troublesome as my heart good i was falling asleep over there what's that yeah excellent um i still have that cough yeah it um hasn't got any better um as a matter of fact it's gotten um i think its a little worse um i believe i'm getting heart palpitations and i think it might be from that uh because i think it's something i get not only at the time i cough or right before i cough i haven't figured it out before or after i cough it seems like i've been getting little heart palpitations and i know @@@ probably so what do all these numbers mean we did that last year i think it was wasn't it yeah we did it last year i remember that okay you know i didn't know what's going on here um i think um a while back they gave me some pills cause they was thinking it was acid reflux that was before the uh any of the tests that you just described uh the cardio test or that pulmonary test that was before that they gave me some medication um which actually caused one of the side effects and i read those things unlike most patients i read them one of the side effects was coughing so you ask me will it really do any good i took these pills so i think maybe 30 days three or four weeks should be in my records i don't remember the name of it but um that was supposed i guess @@@ the cause but they was discussing acid reflux and uh cause i was like “acid reflux?” cuz’ isn’t that something you can feel like in your throat like you're about to throw up or something they said no this could be going on in my stomach and i wouldn't feel it but one of the side effects was coughing so how are you going to get someone on medication for coughing when one of the side effects is coughing @@@ well when you come back and you say well did it do any good so my answer to that is i don't know if one of the side effects is coughing yeah if it cause coughing – i didn’t know if it suppressed it and then i had a side effect oh no um and i guess i've been noticing i mean when i get up in the morning i'm okay and usually after i eat you know later on in the day is when the cough starts starting back so i'm thinking am i having an allergic reaction to something um @@@ i said in the morning time it seems to be okay then later on in the day is when it starts after i eat something so i start to notice that i don't eat a lot of acidic foods that's one thing about me i do not eat acidic foods so i'm thinking am i allergic to something cause i try to keep my ph balance in my day i take pills for that uh well i take a thing that's @@@ that's alka balance but you know i don't take them every day no i just kind of watch my ph i have a ph strips that i use @@@ to see what my ph because i want to keep it slightly alkaline @@@ well that’s going to help anyway because it helps acidic @@@ yeah i think that was supposed to @@@ i think it was a 30 day supply yeah two weeks or 30 something like that two to four weeks i just took whatever was in the bottle i didn't refill it uh uh @@@ @@@ that one didn't work so i don't i mean if i double up on something that doesn't work yeah my body is supposed to take care of itself and that's what i don't want to take pills to take care of this stuff so why i don't suspect the cough i want to find out what's causing it @@@ @@@ i think if i have a problem and i take something that suppresses the cough or makes me feel comfortable with it what stops then i'm taking the pill and i @@@ what's causing me what's causing acid reflux is it the food that i'm eating or i wouldn't think so because i'm not eating acidic foods so i'm starting to watch what foods i eat no i do not i do not drink coffee no see my thing is that the problem keeps coming and the pills take care of it and dilutes the acid in my stomach that means yeah the pill dilutes the acid in my stomach then i stop coughing but the problem still exists i want to know what the problem is so if you're gonna be taking something and we don't know what the problem is we don't even know if it's acid reflux i take the pills like they asked me to i took their pills it didn't help i took them as prescribed they didn't help uh it didn't help at all so to me @@@ it got worse if it works it helps resolve the issue but it doesn't cause it doesn't cure the problem right yeah i want to find out why why i’m having @@@ i mean because my diet and i changed my diet heart palpitations i don't know if it's being caused by the cough that’s kind of scaring me @@@ thing that monitors the beat of the heart yeah i think it just recently started in the last week or two @@@ @@@ yeah november last month okay okay okay oh okay so it's been doing this yeah it's getting worse then but now i get it almost daily it wasn’t daily back then okay does it @@@ something for the acid reflux @@@ what are the causes hmm i could definitely have that stress fatigue cause i been trying to get more rest i definitely try to get more rest since that started happening @@@ so i been trying to get more rest the last couple of nights i haven’t been having @@@ seems like i get like four hours five hours waking up @@@ well stuff on my mind you know @@@ i'm aware of that @@@ before so that's why i need to bring it down and try to eliminate all the things that causes stress so maybe that @@@ it helps yeah i need to get more of that @@@ love i'm thinking it's more the cough and i'm just trying to remember you know um i don't need to have any more so that's what’s happening okay with that i'm just going to get the heartbeat i don't know if it monitors the breathing as well with that okay that's a little more cardiac stuff i guess i want to do more cardiac stuff cause i know exercises can do more cardio stuff yeah i need to do more cardiac yeah i did real good when i @@@ then i think i'm fat @@@ more fat old age @@@ just to see if i cough and then if i cough i want to see if it's after i eat see if that occurs well i'm @@@ the body @@@ machine so i'm just gonna have to watch my body i'll take it cause this coughing @@@ you know we had this back in you know i had the palpitations but not the cough i had to come into the emergency room with that i had palpitations um nauseousness think it was last year in 08 i think that was they put me on monitoring they monitored me for a few hours they took an ekg on me and everything right right this is the smart way so whenever it happens it's going to record it did you see whether i had any more refills for all the pills you gave me i need a refill for um; i think it was a cream from dermatology i think it was um @@@ uh retin a right that'd be good @@@ yeah that kind of concern me more @@@ cough is when the palpitations kick in @@@ four or five times a day you know @@@ it's like an interruption you know i guess well no i @@@ no more of that i need to do more cardiac okay maybe lifting more i mean i mostly doing push-ups and i can push them up you know @@@ well i used to run i maybe do about; i mean i do about 60 and then i stop and then the only thing i maybe do 25 so probably like 100 pull-ups you know five minutes alright thanks doctor that's right uh-huh hmm no postnasal drip or anything like that no i @@@ an infection that i had when i was in the service @@@ no i don't uh i'm noticing i'm trying to diagnose it diagnose it myself and i think it's been more like when i get up in the morning i'm not coughing usually after i eat not 100% sure but i think it's after i eat then i start uh a little bit later on i start to cough but i don't know if it's because i eat or it's because it's later on in the day so i was just telling the doc here that i might start fasting to see what’s going on coffee chocolate a little chocolate here and there but not recently i haven't been my daughter loves chocolate so on occasion i might have a hot chocolate in the wintertime not in the summertime @@@ uh-huh uh i usually do teas some of the teas have caffeine in them some of them do have caffeine in them but i haven't even been doing that lately you know so okay right yeah do that it seems like phlegm gets @@@ in my throat yeah it seems like that @@@ okay okay no i hate medicines i would say in the last month i probably drank maybe two cups of tea a week it's not a daily thing but normally i do that’s when i drank green tea uh health tea @@@ cleansing tea or things like that yeah @@@ and where is this at @@@ and you gave me prescription refills right @@@ yeah @@@ one of those um body scans yeah i don't think that a body scan could pick up anything @@@ damen okay @@@ where is that so i take @@@ yeah that's what i'm

"<doctor> what is your family medical history i am sorry that must be hard oh no how is she doing now that is a relief any other family health problems that you know of date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@:@@ good to see you again hi @@@ here we go right in there sorry what was that oh they did uh right there is fine how are you doing today okay um anything specific you wanted to discuss i know you were recently in the hospital so we'll talk about that but um anything else or have you been doing okay since you were discharged the leg pain still having that uh-huh okay uh-huh okay yeah no i understand that um let me just fill something out there yeah so the thing is the last time we had checked his thyroid studies were in march of 2010 and they were normal the thing is we don't routinely check those with patients if they're taking the medications and you know you told me about some of the pains and i'm trying to remember exactly what else we talked about last time um you know you've been talking about the hip pain um and then i mean you know we talked about the medications i know there've been some questionable you know what he'd been taking and what he hadn't been but you know what else did we talk about that detail that may sure so i do apologize that we missed that you know like i said we had checked the labs just you know a year ago and everything was normal and you know i didn't really have any reason to believe he wasn't taking the synthroid that we were having issues or you know the thing with hypothyroidism a lot of times it is it you know in retrospect sure you can look it up and say these are classic symptoms but you know it does present very vaguely and you know if you think you can find reasons for those symptoms it's not necessarily the first thing cause a lot of these disease processes present very vaguely you know in retrospect it is easy to say you know i missed it but we didn't really have any reason to believe that that was the number one thing because you didn't tell me that he hadn't been taking the synthroid and you know the lab had just been checked in a year but i do apologize i'm glad you know that they were able to catch that in the er and that was taken care of sure uh-huh sure okay well how are you doing since you were discharged from the hospital okay you're taking the synthroid okay good symptoms seem to be are you still having the pain here kind of the back part of the leg here is it just starting up in the hip or is it just kind of localized okay you have it on both sides or just on the one side okay does it go all the way down your leg or does it stop cause you know like i think we kinda discussed this last time and it could be you know a nerve kind of a nerve pain that with some compression uh-huh and that's why you know i kind of wanted to start with the hips to see if anything was getting compressed there if there were any bony abnormalities i don't think those were ever done correct yeah @@@ we talked about but i saw those were not done um you know if it is there a weakness or just kind of a pain okay yeah i mean we could if we want to pursue i think we could still take a look and see if there's anything here otherwise if we you know there's other things we could do we could do nerve conduction studies those are a little more invasive and i don't think that's necessary okay so i mean i think it could be you know you're sleeping all night you're putting pressure here and that could be something and then once you get up okay uh-huh okay uh-huh okay sure otherwise the other thing i was looking through the hospital you know the discharge summary and i'm sure they talked about doing all the imaging studies there's also cysts on your kidneys um there was one on the left kidney that they wanted you know that may need further work-up just to make sure it's not growing or it’s not well there was one specific yeah he had one multiple small ones but there was one specific on the left kidney that they want a follow-up on you know in terms of re-imaging uh-huh yeah obviously not now but i'm saying that is one thing that we'll need to make sure we follow up on so you know make sure it’s not growing or you now anything other than just a simple cyst a lot of people have had you know simple cysts in the kidneys with not much to do there but uh-huh hmm yes yeah i mean the thing is you can't say it’s cancerous right now but the reason we want to recheck is to make sure it’s not growing because then you're concerned for cancer you know we do a follow-up study and if it looks exactly the same in a couple of months then we're kind of reassured that it is just a cyst but if it has grown then we get a little bit worried is this a cancerous lesions do we need to get a biopsy do we need further studies but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it um but you know in a month or two probably in two months you know we'll monitor yeah so so i mean that was kind of in the middle end of november so we'll say around february maybe we'll get a repeat ct scan and see how that looks okay yeah i saw that as well um okay so going back to kind of cause you know now knowing that you know there were issues with the medications in the past what was how can we prevent that from happening again what was the exact issue with not able to get the medication or not taking the medication he hasn't had a problem okay and taking the medicine every day okay well that's gonna be the key okay okay okay good any other problems today what's that drink good oh one beer year no it's better to cut down well he said one a day; i think that's probably the right amount okay hmm he’ll do two hmm okay the thing i mean you know we can tell you what we recommend obviously you know you go home and you know it's kind of up to you to go i think one or two is probably okay but i would try to cut down to one and eventually if possible to zero but like i said i know that's a you can have one glass of wine a day that's good one glass of red wine a day is good for your heart one or the other uh-huh uh-huh okay good good i can tell i can tell he’s not happy with that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that's good that's really good otherwise anything but you know i just we just saw him you know a month ago everything looks good since then blood pressure you know they measured it twice initially it was a little high it was 151/55 but they rechecked it 134/63 and then i read they wrote on here did not take blood pressure medicine this morning is that true okay @@@ okay yeah i mean 134/63 and maybe he set it up okay yeah so that's an important one not to miss that as you know so uh okay do you want to sit up here for me lean back here i'll try not to splash on you okay breathe normally for me alright okay nice deep breath for me in and out through your mouth for me okay again one more okay good okay any pain down here anywhere okay any swelling okay so a couple of things so i saw you have an appointment coming up in january with the endocrine right january 3rd so we'll check the thyroid levels this way before that i mean we only check about six weeks or so after adjusting the dose or restarting the dose so well no cause they started him again on november 19th when he was admitted so this puts us at about a month so six weeks will kind of be the end of this month end of december um so we'll just check it that appointment's on the 3rd at 2:30 p.m so you guys could come in the morning and get that drawn so that'll give it enough time to get the tests back or maybe the day before or is that kind of hard maybe just that same day just come a couple of hours before your appointment so is has time to kind of run in the lab i think that one for 2:30 um so that way you know just come in the morning get the blood test done cause that way you're gonna see that you know the thyroid specialist essentially so they can look at the numbers and if they need to adjust the dose then they can decide um the ct scan i think we'll do,we’ll go ahead and do in february cause they said about three months so i'll put it in the computer now and then i want to see you back in about three months does that sound okay so just before the appointment with me just come in and get the ct scan done and if the cyst has grown if we need to you know yeah exactly so we'll have some answers before next time um otherwise i think everything else is okay cause you know everything else we talked about last time um so i think those are kind of our big issues to focus on now and make sure the thyroid levels are responding you know appropriately and that cyst on the kidney has not grown does that sound okay okay so i'll put those in the computer so just the day of the endocrine appointment come in a little bit early to get your blood drawn and you guys know where to do that right by the entrance and then you'll schedule the appointment with me i think they'll send you something in the mail that’s what they usually do and before that appointment i'll put the ct scan order in already so you can just come in a couple days before and get the ct scan done so that sound good any questions okay great so we'll see you back in three months and i'm glad to see you're doing better okay just take that to the front desk yeah the only appointment we're really scheduling is with me because the endocrine's already scheduled um and i'll put in you know for the blood tests and ct scan i just put that in the computer oh okay you've kind of got everything it's a great system in this place here huh yeah good yeah i'm glad well alright then we will see you back in a couple months and of course if anything comes you know if anything happens sooner come back before that yeah if you can't get an appointment here the er or urgent care but you know alright have a good day it's good to see you again not yet not yet yeah right @@@ i know it </doctor> <patient> my dad had alzheimer's disease he is in a facility that cares for him now it is my aunt his sister helped me get everything set up for him she had a stroke last month she is home now but her husband is having to help take care of her the doctors said it looks good for her to have a full or almost full recovery yes it is! no not that i know of how you doing some lady gave me one of those tape recorders they give me one of them tape recorders so yeah where do you want me to sit down uh so far so good uh i been doing pretty good all except my leg is hurting me in the morning yeah but @@@ it is not arthritis and i don't find he's still having the pain but it is because that he he has not been taking his synthroid @@@ and um it wasn't arthritis okay and i'm a little miffed; i'm little ticked because when we spoke to you everything that i told you exhibited i told him i have to rush him here in the er and he was almost comatose and everything that i told them was it was classic of hypothyroidism so sometime maybe you know remember to listen to your patients everything that i told you know don't and i understand this is @@@ deal see i been a nurse for a long time so i do understand it but perhaps maybe not but perhaps we could have alleviated this and we could have skirted it another way had you listened instead of just maybe sloughing it off and i so i'm a little ticked you understand so it may not help him now but it may help someone else uh-huh okay we talked i remember distinctly remember i told you that the skin was ashen i told you i said just look at his skin it's just taunt black he was having the tearing of the eyes because i think you got him the appointment to go see the eye doctor all of this is related to hypothyroidism you know so sometime maybe you would think that normally i think that maybe you all need to go the extra nine just put one foot forward a little bit more and he was quite ill he was quite i ran every light getting him here and had we waited a little longer maybe the results would not have been as good it may have been irreversible and that you don't get back that means i don't get him back you know so and i know you probably get enough from the attendings but sometimes the little guy that we're supposed to be taking care of we need to take that extra step uh-huh okay yeah it can't be undone; we just go forward with it but i think that sometimes as health professionals we forget we all get tired we all have to remember you know there's this thing about do no harm and sometimes you know when we don't do anything it causes harm.you know so i can only speak from this side because he's my number one priority and i knew something was wrong with him you know for a long time okay we're gonna go forward i said my peace well pretty good so far uh-huh oh yeah yeah uh it moved down here it's not over there no more i don't know if it's because of my wallet both sides when i wake up in the morning after about after an hour and a half it'll go away but he did get this way over night but it just seemed like it seemed like @@@ a water in the car i call it you know right here on the side thigh that's what it feels like it feel like the nerve you know it's a pain you know when you stand up you feel a pain there when you walk you gotta walk stiffly so instead of it straightened out what if you don't catch me when i first get up you know about an hour and a half later it's not there so nothing to catch that's what i thought it's easing up now i was sleeping on the couch watching tv and uh that's when i stopped sleeping on the couch and getting in bed so if i sleep in the bed it don't get as bad since i’ve been sleeping in the bed i figured it might because of the couch thing you’ve got those pillows you know pillow to pillow to pillow so i figured maybe the pillow just changing the pillow that might be doing it i'm just gonna tell him yeah no that's not it we just need a number bed that's all we need is a number bed now that's what i'm gonna put it on i'm holding out for the number bed fine uh-huh hmm it's more than one i know there's one they were worried about they will but they will in maybe three months yes yes no but what he said was on the right there is one no problem don't worry about it the left side it's the one that is his term was @@@ and cancerous so for a he seemed not to have heard it i've heard everything that the doctor said he kept looking for more; i guess he was waiting until i finally told him i understood he said he didn't tell me that i'm telling him yes he did yes he did so would you tell him what he said yeah i think he said in three months okay i’m supposed to have this @@@ removed they are going to remove it on the 9th of january okay he's doing a thousand times most likely it'd be not taking cause i got plenty of medicine and i think his stomach was bothering him @@@ we and his stomach was bothering him because he wasn't taking the synthroid and i think that was the issue that we were not aware of because now that he takes it every morning he hasn't had no problems with his stomach no @@@ every day every morning every morning at 5 o'clock he's up so he's doing good yeah i want to know how many beers can i drink a day how many beers can i drink a day the doctor told him one one beer a day he drinks that you're not gonna stop him at one but he still gets three no one every hour no not cut off though that's not enough he drinks two because he's not gonna do one but he'll you're not gonna stop him at one so you have to have a cut off somewhere when the doctor told him three he told him that is enough so he does drink two a day and i don't what about wine then one glass of red wine and two glasses of beer oh shit so take the two beers take the two beers and i'll tell you he went to a birthday celebration and i think he had that day i think he had three for him that particular day because it was a celebration he just kind of had to skirt it a little bit but now we back to okay back to the two and he's been doing good he's real invested in trying i know that he's really been trying he is not happy but he's really been trying you know i worry but he's really been doing good and i know it's hard you know but my priority is to try to keep him here and keep him happy yes he did did i yes okay he took it that's that little bitty pill yeah where's the blue thing i think i must left it outside okay okay yes the pills are in there they are in there so i did take all my pills it's really good and then i make him take his afternoon it’s a little bitty pill is the tamsulosin that i give him @@@ yeah don’t worry not yet no no that's fine okay so we’ll need to get his blood drawn today right okay okay okay probably that morning maybe in the morning what's that appointment @@@ you'll see it then okay okay okay okay uh uh okay and they give me all the appointments again huh uh-huh what they do is when they give him another appointment they run them all again which is fine they just keep them in running order which is fine; you don't have to keep this one here and that one there everything is put into order so it's better it is it's a little hard to get to them but it's really good now i know i know that too yes okay okay doc alright thank you alright that'll do it did you get all your christmas shopping done you've got to get it done take care you waiting around yeah @@@ went to the mall that's what he keeps saying it's not gonna happen dd: @@/@@/@@ dt: @@/@@/@@ infopro/800511/job# 1300299 transaction #

pain when you take a deep breath in and where do you feel the pain ok does the pain uh like radiate anywhere or do you feel it just in that one spot and when did you first notice this pain ok uh have you tried anything for a for the pain ok i see and um did you have any trauma to that to that area recently like a car accident or i don't know getting hit in the ribs or anything like that ok um and have you had any episodes where um or actually rather like do you have any issues with lying flat and having shortness of breath ok and um have you had any headaches have you had any uh fevers or chills ok and have you had any night sweats have you had any changes to your weight recently i mean like over the last several months ok and um have you had any nausea or vomiting how about any changes to your sense of uh taste or your sense of smell alright and have you had uh a runny nose or a sore throat alright um and have you had any diarrhea how about any urinary problems and have you noticed any skin changes or rashes ok um and how about any uh muscle aches or body pains ok whereabouts uh where does it hurt um on your left leg ok is it is it swollen or have you noticed any redness of the skin there ok um have you had any uh like periods of time where you were bedridden over the last several days or or last several weeks ok any surgeries recently alright and have you traveled anywhere over any long distances recently ok yeah that's quite a long flight and i'm sorry to hear about um the loss of the family um ok um oh and that reminds me have you coughed up uh any blood at all ok um and um i just wanted to switch gears a little bit and ask about your past health have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions i see and do you uh take any medications for anxiety or have you i see ok so do you take any medications like either prescribed or over the counter do you have any allergies to um to medications or or environmental alright and um have you had any surgeries

any around anybody who's been sick ok um and uh any potential exposures to uh tb uh either in your on your travels or or anybody that you that you know of ok um and do you smoke cigarettes and do you drink alcohol uh how about the use of any uh recreational drugs ok um and in the family is there a history of any bleeding disorders or any uh clotting disorders ok um and any heart conditions lung conditions ok have you been tested for uh diabetes as well ok great um alright so um you've been experiencing uh so this this chest pain when you breathe in deeply since this morning um as well as some more difficulty breathing and some left pain uh left leg pain with with some swelling uh have you been after travels as well have you had any other symptoms ok so that was all i wanted to ask today on on history and before i went on to uh the physical exam we want to check uh vital signs and have a listen to your heart and lungs and um measure the diameter of your of your shins as well um but um it'll be important to get uh some imaging of your of your lungs um to assess whether or not there's a pulmonary embolism um uh because that would be one of the more um life threatening or potentially um complicating uh causes of what's going on right now do you have any medical conditions that run in your family that i should know about ma'am what about your mother or the rest of your family date of encounter: @@/@@/@@ time of encounter: @@@ you bet @@@ okay right okay sounds fine now um do have a primary care physician are you going to transfer everything here or are you going to keep your outside primary care physician okay okay okay the only reason i want to know specific i know who's going to be coordinating your health care cause it's important that if you want just one person so whether that's us or the other primary care physician that's up to you i want you to just have one person just so it's not two people putting in orders you can get it here then you're primary if i'm understanding about this you plan is to come here from your physician and come here for medications which other people have done as well and if you want to transition your care here then let us know okay um alright let me get some of the history from you just so that you @@@ it's @@@ alright now i have to document a couple of things so what medications are you taking okay and how much of the diovan okay okay and why are you taking the diovan as opposed to did you try lisinopril in the past and or okay just because so this is a sister medication um for the @@@ can be resistive to other medicines usually people do well on the other medications @@@ what happens did you ever have a cough with the medication and he said stop that oh @@@ okay and that's his number right there and where @@@ so i can see that right yes this is the one you let me know yeah @@@ absolutely okay so we got the diovan and what else are you taking okay okay and you're taking vitamin c okay @@@ okay how long do you take that okay okay okay no problem now okay and this goes in both eyes okay and that was the last one what's this one for okay alrighty okay anything else or is that it yeah some people take a lot more have you had any surgeries in the past okay and then are you allergic to anything okay um and it as far as your family history goes are your parents still alive may i asked what they passed from uh-huh okay @@@ okay okay okay do you have any brothers or sisters okay do they have they take any medications and the other one okay okay did you have children and @@@ and who lives with you and do you um do you work sir and what did you used to do hmm and do you smoke okay and any other @@@ uh like illicit drugs or @@@ okay this is just a laundry list of questions @@@ any weight changes i see and @@@ any chest pain or palpitations or racing of the heart and um how many pillows do you sleep on at night okay uh-huh okay okay and you don't wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air and you'll cough okay okay and you cough up any blood okay okay and any nausea or vomiting any constipation or diarrhea any blood in your stool and any rashes yeah okay alright and then as far as um what you've had in the past have you had a colonoscopy and why not uh-huh okay have you ever done the stool cards do you do that once a year okay and that was normal has there ever been blood in your stool okay and then that’s probably why you can do either one; you can do the stool cards once a year or get a colonoscopy okay alright i understand um has he been checking your blood tests and all okay @@@ just so i can have those results as well since we’ll be prescribing the cholesterol medication but you know if we’re reaching the goal and if we’re not i can always go back to him and say do you think i should go off of it and use this but just so that we can @@@ @@@ back to me yeah because if you're taking cholesterol medications exactly exactly and that would be helpful to have um and have you checked your psa right okay and did you have flu vaccine when was that what month okay and do you know when your last tetanus shot was would have been more than ten years ago okay that would definitely recommend to your doctor be something we'd ask you to get @@@ and have you had a pneumovax or the pneumonia shot okay if this is something that you want to have you just get one and then you don't need it anymore the rest of your life so you may consider that @@@ you don't need one okay why don't we examine you how about that go ahead and have a seat for me please do you check your blood pressures at home yeah what do they usually run can you bring your um sleeve up a little bit please um either way i just want to need to get the blood pressure no that's fine okay i'm going to have you @@@ then i'll put the left one on my arm focused and relaxed i don't want you; you're holding your arm up i want you to drop it pretty good 136/88 not as high as the nurses reading yes and like you said it can fluctuate especially just walking in @@@ but it's high let me take a listen to your heart and breathe normal deep breath in and out good again and out again out in and out good can you take your glasses off for me i'm going to look in your eyes look here at my nose uh-huh uh-huh good open your mouth real big ah you can put your glasses back on @@@ push me away; good now push me away with your legs good i want you to look at your ceiling like that good @@@ good go ahead and lie down i'll check your abdomen there you go you're ticklish i'll try not to tickle you then i usually tickle @@@ patients any swelling in the legs good i'll help you get up @@@ alright so now the way with the medications i'm going to start the diovan before i @@@ some of the medications we don't have on our formulary or it's not in the combo pills and we have to order them separate let me see if they have the diovan they do @@@ is that one today do you want it mailed to you or do you want it usually people prefer to have them mailed because because to tell you the truth the pharmacy down here can be backed up so what i can also do are three months supply with three refills good for a year and @@@ @@@ okay um but we don't have the @@@ in our formulary what we have to do is go from one pills to two pills exactly so the norvasc we'll go with 5 and @@@ the lipitor and then @@@ okay @@@ we don't have that so what we have is pravastatin but i don't know @@@ and so @@@ lipitor is in the same family as pravastatin but lipitor is a @@@ pravastatin or simvastatin so i can give you one of those alternate drugs but it would not be the same@@@ from atorvastatin to pravastatin we'll order simvastatin based on recent studies @@@ simvastatin so we'll order that @@@ norvasc @@@ simvastatin oh the @@@ and how many do you usually have okay no problem i understand okay oh @@@ okay and the last thing is the eye drops now i don't know if you want to have that @@@ so i'm gonna have to step out and see what cause the eyedrops i’m not familiar with so i need to see what alternatives we can do um instead of the @@@ and i'm going to order those @@@ and be right back okay @@@ the rest of these will be sent right to your house do you have enough at home right now @@@ @@@ uh-huh okay @@@ @@@ for your other doctor @@@ too @@@ i will @@@ um i'm a third year resident but @@@ you'll have me until june and then as of july 1st it will be someone else @@@ no no no i'm not going to be at the va i'll probably be leaving the state after this i'm going to @@@ i won't find out until march you can get dressed and i'll be right back alright sir um can i see your list the eye doctor information i don't know if that was a brand name or a generic name @@@ okay @@@ right there are other @@@ timolol ah we have timolol that's the brand name @@@ no it's the same thing @@@ lipitor is the same thing as atorvastatin @@@ and atorvastatin is the clinical name and so the @@@ that's the brand name and the chemical name is timolol there you have it wonderful that makes it very easy @@@ i'm glad @@@ okay uh you can do it @@@ it's nothing urgent yeah @@@ @@@ @@@ uh so @@@ @@@ any reaction to this @@@ @@@ yes @@@ i could explain what you need to do okay @@@ exactly alright sir well it was a pleasure meeting you if you need anything just let me know okay @@@ </doctor> <patient> hi i um i just developed uh or i guess i just started having difficulties with uh breathing starting this morning it was just very odd i was fine yesterday night and then just this morning i've had a really hard time breathing um and yeah i thought i should come in and get it checked out i don't know what's going on um it was kind of after i woke up and i was sort of um just walking around that i i noticed that i was feeling short of breath just walking around which was so weird you know that that doesn't really happen to me no um no yeah i kind of i guess it just hurts a little bit when i take a when i breathe in yeah i guess so yeah um it's kind of on my um right side it's just uh it's just in that one spot it's just this sudden and like like this stabbing sensation um when i'm like taking a breath in uhm actually now that i think about it it's it's kind of there even when i'm like breathing normal but it's not as bad when i take a deep breath it's like really really bad or when i um yeah when i like cough or like i'm laughing or something it just gets really bad kind of um late this morning uh i don't know it's just i just try not to take deep breaths i'm just trying to just take a normal breath and try not to talk too much and yeah just like not doing anything that worsens the pain no no i didn't no uhm no no i don't think so no uh no no no those are ok no no no no um yeah i kind of have uh it's just my left leg hurts a little bit i'm not quite sure why but yeah nothing else um kind of in the calf area yeah it is it is swollen actually compared to my right leg it's a little bit warm too no no oh yeah yeah i came back um two days ago um i went to um i went to india to visit my family there was a death so had to to go i came back yeah two days ago uh no uhm i i've had um anxiety and uh yeah that's that's about it i had asthma as a child but nothing since then uh no i'm just trying to um just trying to reduce my stress and and trying other other ways to sort of handle my anxiety before i i'm just trying to avoid builds actually uh no no uh i had my appendix removed when i was uh 30 years old no um i'm just living with my sister and uh yeah we we live in an apartment together no i don't think so no no no no uhm no i don't think so um just a heart attack uhm both my grandparents on my dad's side uh had a heart attack and uh diabetes as well um

brother had hodgkin's disease melanoma and prostate cancer yes i am @@@ @@@ as a matter of fact yes i was here three years ago for testing for agent organe and uh i haven't been back since but now i'm on your records because to make a long story short @@@ nothing really hurts okay but what i'm trying to do is get myself moved over to the va because my wife is retiring at the end of this week and by the end of the month i will be without prescriptions now i do have a list of things that i do take in case you want to see them i do i have this @@@ yeah that's why i'm here i really am between a rock and a hard place i've known this guy for 33 years he's a good guy my wife likes to take to to him okay i'll do whatever i have to do in order to get covered on the va i'll do it uh-huh okay i can do that so what if i go to him for whatever reason and he gives me a prescription okay okay okay let's try that it'll work why don't we go that way @@@ okay exactly you read my mind right in the right direction okay oh it ends with a k okay i wasn't expect to see such a young doctor you’re making me blush at my age @@@ yeah okay i take diovan for high blood pressure one 160 mg once a day that's it right there yeah that's what we did uh-huh uh-huh no i had something before diovan to be honest with you it was so long ago i don't remember but the diovan has been working for me knock on wood and i'm not wanting to give it up that's why i'm on it @@@ yeah @@@ okay i'm not sure i can remember @@@ i just have to get my file and i just pulled them out so i could give you the information that i use he’s in chicago on foster avenue @@@ same one but some of them could be different i just want to make sure that i remember to @@@ which is the choledterol @@@ vitamin c yeah and sometimes @@@ muscle relaxant @@@ @@@ muscle relaxer sometimes my back kind of @@@ up uh only when my back goes out knock on wood it been for a long time so probably within the last eight months or nine months i only take it when i need it i don't take medications if i don't have to and the last thing is i take eye drops @@@ i have @@@ i don't think i have @@@ small container @@@ i don’t have a print out yes one drop in each eye just once a day that's it glaoucoma yeah i go through an ophthalmologist in riverside no that's it that’s way too much @@@ no not that i know of no like sulfa or anything like that no no mother's dead and father's dead uh my father i think he died of a heart attack he was 73 years old he had open heart surgery when he was 60 he had two bypasses he smoked a lot he drank a lot and he did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done and uh so you know when his time came he went to the hospital to be checked out and he was at loyola and then @@@ someplace and @@@ he was in for observation and the next thing he died of a heart attack and my mother died at 86 old age @@@ my mother she was a type 2 diabetic and i never knew her to take any kind of heart medications she took eye drops for probably glaucoma but i have two sisters my sister sister she had cancer of the lung way back when she's fine now and she had something with her hip and you know all kinds of things and i don't know what kinds of medications she's on god only knows my other sister she takes probably an aspirin a year and she's on very minimal maybe eye drops @@@ very limited but she smokes that's

want to hear no i do not i quit about 20 years ago do i drink; you know occasional cocktail scotch no no no fine no in a matter of fact i was doing better well until christmas you know i was losing eight or nine pounds in august the fluid @@@ no no no that's a good question you know when i was in the navy they gave me pillows and i'd get down almost to the mattress i only sleep on one pillow and i hug the other and i have one between my legs the reason i do that is because it helps my back it's a knee pillow the other pillow i hold to and my @@@ but and then i sleep on one pillow uh no but once in a while i maybe have a tickle and it doesn't happen every night but it happens from time to time i think it's just dry air in the bedroom yes i mean not anything going crazy cough a little bit if i need to i'll get some water and that takes care of and i'll go right back to sleep no if i ever do that i'd be knocking on somebody's door i don't play games with stuff like that no no why am i here then (laughs) no no but with this crazy weather but i no uh never because my @@@ told me that i probably shouldn't cause you know if you're over 65 which i am uh you know you should probably go in for it but uh i never but my primary doctor he finally you know gives me the finger every whether or not @@@ right now is that everything looks and feels good so he didn't think there was an urgent need for it yeah yeah uh as a matter of fact i just did one not too long ago probably in july or august it was fine yeah no i mean he's a really good guy very thorough and you know if @@@ knock me out and stick me in the hospital but you know he told me from swedish covenant oh yeah he checks it probably once a year @@@ yeah oh okay i understand that okay and what if like they are over a certain age @@@ over a year and then i could get another or no yes you make sure the blood work and everything else to make sure you bet uh-huh that makes sense uh yes he does that quite often @@@ now i @@@ people ask some mean old guy i don't like to see them i don't want to hear anything about him but i do know from the test that i went through this one operation at north riverside not too long ago and whatever they did they took out a big vial this one time and this other one was piggyback and they keep on taking out vials and i hear a click and @@@ after a while it’s just kind of@@@ makes me go crazy so yeah the psa is one of them there are seven things that they check for and that's one of them that's one of them yes i did uh let's see it was getting more cold out it was at north riverside and i had just seen my doctor i went through @@@ they said it was free but it wasn't free they put it on medicare @@@ it definitely was probably september october yeah no uh-huh okay okay no i never had the pneumonia shot ever in my life okay oh okay okay that's @@@ uh i have one of those wrist things yeah uh 120/81 130 sometimes it gets something crazy like 119/75 you know they fluctuate and my doctor doesn't think it's all that great but you know it keeps me in line i think that she had 150/80 but i probably get excited when i'm around new people you know bring it up or take it off i should have wore a short sleeve today if that doesn't work i'll take it off how it be hard @@@ your doing okay yeah okay she said 150 okay yeah right okay definitely walking well at least you know i'm telling the truth i'm ticklish i'm already laughing no uh-huh okay yes that's a good question uh what's easier are they hard to mail okay okay a friend of mine comes here quite often and i've seen her a couple of times when i go with her and there's a lot of people and yeah oh okay uh it's 20/5 @@@ or 5/20 it's 5 of the norvasc and 20 mg on the lipitor that's how you get the 5/20 lipitor and the norvasc go with 5 yeah 20 20 mg cyclobenzaprine hmm okay now @@@ i don't know you know okay okay okay that will take the place of the @@@ and what do you call the other medicine simvastatin okay @@@ yeah 10 mg usually we're prescribed 21 a seven day supply three times a day and i never really i can't remember the last time i took 21 uh i'm really bad but i really should finish it up because once my back goes out it gets kind of crooked you @@@ @@@ yeah really rough yeah but anyway when it painful i try not to laugh @@@ she has a good time with it; i tell her one of these days god is going to punish her @@@ okay @@@ yes yes i do well where do they come from here from here okay you know i don't know @@@ but if you can mail them just mail them @@@ @@@ okay are you gonna be my doctor then oh okay oh where are you going @@@ @@@ going to be working oh okay oh okay okay @@@ okay okay no the eye drop that's not a generic no that's definitely a brand name yeah @@@ it's supposed to be @@@ and sometimes you wonder why they do that @@@ identify but whatever it's doing it's doing it good so the other @@@ i don't know their names @@@ yeah yeah oh @@@ oh uh-huh okay okay it sure does @@@ people say why cause that's when i started it and you know i said take your time and it worked out so and you said something about that blood test how often do i need to get that done @@@ and i could get it
